<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

    Posted on February  2, 2021
    
</p>


<p>These are some of the things I think about when trying to write clean, readable code.</p>
<h2 id="prioritize-clarity">Prioritize Clarity</h2>
<p>There are many ways to write any piece of code. Some will run faster, some will take less memory, some will be easier to test. And some will be more clear.</p>
<p>The first step to writing clear code is to make it a priority.</p>
<p>This means you have to deprioritize other aspects, like speed. There’s no such thing as prioritizing one thing without deprioritizing something else (when everything is a priority, nothing is).</p>
<h2 id="develop-a-sense-for-clarity">Develop a sense for clarity</h2>
<p>Writing well requires knowing what good writing looks like, and creating clear code requires knowing what clear code looks like. Reading well-regarded code can give you a sense of what good can look like.</p>
<p>A good sense for clear code won’t keep you from writing unreadable code, but it will tell you what parts don’t smell right.</p>
<h2 id="edit">Edit</h2>
<p>Your first idea for how to write the code will rarely be the most clear.</p>
<p>It’s often easier to find a readable way to write code after you’re finished with the mental work of getting the first version written down. Reading back over what you just wrote will help give ideas for how to improve it.</p>
<h2 id="start-by-explaining">Start by explaining</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure how to organize the code, start by explaining what needs to be done as though you are telling it to another person (or rubber duck). Write it down: “Well, we need to skip it if the user is deleted, or if the order is already in progress…” Take that explanation and transform it into code.</p>
<p>When laying out the code, it’s better to be thinking in terms of human communication rather than machine abstractions.</p>

<p>Add comments that explain why the code is doing what it is doing, or is structured the way that it is structured.</p>
<p>Just reading the logic won’t tell you why the author thought that was the right logic. There might be some business reason you don’t know about - perhaps users outside the US sometimes put the street number at the end of the first line of the address. Or maybe there is some little technical detail - this query is structured in this weird way to convince Postgres to optimize it correctly. These are added bits of context that don’t exist in the code itself.</p>
<p>Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking!</p>
<p>Even if it is possible to understand the reasoning from just reading the code, it’s hard mental work that can be very easily prevented.</p>
<h2 id="dont-mix-levels">Don’t mix levels</h2>
<p>Don’t mix levels of abstraction within a method.</p>
<p>This mixes levels of abstraction:</p>

<p>This doesn’t:</p>

<p>Mixing levels of abstraction makes the reader jump between thinking about what is being done and how it is implemented.</p>
<p>When you talk about what code does, you are talking about the current level of abstraction. When you talk about how the code does it, you are talking about the next level of abstraction down.</p>
<p>In the <code>welcome</code> method, what it does is send a welcome email if it has not already been sent. How it determines if the email was already sent is to query the database of past email records. Notice that the second version of <code>welcome</code> moves the ‘how’ to a separate method. It’s only concerned with the ‘what’, meaning it stays at one level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Make each function live at one level of abstraction, and delegate lower-level details to methods at lower levels of abstraction. Methods with a single level of abstraction tend to read like a story about what is going on.</p>
<h2 id="break-out-functions">Break out functions</h2>
<p>Big functions can (sometimes!) be made more readable by breaking them up into smaller functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes that function acts like a series of steps, in which case it works well to extract a function for each step. Other times, there are different decisions to be made, each of which could be made in a different function. Perhaps there’s parts of the function that act like making a decision and parts that act like taking action. There’s a lot of different dimensions you can use to split up a function. It takes practice to get good at seeing the right one to use.</p>
<p>Smaller functions have some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each bit of logic is given a name. This makes it easier to know what each bit of logic is for and helps you find where a bit of logic lives.</li>
<li>There are fewer variables in scope.</li>
<li>It’s easier to tell what the program was “thinking” when you look at a stack trace or run a debugger.</li>
<li>The small functions can be tested separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers would work fine with no functions at all. Functions exist for the sake of programmers, so make good use of them.</p>
<h2 id="dont-break-out-functions">Don’t break out functions</h2>
<p>The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) idea is often taken too far.</p>
<p>Now, it’s a very good idea to extract magic numbers to constants and have one copy of the logic for making a particular decision. Repeating those bits of code is a bad idea.</p>
<p>DRY starts to go too far when two functions that happen to share a handful of lines become a target for deduplication. Completely avoiding duplicated lines means that you’ll end up with confusing, nonsense abstractions that exist only to hold those few shared lines. This makes the code weirdly hard to change because the structure of two unrelated pieces of code will be tied together.</p>
<p>The test for whether some pieces of code should be deduplicated is simple: would anything bad happen if one was changed without also changing the other? If the answer is yes, then make a single source of truth for it. If not, consider leaving it alone.</p>
<p>The point of DRY isn’t to run a manual compression process on the codebase, it’s to avoid a dependency where two parts of the code need to be manually kept in sync. Remember, deduplicating code is not the same thing as creating an abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-configurable-functions">Avoid configurable functions</h2>
<p>Prefer many functions to a few, configurable functions.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve seen stories like this one: you start off with a clean function that’s called in three different places. You want to use it in a fourth place, but it needs to do something slightly different, so you add a configuration parameter. Then the first caller gets a new feature, requiring two more configuration parameters. A fifth use case is added with its own special parameter. Caller #2 is too slow, so you add yet another parameter for skip part of the work.</p>
<p>Somehow, your clean function that started life doing one thing now has 5 configuration parameters and does potentially 2^5 = 32 different things (or more)!</p>
<p>It’s much better to have multiple functions, each of which does just one thing.</p>
<p>Once you have separate functions, there will of course be duplication. When those shared parts need to be kept in sync, apply DRY and extract them to shared functions. This is easier if the function is already broken down into subfunctions for decisions and steps.</p>
<p>Remember, a few duplicated lines is fine! If each of the separate functions has its own for-loop over a list, that’s very acceptable duplication.</p>
<p>One advantage of this approach is that when one use-case goes away, you can easily delete the relevant function. You don’t have to dig around in the logic of a complicated function to tease out the parts that were for that particular set of options.</p>
<p>Readers of a special-purpose function will find it much easier to understand what it does.</p>
<p>(Note that this is only the right approach if you control all the callers of the function. If you function is part of a public API, then the reasoning here doesn’t apply because you don’t know what all the usecases are or will be.)</p>
<h2 id="dont-prematurely-optimize">Don’t prematurely optimize</h2>
<p>Race cars go faster than normal cars, but at the expense of having hard seats, making lots of noise, and lacking A/C. If you don’t know that your function is going to need to be a race car, don’t strip out the A/C yet. Leave the creature comforts in - focus on writing code that is easy for humans to read instead of easy for computers to run.</p>
<p>The same is true about premature generalization. You wouldn’t buy a dump truck if you don’t need to haul huge loads of things, so you also shouldn’t make your code able to serve all kinds of needs that may never happen.</p>

<p>Annual reports are part and parcel of every public company’s life. It is a document that the public corporations must provide annually to shareholders that describes their operations and financial conditions. In the U.S., companies typically file the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
One fine day, as I was following the internet rathole, I landed myself on the Netflix investor page for some reason. One thing to understand about these 10-K forms is that these are …. pretty basic. Imagine being transported back in time from the current beautifully designed web interfaces back to a text-based interface. This is what I was dealing with, and all the reports looked like these fine specimens from Facebook and Amazon.</p>

<p>2003 report begins with a <em>Netflix-DVD-in-the-mail</em> envelope design - very on-brand! It then plays on movie titles like Edward Scissorhands to explain benefits and features. Then, it ends with an infographic that makes it very easy to digest the annual numbers.</p>

<p>The 2004 report continues the tradition of a grand opening. It then uses direct integrations with famous movie characters like Spiderman, Austin Powers, and Frankenstein. This is my favorite report!</p>

<p>For the 2005 report, the focus seems to have been on the subscribers. I’m not sure if the profile pics are of the subscribers to Netflix at the time, but it’s very likely.
The now-defunct star-based rating system shows up as a way to represent horizontal bar charts. Somebody really put some serious thought into this design!</p>

<p>2006 is the first year when the design was toned down and only a couple of pages worth calling out. This report’s theme seems to be the mailbox and a mailbox bar chart that I can only describe as “atrocious.” What are they trying to do with the shadows? 🧐👀</p>

<p>2007, 2008, and 2009 are basically clones of each other. The design has been reduced to bare bones with only a couple of “designed” pages before the 10-K form. There are only a few pages worth calling out, but at least the bar charts are sensible and easily readable. 🎉</p>

            <div data-type="page" data-updated-on="1612552823625" id="page-601d7a506f42587aa4d93797"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-601d7a506f42587aa4d93798"><div><div><p>Today I’m resigning from The New York Times. Those are not words I ever wanted to write.</p><p>Growing up, I never even imagined that I would get the chance to live in New York City or to work in media -- let alone at the paper of record. I’m from a tiny town of a thousand people in the middle of the corn fields of Illinois. I paid my way through Christian College working as a groundskeeper, a dishwasher, a roofer, and at summer jobs in factories and on farms.</p></div><p>And yet, I ended up having the chance to work for the most important news organization in the world. And I have loved it. I have been able to collaborate with some of the most talented, passionate and creative journalists in the world. I’ve been so proud and grateful for what we’ve been able to accomplish together.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was hired as the first full-time audio producer at The Times, the audio department was just an idea, nurtured in an old closet with grey foam panels glued to the walls on the 16th floor. Now it is a pillar of The Times’ journalism and a model for the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with Lisa Tobin, Theo Balcomb, and Michael Barbaro, I helped create The Daily in 2017. Since then I’ve gone on to help create and develop series like Rabbit Hole with Kevin Roose and The Field with The Times’ politics team. And, of course, in 2018 I helped create and produce the most ambitious project I’ve ever worked on: Caliphate.</p><p>While I remain proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish with Caliphate, getting any aspect of any story wrong, by any degree, is a journalist’s worst nightmare. After Caliphate was corrected, in print and in audio, peers of mine in the audio industry, from outside of The Times, began to raise questions about why I had been allowed to remain in my position.&nbsp;</p><p>There are answers to these questions: When it came to fact-checking support for the project, the Times’ leadership told us that they had their own internal system in place for stories of this nature. That system broke down. And they did not blame us. In fact, throughout The Times’ reexamination of Caliphate, they told our production team that we’d engaged in rigorous and careful journalism. One masthead editor even made it a point to tell me: “I won’t let you blame yourself.”</p><p>But in the meantime, another story emerged online: that my lack of punishment came down to entitlement and male privilege. That accusation gave some the opportunity to resurface my past personal conduct.</p><p>Like all human beings, I have made mistakes that I wish I could take back. Nine years ago, when I first moved to New York City, I regularly attended monthly public radio meet up parties where I looked for love and eventually earned a reputation as a flirt. Eight years ago during a team meeting, I gave a colleague a back rub. Seven years ago I poured a drink on a coworker’s head at a drunken bar party. I look back at those actions with extraordinary regret and embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this happened while I was working at WNYC. When my managers there confronted me with how my unprofessional behavior was making people feel, I was ashamed. I apologized to the individuals that I’d learned I had upset or made uncomfortable. And I was punished. I received a warning from WNYC’s HR department that I needed to be more professional or look for work elsewhere. I was told to meet with a professional work-place trainer. I was a production assistant at the time, and the promotion to producer that I had been working toward was denied.&nbsp;</p><p>I took this reckoning seriously and I continued to work at WNYC for nearly two more years without further incident.&nbsp;</p><p>When I started working at The Times, in 2016, I was open with my bosses and colleagues about this experience and what I’d learned from it. They said that they appreciated my candor and defended me publicly, including in New York Magazine in 2018.</p><div><p>At The Times, I have strived to continue to grow and be a better co-worker and person, and not repeat the mistakes of my 20s. All of my reviews have reflected that. Each year as the team grew, I was promoted to higher levels of leadership. In December, my latest promotion was finalized: I was to become our audio department’s director of development. “Ride or die baby! I’m thrilled about this. You are a treasured colleague and an insane talent. So much to come! Looking forward to toasting,” wrote the assistant managing editor who oversees The New York Times’s audio report.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was not to be. The allegations on Twitter quickly escalated to the point where my actual shortcomings and past mistakes were replaced with gross exaggerations and baseless claims. Several people have even alleged that I am a predator and a dangerous threat to my colleagues. I have been transformed into a symbol of larger societal evils. As a journalist, it has been especially discouraging and upsetting to see fellow journalists make such claims or retweet them.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The entire experience has been extraordinarily painful. I know I’m not supposed to say that because people will claim that I’m trying to make myself the victim. I know that I still have a lot of room to grow as a person - I can be overly zealous and talk over people, making them feel unheard. I know that this whole letter opens me up to more public shaming and ridicule. But public shaming is very painful. That is the truth. So is leaving the job you love.</p><p>And yet, that’s what I feel I need to do. As the pressure of this online campaign has grown to encompass some staffers of The Times, it has led to a climate where, even though I still love the mission of this important institution, I feel it is in the best interest of both myself and my team that I leave the company at this time. I do this with no joy and a heavy heart.</p><p>To the journalists, editors, colleagues and friends who’ve reached out with words of encouragement and support over the past several weeks, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

		<p>Note on Accessibility</p>
<p>There has been some concerns about the contrast on this blog, unfortunately some find it hard to read light text on a dark background while others prefer it. I am looking into getting accessibility options for the blog but until then if you prefer to read dark text on a light background, this post is available on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@crippledscholar/when-accessibility-gets-labeled-wasteful-e84b3f674043#.2g5vucmbh" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>So there’s a debate going on, on Twitter right now between disabled people and people who either claim to care about the environment and or just want to complain about “lazy people”</p>
<p>The tweet that started it all</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1621" data-permalink="https://crippledscholar.com/2016/03/04/when-accessibility-gets-labeled-wasteful/orangegate-cropped/" data-orig-file="https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg" data-orig-size="609,799" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="orangegate cropped" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=229" data-large-file="https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=549" src="https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=549" alt="orangegate cropped" srcset="https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=549 549w, https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=114 114w, https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg?w=229 229w, https://crippledscholar.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/orangegate-cropped.jpg 609w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px"></p>
<p>Image Description: tweet with a picture of peeled oranges in plastic containers on a grocery store (whole foods) shelf. Tweet reads “If only nature could find a way to cover these oranges so we didn’t need to waste so much plastic on them”</p>
<p>The original tweet has been shared over 70,000 times. Whole Foods has apparently agreed to remove the prepeeled oranges from their stores. Environmentalists and those who hate laziness rejoice!</p>
<p>The problem is that this discourse completely ignores how preprepared food impacts people with disabilities. The most common complaints about the sale of these oranges is either the wastefulness of the additional packaging (which is true but somewhat misdirected as I’ll discuss later) or that anyone who buys this must be incomprehensibly lazy.</p>
<p>As a person with limited hand dexterity, I look at this and see an easier way to eat healthy food. I actively avoid eating oranges, not because I dislike them (they are definitely tasty) but because I have so much difficulty peeling them. Any attempt to peel an orange is likely to result in an unappetizing mess because I’ve squeezed the orange to hard while trying to maneuver it for peel removal.</p>
<p>I don’t have access to peeled oranges from my grocery store though I’d probably take advantage of them if I did. I do buy precut vegetables all the time because it is more convenient and safer for me to do so.</p>
<p>Preparing food with limited mobility is both hugely time consuming and potentially dangerous. While adapted cooking tools do exist to help offset those issues they are really expensive (I wrote about that <a href="https://crippledscholar.wordpress.com/2015/09/19/the-cost-of-unnessecarily-medicalizing-acts-of-daily-life/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Anything that helps make my regular acts of daily life safer and more convenient is always a plus. So I was one of a number of disabled people who pushed back against the wholesale shaming of preprepared foods. The responses I got were informative in looking at how nondisabled people disregard and try and shut down discussions of accessibility. Rebuttals to inserting disability and accessibility into the conversation included what I consider the most ridiculous attempt to maintain the moral high ground. It was,</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean accessibility is nice and all but you know that wasn’t the thinking behind this product. It wasn’t designed for disabled people.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what, that’s probably entirely true. Whole foods was probably trying to cater to the convenience aspect. This is supported by the fact that the protest against the product on environmental and anti-lazy grounds was so successful.</p>
<p>The thing is this argument is hilariously irrelevant. In fact it shows that things don’t need to be directly conceived as accessible products to function that way. In many way things that are accidentally accessible are better than things that are specifically designed to be. This is because things that are accidentally accessible are marketed and available to everyone and are thus likely to be more easily available that an accessible product which is likely only sold in specialized stores. Seriously, accessibility that requires no thought to implement is the best.</p>
<p>Other arguments I got were,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peeled oranges have a shorter shelf life so how convenient are they really?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is true and it indicates just how much planning has to go into living while disabled. I have to plan my meals around the fresh produce I buy more strictly that others because I buy some things precut. This can be inconvenient but it pales in comparison to being forced to rely more heavily on canned or other processed foods that have a longer shelf life. My disability doesn’t disappear just because a whole head of cauliflower will last longer in my fridge than smaller prepared florettes.</p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Peeled oranges are certainly going to cost more than unpeeled and isn’t that a barrier?</p></blockquote>
<p>Also true but here’s the thing, being disabled is expensive and costs for accessible products can be prohibitive. It is however easier to budget for the extra dollar or two that prepared fruits and vegetables are going to cost every couple weeks than the dozens or hundreds of dollars buying adapted cooking equipment will cost up front. This is a case where the cost should be the cause for protest not the cost being used as an excuse to protest the product. I’m all for my life being more affordable.</p>
<p>Other disabled activists dealt with other arguments. The person who argued most ardently with me was actually pretty tame and seemed more clueless than anything as they clearly didn’t think their arguments through and went away quietly when I calmly rebutted their arguments. Others were not so lucky. Things got a lot messier and ableist as Twitter user Ana Mardoll learned as she systematically tore apart those arguments (for a full view of this thread click <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaMardoll/status/705777638720167936" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Issues arose when protesters prioritized the environment over the experiences of disabled people. Though as Ana points out those plastic food containers are hardly new. They are a ubiquitous sight at any grocery store deli housing things like artisanal cheese, salads and mac &amp; cheese. Yet how is it that the wastefulness arguments crops up over something that is accessible, rather than the widespread use of plastic containers generally. Not to mention at least these look like the could be reused or repurposed. Where is the protest over bags of prepared salad? I guess peeling an orange is to easy but the convenience of salad in a plastic bag is to much to be denied.</p>
<p>Ana further points out that disability inherently comes with a greater need for product consumption. Disabled people need mobility aids and other tools that inevitably have an impact on the environment. Many of the people she encountered appeared to suggest that in the fight for the environment, disabled people are too inconvenient and should not be accommodated.</p>
<p>People who conceded that disabled people should be able to buy peeled and prepared food were sometimes still unwilling to give up the environmental angle and suggested that we should just ask the clerk at the register to peel the oranges upon purchase.</p>
<p>This is both an issue of hygiene because, I pretty sure those oranges in containers were peeled in an environment that was more controlled for hygiene than the store checkout where the clerk has been in contact with dozens of people and their money without the benefit of regular cleaning.</p>
<p>Also disabled people should not have to jump through additional hoops to get things which is both an unnecessary wate of time but forces us into a role where we must ask for help.</p>
<p>The issue here isn’t that the environment isn’t important. It absolutely is but environmentalism has most definitely ignored disability and accessibility. Basically if something is billed as environmental. It is almost certainly inaccessible. Consider the love affair with ogling (though mostly not actually moving into) <a href="http://inhabitat.com/6-eco-friendly-diy-homes-built-for-20k-or-less/" target="_blank">tiny houses</a>. No micro home is ever going to be wheelchair accessible and many of them depend on loft space accessed by a ladder for sleeping so even ambulatory people with limited mobility can’t use them. They are a popular trend in cutting the carbon footprint though. Downsizing generally is considered the easiest way to become more environmentally friendly. It is however just not really an option for disabled people where additional space and adapted devices are required for daily living.</p>
<p>Far to often if a location heavily touts its low environmental impact, you can assume it’s going to be inaccessible because they are cutting electrical use by not having things like an elevator.</p>
<p>I keep thinking of my stay at the <a href="http://theplanettraveler.com/" target="_blank">Planet Traveler Hostel</a> in Toronto several years ago while in town briefly for my sister’s wedding (before I moved here for school). It is touted as being very <a href="http://theplanettraveler.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank">environmentally friendly</a>. While there the owner bragged about all the environmental upgrades. The thing is you can’t get anywhere in the building without having to go up or down at least one and usually more flights of stairs. Stair that are narrow and pretty steep. I showed up the with my luggage and wearing my AFO so stairs not the greatest. I managed but it was uncomfortable and time consuming. If I was any less mobile than I am, it wouldn’t have been an option and I’d have had to beg family members for money to pay for a hotel (as I had been unemployed for over a year at that point and had spent the last of my money on the plane ticket)</p>
<p>I would love to see containers with prepared food get more environmentally friendly but more importantly environmentalists need to start considering disability and accessibility whether it be in finding more sustainable way to create the products we rely on to accessible sustainable housing. What I don’t want to see is people throwing disabled people under the bus because they’d rather get rid of a product than figure out a way to deliver it sustainably.</p>
<p>Also if your main concern over the peeled oranges was a rage over widespread laziness. Basically anything that benefits lazy people is going to be accessible to some degree so embrace the convenience (or just don’t buy it) and don’t add a level of shame to buying a product that actually makes our lives easier and which in conjunction with other similar products can actually improve our independence and quality of life.</p>
<p>Updated to add this horrendous defense</p>

<p>So basically disabled people should not be allowed to expect or demand better access to food because we never used to have it. *sigh*</p>
<p>and the argument is off …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nobody likes an addendum.</p>
<p>Appendices are great (ask any Tolkien fan). P.S.'s are <em>the best</em> (especially if they're from a penpal).</p>
<p>But addendums. Nope. They change the rules, after you've started playing. After the game's over, even.</p>
<p>I recently got dropped with this whopper of an addendum:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Orcein stains performed on blocks A3 and A5 highlight elastic fibers
wrapping around nests of tumor cells, consistent with vascular invasion</code></pre></div>
<h2>A lil' background</h2>
<p>Previously, on "Halt and Catch Cancer", I thought I was in the clear. Sure, I'd been <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/colon-cancer">diagnosed with Stage II colon cancer at age 34</a>. But the neato robotic surgery to remove my sigmoid colon (and my grisly barnacle of a tumor) was successful, with no signs of the cancer spreading to the nearby lymph nodes (which are essentially the Information Superhighway of your body's immune system).</p>
<p>Officially, we're talking a PT3N0 pathology, where N means the number of lymph nodes with tumor cells (zero, in my case, of the 21 that were removed and inspected) and T means the levels of colon wall that the tumor "broke through." N0 is awesome and T3 is not-so-awesome. My tumor was pretty darn close to breaking through the colon wall. But the fact that I had no lymph nodes affected was a good sign -- a good enough sign that no chemotheraphy was being recommended by my USCF doctor crew.</p>
<p>Now, after my blog post on this whole "cancer sitch," I'd been in touch with friends and other wood-workers who were, unfortunately, familiar with this process. One, in particular, has been highly tuned into the research and literature around colon cancer, and he pushed me to make sure I fully understood my pathology. He also mentioned that he's seen folks with my PT3N0 pathology do chemotherapy on a preventative basis. Given that my big missive in my last post was about "becoming your own health advocate," his advice hit hard, because I was already lapsing in my attentiveness. Frankly, I was exhausted from the surgery, relieved by the results, ready to move on, and the pathology report itself was confusing af.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what? I'm just going to paste it here:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
Sigmoid colon, sigmoid colectomy:
1. Adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated, invasive through
muscularis propria into pericolic adipose tissue, negative margins; see
comment.
2. No tumor in twenty-one lymph nodes (0/21).
COMMENT:
COLON CARCINOMA SYNOPTIC COMMENT
- Procedure: Sigmoid colectomy.
Result Information
All Reviewers List
Pathology PDF Report
Narrative &amp; Impression
Harrington, Charles
- Location of tumor: Sigmoid colon.
- Tumor size: 3.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm.
- Macroscopic tumor perforation: Not identified.
- Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma.
- Histologic Grade: Moderately-differentiated (low grade).
- Microscopic depth of invasion: Tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into pericolic soft tissue (pT3).
- Margins: Negative.
 - Proximal margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 4 cm from margin).
 - Distal margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 4 cm from margin).
 - Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative (tumor is &gt; 3 cm from
margin).
- Treatment effect (modified Ryan score, scale 0-3): No known
presurgical therapy.
- Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified on H&amp;E (orcein stains will
be performed on blocks A3 and A5, and the results will be reported as an
addendum).
- Perineural invasion: None.
- Tumor Deposits: Not identified.
- Lymph node status: Negative (number of lymph nodes examined: 21).
- Other pathologic findings: None identified.
- AJCC Pathologic Stage: pT3N0.
- Ancillary studies: Immunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch repair
proteins will be reported in an addendum.

Addendum Comment
Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA
mismatch repair protein expression on block A3. The results in the tumor
cell nuclei are:
MLH1 expression: Present.
PMS2 expression: Present.
MSH2 expression: Present.
MSH6 expression: Present.
Expression for all four markers, in most cases, indicates that the DNA
mismatch repair proteins are intact. This result should be correlated
with the clinical presentation and family history to determine the need
for further work up for Lynch syndrome</code></pre></div>
<p>Probably TMI, but this will actually be easier for me to find later, instead of spelunking through the oh-so-painful EPIC MyChart software. Am I allowed to share this? I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE.</p>
<p>As you can see, this plaintext nightmare is full of strange and wonderous medical terms. Yes, the doctors walk you through it but still... it's a lot. I did push them to explain the terms, like what negative margins mean and why they're a good thing, although I kind of forget already so I won't try to explain.</p>
<p>After this walk-through with the docs, I felt good about my plan. No chemo needed. Just ongoing tests and CT scans and blood work and colonoscopies over the next five years to make sure that the cancer wasn't back, led by the UCSF Cancer Survivorship Clinic. Sure, that wasn't nothing, but it also isn't that bad, considering how lucky I am to have caught this thing and gotten it removed ASAP. The idea was, after five years, I'd be back in the general population for risk of colon cancer. <em>Cured</em>.</p>
<p>But then, during my first Survivorship Clinic convo in November, I recalled that one line from the pathology... the one mentioning the addendum that I hadn't yet seen. I ask about it. We dig in, and we find this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Addendum Comment
Orcein stains performed on blocks A3 and A5 highlight elastic fibers
wrapping around nests of tumor cells, consistent with vascular invasion</code></pre></div>
<p><code>Consistent with vascular invasion</code>. Welp, that can't be good.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm immediately whisked off the UCSF Oncology Department.</p>
<h2>New faces and new tests and new plans</h2>
<p>A hospital is a series of interconnected rings, all slightly Venn Diagramming each other, kind of like the Olympics logo. As a patient, you tend to orbit one of the rings. But sometimes you'll Three Body Problem your way over to another ring.</p>
<p>In my entire diagnosis and surgery process, I'd never made it over to the Oncology (aka cancer) ring -- I was stuck in Surgery World. But, after this addendum, I'm now squarely in their circle.</p>
<p>So, what's our goal now? Well, now that we've noticed that my cancer has slightly spread into the vascular system, we need to figure out what to do about it. First, let's remember the good stuff - the rest of the pathology is relatively awesome. Next, let's get some more data!</p>
<p>We do these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signatera - looks in your blood for tumor cells</li>
<li>Oncotype - looks at your tumor and rates the likelihood of recurrence</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me reiterate that my explanations of these tests (and anything medical-related) is entirely my random-dudeman-laymen's explanation. I hope to provide one person's context and interpretation of these confusing and scary things. I'm open to feedback and information on what I can do better.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Insurance aside</h3>
<p>Insurance didn't want to cover the Oncotype test, because, of course. Insurance doesn't want to cover a lot of things, especially brand new "cutting edge" stuff, like the Oncotype test.</p>
<p>Instead, insurance wants to make sure that you really-super-duper-need whatever it is they're going to give you, to the point where there's basically no way they can say no. My doctors have been amazing advocates for me, helping make sure that insurance knows how important these tests and treatments are for my health. THANK YOU, UCSF.</p>
<p>Insurance is frustrating and scary. I do not understand it. I do not want to understand it. I wish it was simpler. I wish I didn't have to make sure that I was "covered" for things related to my health and my family's health. I also know that I'm incredibly lucky to have good insurance. I took a screenshot from my insurance app back in December:</p>

<p>WTF. That's an insane amount of money. But my life was saved, sooo...? The insurance company even assigned me a nurse to "check in on me" as a resource back in November and December, which sadly was more of a nuisance than anything else. And, then, when my company switched insurance providers at the beginning of 2021, this nurse service stopped abruptly. The whole thing's odd. But I can say again that I am extremely grateful to have had good insurance during my cancer treatment.</p>
<h3>Make a new plan</h3>
<p>The Signatera is clear, which is great. No circulating tumor cells in my blood. I ask the question, "Doesn't this mean I'm, like, good for life now?" And apparently no. They can't say that. They can only say, "We don't see anything right now." It's the balance sheet of cancer. Just cause things look good right now doesn't mean that next year or next quarter's gonna be the same. Past performance is no indication of future something-something.</p>
<p>Oncotype's pretty good, too. From what the doc explains, this test suggests that my tumor has a 12% recurrence rate. This is a low number and I should be happy about it. And I am. But I want it to be zero, obviously. Also, recurrence isn't talking about new polyps growing in my butt and starting cancers -- that can still happen. Recurrence is about whether cells from my now-removed cancer tumor are going rear their awful heads again, somewhere else in my body.</p>
<p>It's at this point that we get into the discussion around chemo. There's evidence that chemo can help reduce the recurrence rate even further. My oncology team brings my data to this cool-sounding UCSF "Tumor Board" meeting, and they advise a chemo treatment. The evidence suggests that we can bring down my recurrance rate from 12% to 6%.</p>
<p>But they also reiterate that it's my choice. I can say no. As my aforementioned friend said, "You don't do chemo recreationally." In fact, the doctors explain that if I were an old man, they might not advise treatment. But since I'm young and restless, it makes more sense for me to do whatever I can to improve my chances.</p>
<p>Duh, let's do this thing.</p>
<h2>So, what's chemotherapy like?</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, there's all different kinds of chemo. I didn't know that. I'm on a combo …</p></div></div>

February 5, 2021 | https://www.samjulien.com/managing-time-as-a-developer-advocate | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samjulien.com/managing-time-as-a-developer-advocate">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I moved from regular full stack web development (C# and JavaScript, mostly Angular) to the world of content, developer relations, and developer advocacy in August 2018 when I joined <a href="http://www.auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a>. It's a lot of fun, but no one tells you just <em>how much stuff there is to do.</em> At any given time, I could be:</p><ul><li>Writing a blog post</li><li>Answering questions on Twitter, Slack, Discord, or various Discourse forums</li><li>Making videos, either as a side hustle or for work</li><li>Figuring out how to integrate Auth0 with X language or Y framework</li><li>Building and improving programs like <a href="https://auth0.com/ambassador-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Ambassadors</a></li><li>Collaborating with other companies on content</li><li><a href="http://www.samjulien.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming</a></li><li>Building a talk</li><li>Applying to events</li><li>Giving a talk (whether in person or online)</li><li>Appearing on a podcast</li><li>Working with other teams in the company (like the SDK team or product marketing teams) to provide developer feedback and improve the product</li></ul><p>It can be dizzying! Without some good systems in place, it would be incredibly easy to work <em>all the time</em>. In fact, that's how I was starting to feel as I finished my first year. I felt like someone could wake me up in the middle of the night and my first response would be to start typing at an invisible computer or give a talk to the chickens.</p><p>I'm about 18 months into this and I feel like I'm finally starting to get some traction on prioritizing and being productive without losing my mind. So, in this article, I'm going to write out what's been working for me lately in my unending quest to balance life and dev rel. I don't pretend to have all the answers here, but I do hope I can save you some time.</p><p>My favorite way to write about what I've been learning is by first laying out some "cloud level" <strong>overarching principles</strong> that I've been noticing and then getting down to the nitty-gritty "street level" <strong>strategies and tactics</strong> that are working for me. As always, this is the stuff that has worked for me. Adjust to suit your own needs and personality!</p><p><em>Note: I'm just going to use the term "dev rel" from here on out for convenience, but this could be any iteration of developer advocacy, evangelism, content, community, or anything else. Think of it as a synonym for "that part of being a developer that involves building relationships and creating content," whether that's your full time job or a side gig.</em></p><p>As I've moved through this last 18 months, I've picked up on some high-level principles that are making my life better. Think of them as signposts along the road: they don't tell you exactly how to get to your next destination, but they point you in the right direction if you pay attention to them.</p><h2>Principle 1: Dev rel is a new set of skills to learn <!-- -->—<!-- --> embrace it!</h2><p>When you first transition to dev rel, it can be incredibly overwhelming. Most of the time, the reason we have moved into dev rel is because we were reasonably good at our engineering jobs but wanted to do more teaching and community-building. Suddenly, we've gone from "competent engineer" to "brand new developer advocate" and that <em>sucks</em>. This brings me to the first principle I want you to remember: <strong>dev rel is a new set of skills you can learn</strong>.</p><p>You are once again a beginner! You're back at square one (or square zero since we're all nerds here). If you feel totally overwhelmed or like you suck at your job, this is not because something is wrong with you as a person <!-- -->—<!-- --> it's because you need to learn and practice a new set of skills! Once I realized that, I felt so much better. So, first and foremost, cut yourself some slack (not Slack)!</p><p>The real magic comes when you not only accept that reality, but learn to embrace it. It's not that often in life that we get to learn new skills (though as developers we are incredibly lucky in that way). New skills mean new opportunities for creativity, new ways of looking at things, and new relationships. And that feeling of discomfort and discontent? That's growth as a human! Growth is good!</p><h2>Principle 2: Focus on shipping and improving instead of waiting for perfection.</h2><p>Perfection is the enemy of getting things done, but this seems to be especially true for dev rel. It's really easy to start a dozen projects, blog articles, video course outlines, and open source libraries <!-- -->—<!-- --> it's way harder to finish them. Why is that? Often it's because we like the <em>idea</em> of a hypothetical, perfect version of something more than the <em>reality</em> of the hard work it takes to execute something. When we go to work on that project, we get so overwhelmed by the disparity between our Perfect Vision and the blank page that we give up and go back to daydreaming.</p><p>This is a great way to get fired. It's way better for your job and your mental health to build and ship something <!-- -->—<!-- --> no matter how small <!-- -->—<!-- --> so you can start getting feedback, achieving some results, and improving on it. I love how <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Hoy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexhillman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Hillman</a> call this <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stacking bricks</a>.</p><p>A good rule of thumb here is to ship something when it's 80% done and you're stll a little bit embarrassed about it. You can always improve on it later! I learned this lesson a few years back and wrote about a process I use for myself called <a href="https://www.samjulien.com/feedback-loop">The Feedback Loop</a>.</p><h2>Principle 3: Don't try to automate too quickly.</h2><p>I don't know if this is a developer thing, but I have a tendency to overcomplicate things and try to automate them way too quickly. This usually comes from a desire to be <em>efficient</em> or <em>elegant</em> in my implementation so I (naively) add (unnecessary) complexity. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about: after six months or a year, you come back to the code you wrote and realize you can drastically simplify it. Why is that? It's because you know what's important and what's not due to experience.</p><p>The same is true with dev rel. My first response to being overwhelmed was to TRY EVERYTHING and THROW EVERYTHING AT THE WALL:</p><ul><li>Download all the productivity apps!</li><li>Set up complex email filtering!</li><li>Buy all the gear!</li><li>Over-engineer systems to automate everything!</li></ul><p>That was a quick road to burnout because I was giving myself way too much overhead. Instead, what I've learned is to <strong>go slow now in order to go fast later</strong>. I needed to slow down and figure out what was bringing the biggest return in order to find the ways I could systematize and automate it.</p><p>Incidentally, I went through this exact same cycle when I was learning about camping, hiking, and backpacking. I overcomplicated things and, over time, watched as the gear I needed eventually shrank to <em>exactly what I needed, when I needed it</em>.</p><p>As you venture forth in dev rel, look for those three signposts to keep you on the right path:</p><ul><li>Be kind to yourself and embrace that you're learning new skills</li><li>Focus on shipping and improving</li><li>Resist premature automation</li></ul><p>Okay, so we've got some principles. Let's get down to the street-level implementation for daily work.</p><h2>Strategy 1: Determine your priorities.</h2><p>Given that we could be doing a million different things at literally any time of day or night, it becomes impossible to do everything. You <em>have</em> to create some sort of decision matrix or rubric for prioritizing. If you've got a boss, I'd highly recommend you talk this out. Define priorities and "big wins." When <a href="https://twitter.com/KimMaida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Maida</a> was my boss, we did just that, and here's what we came up with.</p><p>Prioritize projects that:</p><ul><li>Other people depend on (e.g. that internal tool that other people need)</li><li>Involve collaboration with other team members or internal teams (a lot of developer advocacy work goes here)</li><li>Involve collaboration with other companies or create those opportunities (streams, joint blog posts, open source collaboration, etc)</li><li>Create opportunities for other people to learn or advance their career (programs like <a href="https://auth0.com/guest-authors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Guest Authors</a> run by <a href="https://twitter.com/kapehe_ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kapehe</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/ambassador-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth0 Ambasadors</a>)</li></ul><p>Notice the trend? It's <em>other people</em>, which is really what this whole job is about. I had lunch with <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Lengstorf</a> in Portland a few months back and he gave me the exact same advice: collaborate as much as possible. Dev rel can be extremely isolated at times, especially when working remote and traveling alone. Collaboration not only dramatically increases your impact (and thus helps more people), it also keeps you from losing your mind.</p><p>Of course, there are tasks you must do alone:</p><ul><li>CFPs, building solo talks</li><li>Experimenting with new tech</li><li>Working on your "personal brand" (I hate this term because it's so overused, but here I mean your personal site and email)</li><li>Creating most types of content</li><li>Learning new things to keep your engineering skills sharp</li></ul><p>How do we prioritize and schedule all that? I'm glad you asked!</p><h2>Strategy 2: Block out your schedule.</h2><p>Being remote and mostly autonomous can be great, but it can also lead to a sort of paralysis as you become solely responsible for your schedule. I wrote in my article <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/surprises-in-my-switch-to-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprises in My Switch to Remote Work</a> that it's kind of like getting rid of the governor on an engine.</p><p>Here's what I've figured out so far (and I'm still learning).</p><p>First, I make all meetings 30 minutes by default if I can help it. If it's going to take longer than 30 minutes, it's more of a brainstorming session. Nine times out of ten, 30 minutes is plenty of time to hash out who needs to do what to make progress. The rest can happen asynchronously on Slack or via email.</p><p>I've also started time-blocking my calendar roughly every Sunday night. Generally I have three types of blocks for working on projects:</p><ul><li>2 hours: dedicated focus time. I find that the difference between "completely overwhelmed" and "I know the next step" is nearly always 2 hours of focused work.</li><li>1 hour: maintenance. This is stuff like documentation, program maintenance, or tasks I need to get done.</li><li>30 minutes: admin or communications. This is the stuff I'm terrible at, so I book it in 30 minute chunks to stay focused and knock things off of my to-do list.</li></ul><p>When it comes to actually deciding where to put things, I follow the "big rocks" approach:</p><ul><li>Anything that involves other people, whether meetings or high priority collaborative work, I prioritize 4 days per week from 9 am to 2 pm.</li><li>We have Thursdays set aside as "no meeting days" on our team, so I use that day to do anything totally solo.</li><li>I do that same …</li></ul></article></div>

                        <p>India <em>should</em> launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.</p><p>We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/the-indian-government-may-ban-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html">proposed ban</a>, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should <em>buy</em> Bitcoin rather than <em>ban </em>Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.</p><h2 id="1-crypto-is-now-a-trillion-dollar-industry">1. Crypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry</h2><p>Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoins-proof-of-work-the-problem-of-the-byzantine-generals-33dc4540442">unsolved problem</a> in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.</p><p>Yes, you read that right: <em>trillion</em>. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">today</a>, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png 783w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!</figcaption></figure><p>So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s. And like all great innovations, it's led to the creation of remarkably valuable companies (like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken) and technologies (like Ethereum and Zcash). But people still don't get how large the space is. Let's give some more numbers.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/what-is-ethereum">Ethereum</a>, the number two cryptocurrency, is worth &gt;$100B. It extends the concepts introduced in Bitcoin to permit so-called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a></em>, which allow engineers to write programs that can send and receive money.</li><li>Ethereum has given birth to an entire sector called <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi">decentralized finance</a></em> ("defi") which is to traditional finance ("tradfi") what the internet was to paper-based media. Almost <a href="https://defipulse.com/">$30B in assets</a> are now held in defi for the purpose of earning interest, taking out loans, or trading assets.</li><li>The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were used to send <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-on-pace-to-settle-over-1-trillion-in-transactions-in-2020-analyst/">&gt;$1T in volume</a> in 2020, more than PayPal.</li><li>So-called "<a href="http://stablecoinstats.com/">stablecoins</a>" built on Ethereum have allowed the transfer of stable US dollar equivalents to anyone in the world; they too transact billions of dollars in volume every 24 hours.</li><li>The website coinmarketcap.com has a higher Alexa ranking (<a href="https://archive.is/wip/OJv3Y">#324 at last check</a>) than the website wsj.com (last ranked <a href="https://archive.is/wip/tgPHo">as #440</a>). In other words, a crypto website that lists the price of cryptocurrencies is more popular than the Wall Street Journal's official website! And that flip first occurred in <a href="https://twitter.com/adamludwin/status/893557870897184768">2017</a>.</li><li>The research paper describing Bitcoin has been cited at least <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=18205202439612985620&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en">13,000 times</a> by professors at places like <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses/cs251-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-technologies">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/introduction-blockchain-and-bitcoin?delta=0">Harvard</a>, and <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and cryptocurrencies have stimulated innovations in <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">applied cryptography</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07091.pdf">distributed computing</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/cryptocurrency-startups">More than five billion dollars</a> in venture capital has been invested in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups by the world's top tech investors, including Marc Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-1.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png 860w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Annual crypto transaction volumes are now in <a href="https://twitter.com/messaricrypto/status/1318985292347543552">excess of $1T</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thousands, millions, billions, trillions – the numbers start to stun after a while. So here's some qualitative commentary from prominent people and institutions to supplement the quantitative barrage.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/01/price-of-bitcoin-jumps-after-elon-musk-says-it-is-a-good-thing"><em>Elon Musk</em></a><em>:</em> The world's richest man has said that Bitcoin is "inevitable" and changed his Twitter bio to simply "#Bitcoin".</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1297640002604527621"><em>The IMF</em></a>: Cryptocurrency could "completely change the way we sell, buy, save, invest, and pay our bills" and "could be the next step in the evolution of money."</li><li><a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/pt/293821525702130886/pdf/Cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain.pdf"><em>The World Bank</em></a>: "Cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are<br>part of a tidal wave of new technologies that is changing the way production and commerce are organized."</li><li><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-treasury-secretary-larry-summers-says-bitcoin-is-here-to-stay"><em>Larry Summers, Former US Treasury Secretary</em></a>: "Bitcoin is here to stay" and the "financial industry will adopt the technology underpinning bitcoin."</li></ul><p>At this point you should realize that this crypto thing is kind of a big deal. And that there's an enormous gap between the economic impact of crypto versus its portrayal in the popular press, and that it might seem a little hasty to cut India off from an emerging trillion dollar industry.</p><p>But it's actually even more important than that. Because crypto isn't just an economic sector, it's a <em>civilizational advance</em> on par with the internet, and – if embraced rather than banned – can actually solve many of the issues facing modern India. Starting with national security.</p><h2 id="2-national-security-crypto-means-india-can-t-be-deplatformed">2. National Security: Crypto means India can’t be deplatformed</h2><p>As noted above, a <a href="https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/draft-banning-cryptocurrency-regulation-official-digital-currency-bill-2019">recent bill</a> introduced in the Indian parliament proposes a ban of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in favor of a digital rupee. One of the likely justifications is to protect India's national security. But as we'll see, Bitcoin and allied decentralized technologies are actually <em>essential</em> to India's national security.</p><h3 id="bitcoin-prevents-financial-deplatforming">Bitcoin prevents financial deplatforming</h3><p>First, some definitions. A digital rupee would be a <em>centralized</em> currency controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while Bitcoin and Ethereum are <em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralizedmarket.asp#:~:text=Decentralized%20currency%2C%20peer%2Dto%2D,central%20bank%2C%20like%20U.S.%20dollars.">decentralized</a></em> international cryptocurrencies that no single actor has control over. The administrators of the digital rupee at RBI would be able to issue wallets, freeze accounts, and reverse transactions. But Bitcoin is more akin to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-jpm-idUSKBN29A1IF">digital gold</a>, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.</p><p>It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045">3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.</p><p>Similarly, for the same reason that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-leader-condemns-twitter-facebook-blocking-trump-75123130">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/11/problematic-twitter-merkel-france-trump/">France</a> expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347902693537239040">national replacements</a> for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.</p><p>Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too that millions of Indians are currently <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/in/all/top-free/">dependent</a> on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like <a href="https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/">SWIFT</a>, PayPal, or Google Pay.</p><p>What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/amazon-viral-fire-photos-fake-misleading-leonardo-dicaprio/">fake photo</a> of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/amazon-fires-show-limits-sovereignty/596779/">invasion of Brazil</a>. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.</p><p>In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/India-permanently-bans-TikTok-and-58-other-Chinese-apps#:~:text=The%20ministry's%20June%20order%20stated,of%20state%20and%20public%20order.%22">TikTok ban</a>, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.</p><h2 id="3-foreign-investment-crypto-brings-capital-to-india">3. Foreign Investment: Crypto brings capital to India</h2><p>A second concern often voiced as a rationale for the proposed crypto ban is that cryptocurrency will cause capital flight.

<p>I reject big tech's monopoly on moderation. </p>
<p>In these strange times during 2021 I have found myself longing for an Internet controlled by the people and <em>not powered</em> by a global dragnet on the common person (often mislabelled as advertisement). These "advertisements" are <a href="https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comic/supernormal-stimuli/#page-1">superhuman stimuli</a> which track and follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile" target="_blank">all humans</a>.
</p>

<p>
I consider these sorts of "advertisements" to be a form digital stalking (an outlawed, mentally and emotionally abusive action). </p>
<p>Big tech nudges YOU for attention and nudges YOU to spend. Big tech uses computers to track and profile preferences, tolerances, sex, geo-location, race, political affiliation, and more with the aim of to exploring and exploiting you, your family, your friends... everyone.</p>

<p>
We must demand updates to our laws to prevent big tech from hiding behind their terms of service and corporate protections while claiming it is legal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking" target="_blank">cyberstalk</a> all humans. </p>
<p>Get yourself out of the loop! We are all absolutely addicted to this stuff. These psychic manipulations work on the subconscious of all animals; no one is immune.</p>
<p>The future doesn't have to be doom and gloom. We can build a better way. We may not be able to compete with their datacenters or balance sheets, but perhaps we don't need to. </p>
<p>We must keep the conversation going and we must not shut down speech. We must not be afraid to talk, otherwise we will lose our ability to find compromise and a healthy path forward. </p>
<p><strong>Starting today, Remarkbox is free.</strong></p>
<p>If this resonates with you, follow this two-minute <a href="https://my.remarkbox.com/setup" target="_blank">guided setup</a> to use the software anywhere that supports HTML (web pages, static blogs). </p>
<p>We already have our own platforms, it's about time we start using them! </p>
<p>Most of the groundwork has already been laid out. Let's roll up our sleeves and build! </p>
<p>If you have ideas, software, or tech which could be operationalized to help build a new social cloud, please reach out to me, I would like to hear from you. </p>
<p><a href="https://russell.ballestrini.net/contact/" target="_blank">https://russell.ballestrini.net/contact/</a></p>
<p>I leave you with this: be good to one another, use your speech to move people positively and follow the virtuous path, stay civil and moderate your own online discourse. </p>
<p>Those who control the narrative control history, and the future. Let us not stand idle during these times. We must not allow the powerful to have a monopoly on the moderation of speech. </p>
<p>Regardless of the labels and stereotypes tossed my way (even by friends), I choose freedom, and I choose to speak. I hope you do too. </p>
<p>We must not accept the old normal or the new normal. We have not been defeated, we must not be domesticated by the powerful. Let's build a better future together.</p>
<p>As always, please act civil when you speak your mind in the comments box below. I'd like to hear you, but I will moderate the discourse if things go sour.</p>
<p> After all I have that power, and so do you. </p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong>Food</strong><br> A common thing that can bring even the most opposite parts of the world together to enjoy and celebrate each other’s wonderful cultures. With that being said, it is only right that the tech world uses food to bring those interested in technology, together to learn more and more. Ranging from bytes, cookies, spam, and apple; tech continues to provide “nourishment” or knowledge to those looking to devour it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>So to begin, we are going to dive into the layers of our burrito and understand more about the OSI Layer Model. What is it you might be wondering? Well, the model represents a hierarchy of how the inner workings of a computer communicates with one another. The layers within the CPU provides users with a delicious taste as well as functionality for the system holistically.</p> 
<p>Next, let’s get into the ingredients of our TECH BURRITO!.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 1</strong><br> Tortilla also known as the PHYSICAL LAYER for which the burrito begins. As the name implies, this layer consists of the hardware components of a system or a network. This includes voltage levels, cable types, CPU, the wires etc. It is the tortilla that helps keep everything together, and if it gets cut or even broken, well, the entire burrito is going to collapse into a mush of toppings. The best way to limit things such as power outages that may harm business operations, thus breaking that “tortilla” there is a need to have redundancy for all critical hardware so that way if one fails, there is something in place to keep the inner parts running together smoothly.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 2</strong><br> Beans also known as the DATA LAYER. Whether you like black or pinto beans, they add texture and warmth that sets the tone for your burrito to welcome the next toppings you select. Similarly, data links function in the same manner. Each device is given a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address. These addresses ensure that communicating devices are effective in transporting the information to and from one another correctly. The MAC filtering method is also used to create a list that either permits access (whitelisted) or denies access (blacklisted), keeping your information safe and secure or keeping your toppings from getting to the physical, vulnerable layer.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 3</strong><br> Vegetables also known as the NETWORK LAYER. Yes people, eat your leafy greens and understand that vegetables or the network layer is very important. The network layers function is to transfer/route variable lengths of data sequences called datagrams from source to destination, a.k.a. packet forwarding. The layer responds to requests from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer. The most common protocols used are either IPv4 and IPv6. In this layer there are multiple security protocols in place such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec protocols are implemented to ensure there is a mutual authentication from host to host, host to network, and network to network. Much like our vegetables, the network layer protocols provide a sense of security to the other areas within the physical and data layers.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 4</strong><br> Chicken, beef, chorizo, fish or tofu also known as the TRANSPORT LAYER.- Is the most important ingredient in a burrito, especially this one. Whatever your preference of meat, it provides nourishment for our bodies, and the same can be said for this burrito in regards to CPU’s. The transport layer is the dividing line between upper layers and lower layers of the model. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used to establish and confirm there is connection between the host and/or host/network being connected.</p> 
<p>Once a connection is confirmed, a tunnel is formed for transporting data segments. Acknowledgments are sent from the opposite side for each data received. If a data segment is lost, there is a detection that takes place so then that segment is resent. User Datagram Program (UDP) is used in the same manner except UDP doesn’t have the checking system that is used in TCP and its main purpose is just to be fast. Transport layer security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communications over a network, so like mentioned all of this is important as it connects every aspect of the burrito to the other areas.</p> 
<p>And alas, we come to the final ingredients. The pico de gallo, cheese, and guacamole.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 5</strong><br> Pico de gallo also known as the SESSION LAYER. This layer controls the dialogue between different computers. It establishes, manages, and even terminates those connections. Specifically, its sole purpose is to make sure sessions are gracefully closed, and session support such as login authentication is completed as well. Much like pico de gallo, this is plain to see and important as it adds yet another aspect to our burrito.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 6</strong><br> Queso or cheese also known as the PRESENTATION LAYER. The presentation layer is responsible for data formatting and translation. This data is translated and used for the application layer. Character translation, data conversion, compression, and encryption occur at this level. Best examples of this include changing the language into english and the asterisks we see when we enter passwords. While some may have to add cheese sparingly (sorry my lactose friends), it is evident that in this burrito we need all the cheese we can get to ensure we are able to access our information.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredient 7</strong><br> Guacamole also known as the APPLICATION LAYER. This layer, much like guacamole, adds a delicious taste and is used in EVERYTHING. Every application we use whether it’s Chrome, Firefox, Gmail, etc. is at this layer. In lack of better words, it’s the windows into the tech world for users and the networks. To maintain security at this level, an antivirus software does fine (at the minimum of course).</p> 
<p>While this is only a short overview of the OSI model, it is important to note that implementation of security at these levels is essential to everyday technology. The physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers are all needed for a network/system to function. The OSI model may literally lack the delicious flavors of a burrito, it does fit well within the tech kitchen of ingredients and recipes needed to continue creating, revising, and implementing features for everyday users to enjoy.</p> 
<p>Bon Appetit!</p>

Over the past ten years, he has gained quite a record in fuzzing browsers. His primary focus is to ensure the security of Mozilla Firefox. He is one of the leading experts in Grammar-Based Fuzzing. As a team lead, Christian is well-acquainted with the human components in automated bug finding. </span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span>Psychological effects, emotions and group dynamics play a crucial role in software development, especially when it comes to automated fuzz testing. In this article, Christian points out these phenomena and shows us how to make development and security teams work together.</span></p>

<hr>

<h2>You Will Need Trust and Empathy</h2>
<p>During my nearly ten years at Mozilla, I often found myself somewhere between the security testing team and the development teams. Throughout this time, I was able to learn many valuable lessons. One of the biggest challenges I have faced, was establishing trust between those two parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By nature, the relationship between development and security teams is often prone to bad blood. But with empathy and appreciation, you can bring them together to work as a unit. In this article, I want to share my experiences to help you improve this relationship.</p>

<h2>Large-Scale Software Development Is More Challenging Than It Seems</h2>
<p>Developing a piece of software as complex as a web browser is far more complicated than many people think. Internet browsers such as Firefox consist of over<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/code-quality-tools-at-mozilla/"><span> 21 million lines of code</span></a>. Firefox has several hundreds of authors and around 2000 commits per month. The browser can be divided into several components that provide various features, e.g. rendering of HTML, CSS or SVG, but also multiple media support and a highly optimized JavaScript engine, just to name a few.</p>

<h2>Complexity Requires Specialization</h2>
<p>For each of these components, there is at least one specialized team. Their <em>domain knowledge</em> allows them to better understand the code architecture and they are more familiar with the contracts between the different modules. As a result, each team knows their code’s expected behavior and potential weaknesses best.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each of the individual browser components requires a thorough security testing strategy. Fuzzing is a highly effective way to achieve this. However, to perform well, fuzzing requires each team’s domain knowledge. This is just one reason why the traditional "lone-warrior fuzzing" approach is no longer sufficient in this scenario. What we need instead is a mutual trust relationship.</p>

<div data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true"><div><p data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifc2C5fLIWU?feature=oembed" width="200" height="113" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifc2C5fLIWU?feature=oembed" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></p></div></div>


<h2>No More Fuzzing Ninja-Style&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There is a need for a positive working relationship between the development and the security testing team. This observation does not only apply to our case at Mozilla - It is a problem that concerns managers and tech-leads in many industries.</p>
<p>So, please avoid fuzzing ninja-style. Don’t build a fuzzer on your own and in secret just to rapid-fire bugs at your development team. This approach is outdated. It might help you feel superior for a while, but not only will it deteriorate the relationship between you and your fellow developers, it is also the least effective way to build a fuzzer. If you can get your developers’ help, <strong>together </strong>you will achieve much more.</p>

<h2>Don’t Assume Equal Priorities</h2>
<p>Development teams often suffer from a lack of resources. Dumping a massive load of bugs on their desk can lead to defensive behavior. Developers will feel overwhelmed and perceive these bugs as “extra work” caused by you and your security team. Merely digging up errors in a project that someone else put diligence and effort into can create a lot of tension.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-c1Xctutp2bUdVrc-GXDXl9UFG0lH6jh19cfPDU96u359wTDJZcOr9GmveOs16L6Jqw-QXD9-L_qZNwjdNsVR9WHoGbnMD1MxeMLQcaQLlv_9algqwfsWDcxHxJIgBNBiQc2Apq" width="406" alt="Dont dump bugs at dev desk"></p>

<p>Don’t show off your findings. Instead, try to understand the developer perspective. They might have a different set of priorities than you. It is crucial for a healthy relationship between security teams and development, that both teams are involved in the testing process. This will also help the development team comprehend your findings better.</p>

<div>
<h3>Code Ownership Bias</h3>
<p>Code Ownership Bias, Initially known as “property oriented programming” (Weinberg, The psychology of computer programming), describes a phenomenon, where developers form an emotional attachment to their code. When other people start testing the code for bugs, developers might interpret it as a threat. Code Ownership Bias can often cause developers to exhibit defensive behaviour when security measures are introduced.</p>

<h2><br>Talk to Each Other</h2>
<p>To avoid defensive behavior, share previous success stories with the developers. These examples will help them understand your motivation and priorities. Also, make sure to offer your helping hand and show genuine interest in their projects. A relationship is always based on reciprocity. If you communicate more, you might find some valuable hints on where to search for vulnerabilities and errors. This might save your security team a lot of time. It will also help developers understand that your work will help them overall.</p>
<p>Another aspect here is expectations: It is not uncommon for development teams to expect things from fuzzing that fuzzing cannot deliver and the other way around. To avoid conflicts later on, make sure you define goals together and educate each other on requirements early on.</p>

<h2>Fuzz Blockers: First Impressions Matter</h2>
<p>A fuzz blocker is a bug that is disruptive to your fuzzing operations. Usually, it is a highly frequent bug that consumes many fuzzing resources. At the same time, it is hard to avoid or work around. Therefore, such bugs are of the highest priority for the security team. However, developers usually see fuzz blockers as low-priority bugs. And they are right, since they generally have little to no impact on the usability of an application. Here we have a prime example for very different priorities. It becomes even more critical if you consider that fuzz blockers often occur at the beginning of a testing process. Especially if there is no trust relationship established yet, dealing with this situation properly is vital: If the fuzzing team’s first response after deploying fuzzing is just fuzz blockers, some developers might think that fuzzing will only find “unimportant” bugs. This can ruin the first impression. Educate your developers about this phenomenon!</p>

<h2>Write the First Fix Yourself!</h2>
<p>Instead of feeding fuzz blockers back to the developers right away, I recommend writing the first fix yourself. This way, you will learn something about the project at hand. Being familiar with the codebase is especially useful if you are planning to implement continuous fuzzing on it. You will also learn more about the code’s development and debugging requirements. This might help you improve the bug-fixing process for fuzz bugs in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, If you manage to fix all the fuzz blockers locally, you can continue fuzzing faster. If you share your patch with the developers, ask them to look over it. They will surely appreciate your effort, even if the patch is not perfect.</p>

<h2>Start Fuzzing as Early as Possible</h2>
<p>Implementing fuzzing in a late stage of the development lifecycle can have a devastating psychological effect. Developers often spend months or even years on a release. Starting with fuzz testing right before production is the worst way to do it. Coming out of the blue and shooting 20 bugs back at the developers after such a long development time can be very discouraging.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png" alt="Start fuzzing early" width="482" srcset="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=241&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 241w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 482w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=723&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 723w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=964&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 964w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1205&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1205w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1446&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"></p>

<p>To avoid this, you should start fuzz testing as soon as the project is ready for it. But when is a project ready? Again, it is imperative for you to communicate with developers on this. Sometimes, very early versions of a project have too many known issues, and fuzzing would not contribute much. In general, fuzzing should start at the earliest version that developers consider stable enough for testing. This will ensure you catch bugs early on and give your team some time to resolve issues around fuzzing, while driving up its effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Watch Out for Experimental Features</h2>
<p>Sometimes it can even be helpful to fuzz experimental features. But again, you should consult with the developers first. Developers usually implement experimental features behind switches for a reason. At this stage, they are probably already aware of some bugs and vulnerabilities. Pointing them out by turning on switches without further consultation is usually not too well received.</p>

<h2>Become a Teacher</h2>
<p>Try to make the security testing process transparent to the developers. Provide them with insights on how fuzzing actually works and regularly share updates on progress, e.g. through code coverage. Make the use of required tools (e.g. to reproduce your bugs) as easy as possible for developers. Also, make sure they understand your intentions and ask them if they have everything they need to comprehend what you are doing. In the end, educating them will help you implement early-stage security testing practices</p>

<p><em>“At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.” </em></p>
<p>– Christian Holler</p>
<h2>Fuzzing Is Teamwork!</h2>
<p>This last point sums up the essence of this entire article. Security teams should involve developers in their testing processes from start to finish. As a company, you can achieve so much more if your teams work together instead of against each other. At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>The Mellium project is a collection of libraries and applications in Go relating
to XMPP and instant messaging. This post is a copy of a message sent to the
xmpp-standards list in response to a call for updates on XMPP related projects
from the past year.</p>
<p>But first: <strong>Why XMPP?</strong></p>
<p>I recently got asked (and I’m paraphrasing here): “why would you write an XMPP
library when trendier technologies are available?”
The quick answer is that XMPP is still the most widely used federated instant
messaging protocol available on the internet.
Despite the demise of XMPP in a few big chat services that users were familiar
with (HipChat, Google Talk, Facebook Messenger), it is still widely used in
video games (WarFace, Nintendo Switch presence notifications, etc.), in current
chat products (Zoom, WhatsApp, Jitsi Meet, etc.), and in industry.
XMPP is a core part of internet infrastructure and has a robust ecosystem of
both free and commercial products, servers, and clients built around it.
We need this infrastructure in Go.</p>
<p>Now, on to the status update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year the main Go module of the Mellium project, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a>
received a huge number of updates, bug fixes, and API overhauls, many of which
will be released in the upcoming <code>v0.18.0</code> release.
Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebSocket support</li>
<li>The ability to negotiate multiple virtual hosts</li>
<li>More server side implementations of stream features such as SASL and resource
binding</li>
<li>An implementation of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0393.html">Message styling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0333.html">Chat marker</a> support</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0202.html">XEP-0202: Entity Time</a> and
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0082.html">XEP-0082: XMPP Date and Time Profiles</a></li>
<li>Integration testing against common servers and clients</li>
<li>Better fallback behavior when looking up XMPP servers</li>
<li>Easier sending of IQs without having to think about XML tokens</li>
<li>Easier APIs for registering handlers against specific IQ payloads</li>
<li>XMPP URI and IRI parsing support</li>
</ul>
<p>The full (much longer) list can be found in the <a href="https://mellium.im/xmpp/changelog">changelog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="message-styling">Message Styling</h2>
<p>The change to <code>mellium.im/xmpp</code> that I’m most proud of in the past year might be
the Message Styling implementation which can be found at
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling"><code>mellium.im/xmpp/styling</code></a>.</p>
<p>The actual styling implementation comprises three parts: the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Style"><code>Style</code></a> type, the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Scan"><code>Scan</code></a> function, and the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a> type.</p>
<p>The <code>Scan</code> function is a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#SplitFunc"><code>bufio.SplitFunc</code></a> that is used to tokenize the byte
stream internally.
It is exported as a convenience to allow new message styling implementations
that behave differently or have other extensions built on top of it.</p>
<p>The <code>Style</code> type is a <code>uint32</code> that represents a bitmask of styles such as
“strong and emph” or “pre-formatted text and block quoted”.
It only contains information about the styles, not about metadata related to
the styles or the token stream.
For example, given a style you can know that the text is in a blockquote, but
not the level of nesting (if any) of the blockquote, or you might know that it
is in a strong span, but not where the start and endpoints of that span are.
The package provides the various styles and a handful of masks for various
common combinations as constants for the users convenience.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>Decoder</code> type pairs the <code>Scan</code> function with the <code>Style</code> type by
scanning for tokens and keeping track of the stream state.
It allows you to get the style of each token popped, and keeps track of metadata
about the styles such as the level of nesting in block quotes or the tag on a
fenced code block.</p>
<p>Here is an example of quickly tokenizing an input stream:</p>
<pre><code>	r := strings.NewReader(`The full title is
_Twelfth Night, or What You Will_
but *most* people shorten it.`)
	d := styling.NewDecoder(r)

	var err error
	var tok styling.Token
	for {
		tok, err = d.Token()
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
		fmt.Printf("Token: %q\n", tok.Data)
	}
	if err != nil &amp;&amp; err != io.EOF {
		panic(err)
	}
  // Token: "The full title is\n"
  // Token: "_"
  // Token: "Twelfth Night, or What You Will"
  // Token: "_"
  // Token: "\n"
  // Token: "but "
  // Token: "*"
  // Token: "most"
  // Token: "*"
  // Token: " people shorten it."
</code></pre><p>A more extensive example for converting styling tokens to HTML can be found in
the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/styling#example-package-Html">package examples</a>.
For more, see my retrospective post, <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2020/11/message-styling/"><em>Message Styling</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="stream-initialization-and-virtual-hosts">Stream Initialization and Virtual Hosts</h2>
<p>XMPP servers likely want to serve more than one domain, but prior to the
upcoming v0.18.0 release this was difficult or impossible.
This required changes to the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Negotiator"><code>Negotiator</code></a> type to allow input and output
streams to be stored on the session, and to the built-in <code>Negotiator</code>’s
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamConfig"><code>StreamConfig</code></a> type which is used for configuring options on the built in
default negotiator to allow the user to select the features in a callback.
Unfortunately, these are breaking changes, but it should be one of the last
major API changes before we can begin thinking about stabilizing the API in
v1.0.0.</p>
<p>The <code>S2S</code> option was also removed from the <code>StreamConfig</code> in favor of new
functions for receiving and negotiating a stream which mark the s2s state bit on
the session before beginning negotiation.
This removes a long standing redundancy, and also a bug where the first stream
feature negotiated wouldn’t know that the session was a server-to-server session
because it couldn’t be set until the negotiator function returned for the first
time.
The current list of stream negotiation functions is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialClientSession"><code>DialClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialServerSession"><code>DialServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#DialSession"><code>DialSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewClientSession"><code>NewClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewServerSession"><code>NewServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewSession"><code>NewSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveClientSession"><code>ReceiveClientSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveServerSession"><code>ReceiveServerSession</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#ReceiveSession"><code>ReceiveSession</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>While it’s not an exciting user-facing feature, one of the most valuable changes
this year has been the addition of integration testing against <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a>,
Ejabberd, McAbber (Loudmouth), and <code>sendxmpp(1)</code>.
We’ve already caught several issues both in Mellium and in some of the services
we’re testing against thanks to the new tests!
This is all facilitated by the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/internal/integration"><code>internal/integration</code></a> package which provides a
framework for starting an external application, generating certificates, and
passing around file handles.
It works by creating a temporary directory where any config files can be stored,
then launching the process using that temp directory as a working directory.
It also provides generic options for writing files to that directory that can be
used by the child packages, such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/internal/integration/prosody"><code>prosody</code></a>, to write more specific options
that write the prosody config file.
The integration testing packages also provide functionality for running
sub-tests, each one of which will get its own child process with all the
configuration automatically.
For example, to test sending a ping to Prosody and Ejabberd and receiving a ping
on Prosody we might write something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>func TestIntegrationSendPing(t *testing.T) {
	prosodyRun := prosody.Test(context.TODO(), t,
		integration.Log(),
		prosody.ListenC2S(),
	)
	prosodyRun(integrationSendPing)
	prosodyRun(integrationRecvPing)

	ejabberdRun := ejabberd.Test(context.TODO(), t,
		integration.Log(),
		ejabberd.ListenC2S(),
	)
	ejabberdRun(integrationSendPing)
}

func integrationSendPing(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, cmd *integration.Cmd) {
  …
}

func integrationRecvPing(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, cmd *integration.Cmd) {
  …
}
</code></pre><p>More complex options for loading Prosody extensions, generating and using
certificates and enabling TLS, changing the default username and server host,
etc. are also available.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>One morning I woke up and found that Telegram implemented a new feature called “People Nearby”. If you choose to share your location publicly on Telegram, you’ll appear in a list for users who are physically close to you. Not only that, but they’ll also see just how far away you are down to the meter. However, you don’t need to share your own location in order to see where people around you are located. These are perfect prerequisites to find out just how accurate this feature really is and, more importantly, whether or not it can be used to find out where nearby Telegram users live.</p><h3 id="privacy-101-your-location-isnt-anyones-business">Privacy 101: Your location isn’t anyone’s business</h3><p>If you’ve never heard of this feature and you suddenly feel the urge to delete your Telegram account forever, let me stress something very important: <strong>“People Nearby” is opt-in</strong>. By default, no one can see how far away you are on Telegram. You’ll only ever end up in other people’s lists by pressing the “Make Myself Visible” button. If you choose to try it out, remember to disable it once you’re done.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/share-publicly.png" alt="Telegram's prompt to share your location using the &quot;People Nearby&quot; feature"><figcaption><p>JUST DON’T PRESS THIS BUTTON OKAY?</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once you share your location, every nearby Telegram user will be able to look at your profile. This may include, <strong>if explicitly specified in your privacy settings</strong>, your user handle, your first and last name, your phone number, your bio and all your profile pictures. People will see exactly how far away you are. Strangers may message and call you. It is also worth noting that “People Nearby” allows you to see public groups in your proximity. Again, any user may read all messages, view all shared media and links and see all group members without actually joining the group. Joining is only necessary for active participation.</p><p><strong>Do not make yourself publicly visible on Telegram unless you have a very, very good reason. Be aware that you’ll end up exposing a significant amount of personal data to the people around you.</strong> I assume that the majority of people who will be reading through this article are privacy-aware to some extent, and I can only call on people’s rational thinking to treat this feature with the care that it requires. Be safe out there, people!</p><h3 id="a-feature-begging-to-be-exploited">A feature begging to be exploited</h3><p>There have been many different tech outlets warning about the dangers of the “People Nearby” feature almost immediately after it was introduced. <a href="https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html">Ahmed’s Notes</a> was one of the first to report its implications to the public and to Telegram’s bug bounty program. Telegram later responded saying that the feature is working as intended, and that users must explicitly consent to having their location shared with others around them. So as it stands, it’s a feature that is likely to stay.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/ahmed-location.png" alt="Screenshot of Ahmed's Notes on Telegram's &quot;People Nearby&quot; feature, showcasing how to determine strangers' locations"><figcaption><p>In fact, they use a similar method compared to what I’m going to present in this post, except I’ll be supercharging it</p></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you agree with how the “People Nearby” feature works is up to you. I will be sharing my personal thoughts at the end of this post. Regardless, I want to go on a quick tangent before I delve into the nerdy stuff. As mentioned at the beginning, I stumbled upon this feature randomly and found myself wanting to know how it works. I messaged my roommate about it who stayed in a different city back then. And within a few minutes, I found a new entry at the top of my list of nearby people: my roommate.</p><p>He had spoofed his GPS location on his phone to put himself six meters away from me. He then shared a screenshot of the app he used to fake his location and, indeed, he put himself right into my bedroom. This meant that not only was the distance shown for every user pretty accurate, but it also updated very frequently. I’m using the word “was” here because Telegram made the decision to not display any distances below 100 meters since then. However, we’ll soon find out that this is just a drop in the ocean, and that the accuracy we lose because of this change is easily regained.</p><h3 id="everything-at-our-feet">Everything at our feet</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram">Telegram’s Android messenger</a> is, like most of its core components, open source. This means that everyone can peek into the source code, copy it, edit it and create their own version of the Telegram app with whatever features they need. In Android, user interfaces and functionalities are organized into so-called activities. As such, the “People Nearby” feature finds itself in the <a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/eb2bbd32c17fa7f50009404f73b8a6a630f31bfb/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/org/telegram/ui/PeopleNearbyActivity.java">PeopleNearbyActivity</a>.</p><p>The code that requests a list of nearby users resides in the <code>sendRequest</code> function. It is called pretty much everytime the activity is navigated to and whenever the app receives a location update. The time period between location updates is ultimately decided by the operating system, but the Telegram Android app requests to receive updates as soon as possible.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/*
</span><span>    this code can be found in the LocationController class.
</span><span>    here, the app requests to receive location updates whenever
</span><span>    the users moves at least 1 meter, or after 0 milliseconds.
</span><span>    so basically, this is screaming "give me updates whenever you can".
</span><span>    see: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager#requestLocationUpdates(java.lang.String,%20long,%20float,%20android.location.LocationListener)

</code></pre></div><p>When <code>sendRequest</code> is called, the app uses the last known device location and sends it off to Telegram’s servers. In return, the app receives a list of nearby entities. In addition to their unique Telegram IDs, these entities also contain their distance in meters to the submitted coordinates as well as an expiration timestamp. From what I found out, users who share their location publicly will have their expiration timestamp set to the maximum signed integer value <code>0x7fffffff</code>, meaning they technically “never” expire.</p><p>The app then iterates over all received entities and puts them into a list of either nearby users or groups. Since I’m only interested in the former, I can just add my code before or after users are added to their respective lists. Fortunately, the Telegram source code contains a class called <a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/99f5637dda59bc405734342d3e2448701d63f2d3/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/org/telegram/messenger/FileLog.java">FileLog</a> which prints debug information to the system log as well as a file log located on the device’s external storage, if present. So all I had to do was to dump the user entity information to the file log on every location update.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>TLRPC</span><span>.</span><span>User</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>getMessagesController</span><span>().</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>peerLocated</span><span>.</span><span>peer</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span><span>);</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Additionally, I logged the location that triggered the request for nearby users with everything the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location">Android Location API</a> offered. Then it is as easy as following the instructions in the Telegram Android app repository to install my custom Telegram version onto my Android device. I then wrote a short Python script to feed the data I accumulated into a SQLite database to run some queries on it later.</p><h3 id="excellent-math-in-an-imperfect-world">Excellent math in an imperfect world</h3><p>So now we have the ability to feed all data that “People Nearby” provides into a database. How do we find <del>hot</del> Telegram users in our area? Let’s assume that we live in a perfect world where there’s no measuring inaccuracies whatsoever. Let’s also assume that the earth is a plane (unless you’re a flat-earther, in which case you don’t need to perform any extra mental gymnastics). If we’re trying to find the coordinates of one particular user, then we need to look at how far away they are at every logged location.</p><p>The process of solving for a point’s coordinates given a set of known points with known distances to that particular point is called trilateration. At every recorded location, we can imagine a circle with the radius of the distance to the unknown point. Ideally, all circles will then intersect at exactly one point which is the one we’re looking for. However, to find a concrete solution, we need at least three points in a plane in order to solve this problem.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/trilateration.png" alt="Trilateration with three known points for an unknown point in a plane, perfect intersection on the left, overlaps on the right"><figcaption><p>Trilateration in a perfect world (left) and in our world (right)</p></figcaption></figure><p>But we don’t live in a perfect world. The earth is not flat (what a shocker!) and GPS coordinates always have some sort of inaccuracy. This means that our own and other users' locations mustn’t be accurate. The circles, which are actually ellipses once mapped onto the earth’s surface, won’t intersect in one location, if at all. We’re more likely to get an area where a lot of our known ellipses overlap as opposed to a definitive point on earth’s surface. And to top it all off, we can’t be sure that Telegram is actually providing us with accurate measurements.</p><p>Luckily, all this is no big deal. Let’s think back to locations as points on a plane. If we were to make an educated guess as to where the unknown point could be, then its distance from our known points will deviate from the distances we recorded. This is an error that we can calculate and all of a sudden, the task of finding a point’s coordinates on a plane turns into an optimization problem. We’re trying to find a point such that the computed distance error is minimal.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/tg-nearby/trilateration-mse.png" alt="Trilateration but taking a guess for the unknown point, resulting in differences between measured and computed distance"><figcaption><p>Notice how the guessed point doesn’t align perfectly with the measured distances</p></figcaption></figure><p>Such an optimization method is minimizing the mean squared error. There have been countless explanations of this method in particular and I won’t be covering how or why it works. Instead, I recommend you read <a href="https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/03/13/positioning-and-trilateration/">this article</a> by Alan Zucconi who explains the math and its implementation in Python at the example of — you guessed it — trilateration. Instead, I want to touch on one more problem I encountered before delving into the fun part of visualizing all the collected data.</p><p>I said at the beginning that Telegram won’t show distances below 100 meters. If someone is within your 100 meter radius, Telegram will simply report them being 100 meters away for you, no matter how close they are to you. This appears not only on the frontend, but also …</p></article></section></div>

And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How much time went into preparing the iPhone demo?</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.&nbsp;</p><p>I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!&nbsp;</p><p>With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections. </p><p>So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic.&nbsp;The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Amazing!

I want you to fucking go home right now and tell me why I shouldn’t fire you tomorrow.” So I went home that night and I probably worked on 15 or 16 versions of an email trying to explain everything. But then I just decided to say “Steve, you know how I feel, but you’re the boss. You let me know tomorrow whether I’m fired or not.” I never heard another word about it.</p><p>The mythology of him mostly comes from individuals that didn't survive around him. The people who got close knew the rules, knew how to work with him, knew his core desires and what he was trying to achieve. They never really had problems with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Someone told me early on that if you do something great, you just have to acknowledge it yourself because you’re not going to get it from him except on a rare occasion. A lot of people who weren’t used to that would come in to present their product plan or whatever, and they would be seeking to make themselves look good and get praise from Steve. If he got a whiff of that, he would rip you down a peg.&nbsp;</p><p>He was usually right because the person usually didn’t do a great job. Those are the ones who flamed out and then had the horrible things to say because they couldn’t admit to themselves that they couldn’t cut the mustard.</p><p>He was a complex individual but he always desired the best out of everybody. He was ultimately very caring. He had his own relationship with my daughter from the age of 4 years old and let her come to rehearsals and events. He even asked her opinion a few times when the team couldn’t decide between particular graphics to use.</p></div><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Give us an example of when he went off on you because he expected better.</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><div><p>When we launched the Lifesaver iMacs (the color ones), Steph Adams [Owner of Adams &amp; Asscociates—the outside production company for Apple] and I were trying to bring them out from behind the screen and raise them up out of their pedestals. A week before the event and we were still struggling to synchronize them and make the motion smooth. This was before computer-controlled movement machinery was readily available.</p><p>After mentioning this to Steve, he literally says, “I know the guys from Cirque du Soleil, why don’t you call them?” With one week left, we couldn’t do that so we stuck with our way. It was a hand-crank thing. When you looked at it close, it was really bad. But when you were in the audience, you couldn’t tell unless you knew what to look for. However, Steve was on the stage watching these things not perfectly aligned with a little bit of stuttering. He wasn’t happy and we could see it in the video feed we were watching.</p><p>The show went off, no one ever noticed or mentioned it in the press, but yet he noticed. He pulled me and Steph aside. There were people all around so he didn’t scream or yell at us. It was one of those “I’m really disappointed. At any other time I’d probably fire you.” For ten minutes he went on and on.

<p>This is the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, II) discussion of the idea of a ‘universal warrior’ – the assumption that there is a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of fundamental truth for understanding war, either in the past or present, or else a useful blueprint for current life more generally.  In investigating this question, we are using Steven Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">recent video series</a> as our foil, since it is a more completely explained expression of this idea and one should always try to debate the stronger form of the opposing argument.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">Last time we took a look at the social place of people involved in war</a>.  We found that, far from there being a universal combatant, distinctions between soldiers and warriors are both significant for the present and important for understanding the past.  Moreover, beyond that simple dichotomy, the idea of a universal war experience in turn conceals the basic fact that many people who were neither warriors nor soldiers, not properly combatants of any kind, experienced war in unique ways, be they victims of warfare, homefront supporters, or economically invested in the enterprise.  Already we have seen that there’s far more than just one sort of person <em>with</em> a war experience.</p>



<p>This week (and next), we’re narrowing our focus just to the combatants and asking to what degree is even the experience of combat and soldiering (or ‘warrioring’) common.  Does it evoke the same emotions or require the same kinds of character?  Is it conditioned on the same values?  Does it involve the same activities or experiences?  Is combat understood the same, from one society to another?</p>



<p>Even so narrowed, our topic is necessarily massive, since we are considering the experience of <em>all</em> wars at <em>all</em> times.  But fortunately (for the wear and tear on my keyboard, if nothing else) our thesis – that there are quite a lot of broad universals in the war experience – does not need to be tested <em>everywhere</em> if it can be shown to fail in many places.  Consequently, we are going to bounce around a bit here; I hope the reader will understand that I mean these examples to be broadly representative, rather than exhaustive.</p>



<p>If that method seems a bit patchwork, it is important to remember just how <em>expansive</em> the argument implied by this notion of a ‘universal’ warrior or war experience is.  <strong>In arguing for a ‘warrior archetype’ that recurs in all cultures</strong> (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-eight/">as Steven Pressfield does</a>),<strong> or more obliquely in arguing that some given sort of long vanished ‘warrior culture’ </strong>(like the Spartans) <strong>provides material for emulation today, they are making a claim for a <em>human universal</em>, and a profound one at that</strong>.  After all, the suggestion is not that, for instance, some particular Spartan (or knightly, or Viking, or Samurai, or Apache, or…) tactic or weapon should today be used, but that the <em>ethos</em> and worldview of those ‘warriors’ is valuable because it taps into a true human <em>constant</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Because after all, a lot has changed!</strong>  We no longer fight with spears, or muskets.  Our wars are, in some obvious ways, vastly different from the conflicts of the past.  <strong>Yet for these past values, social systems, or habits to be directly applicable to the present, <em>something</em> would have to be fundamentally constant, at a deep and fairly profound level, in human conflict</strong>.  And it has to be something rather more than ‘people die in war, and that is sad for some people.’  After all, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html">people die in logging</a>, and you don’t hear all of these fellows waxing lyrical about the ‘universal lumberjack’ (though I can assure you, if it does exist well…<a href="https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM">then he’s a lumberjack and he’s ok</a>).  It has to be something more than ‘war is scary’ because after all so too is running <em>into </em>burning buildings, but we’re not discussing patterning our lives around the ‘universal firefighter’ either.  There would have to be some more profound truth to the phrase – to abuse the <em>Fallout</em> series – that ‘War, war never changes.’</p>



<p>And that is a thesis we can test!  Does war change from one culture to the next?  From one period to the next?  From one place to the next?  Let’s find out!</p>

<h2>Raids and Battles</h2>



<p>So what is the experience of combat like?  Well, first we have to ask, <em>what sort of combat do you mean?</em></p>



<p>As I’ve noted before, the branch of military history most focused on the experience of combat is what is sometimes called the ‘Face of Battle’ school, after John Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle</em> (1976).  Taking three battles from English history (Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme), Keegan aimed to reconstruct the experience of those battles in its own long chapter, beginning with the campaign that led to them, then discussing the interaction of men and weapons (infantry vs. cavalry, cavalry vs. cavalry and so on) seeking to use the physics of the battlefield to explain how these interactions would go.  He then focuses on how men cohered in the face of terror; then on to the casualties and the aftermath.</p>



<p>We might imagine that this standard order (replicated, I might add, in <em>The Western Way of War </em>(1989), albeit with more problems of evidence) implies a standard sequence of events, moments and emotions in a battle.</p>



<p>Except that for most of the human experience, this sort of battle was rare and generally indecisive when it did happen (a point which leads to the marvelous title of the upcoming, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Face-Battle-Forgotten-Experience/dp/0190920645">The Other Face of Battle</a></em>).  This ‘Face of Battle’ kind of war – formally constituted field armies meeting in set-piece battles out on open fields, with a clearly defined ‘peace’ before and after the war, along with a zone of conflict and a ‘home front’ – is the kind of war modern folks tend to be quickest to imagine, because in most of the industrialized world, we imagine this as <em>our</em> way of war.  But it not the oldest, or most common, or original way of war.</p>



<p>The oldest way of war was what Native North Americans called – evocatively – the ‘cutting off’ way of war (a phrase I am borrowing from W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America” in <em>Empires and Indigines</em>, ed. W. Lee (2011)), but which was common among non-state peoples <em>everywhere</em> in the world for the vast stretch of human history (and one may easily argue much of modern insurgency and terrorism is merely this same toolkit, updated with modern weapons).  <a href="https://youtu.be/4I8kic8xZh8">The goal of such warfare was not to subjugate a population but to drive them off, forcing them to vacate resource-rich land which could then be exploited by your group</a>.  To do this, you wanted to inflict maximum damage (casualties inflicted, animals rustled, goods stolen, people captured) at minimum risk, until the lopsided balance of pain you inflicted forced the enemy to simply move away from you to get out of your operational range.</p>



<p>The main tool of this form of warfare (detailed more extensively in A. Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) and L. Keeley, <em>War Before Civilization</em> (1996)) was the raid.  Rather than announcing your movements, a war party would attempt to advance into enemy territory in secret, hoping (in the best case) to catch an enemy village or camp unawares (typically by night) so that the population could be killed or captured (<em>mostly</em> killed; these are mostly non-specialized societies with limited ability to incorporate large numbers of subjugated captives) safely.  Then you <em>quickly</em> get out of enemy territory before villages or camps allied to your target can retaliate.  If you detected an incoming raid, you might rally up <em>your</em> allied villages or camps and ambush the ambusher in an equally lopsided engagement.</p>



<p>Only rarely in this did a <em>battle</em> result – typically when both the surprise of the raid and the surprise of the counter-raid ambush failed.  At that point, with the chance for surprise utterly lost, both sides might line up and exchange missile fire (arrows, javelins) at fairly long range.  Casualties in these battles were generally very low – instead the battle served both as a display of valor and a signal of resolve by both sides to continue the conflict.  That isn’t to say these wars were bloodless – indeed the overall level of military mortality was much <em>higher</em> than in ‘pitched battle’ cultures, but the killing was done almost entirely in the ambush and the raid.</p>



<p><strong>We may call this the first system of war.</strong>  It is the oldest, but as noted above, never entirely goes away.  We tend to call this style ‘asymmetric’ or ‘unconventional’ war, but it is the <em>most</em> conventional war – it was the first convention, after all.  It is also sometimes denigrated as primitive, but should not be judged so quickly – first system armies have managed to frustrate far stronger opponents when terrain and politics were favorable.</p>

<p>What changed?  Very briefly, agriculture, cities and the state.  Agriculture created a stationary population that both wouldn’t move but which could also be dominated, subjugated and have their production extracted from them.  Their wealth was clustered in towns which could be fortified with walls that would resist any quick raid, but control of that fortified town center (and its administrative apparatus of taxation) meant control of the countryside and its resources.  Taking such a town meant a siege – delivering a large body of troops and keeping them there long enough to either breach the walls or starve out the town into surrender.  This created a war where …</p></div></div>

<p>Disqus is a free commenting system and a great example of "if you're not paying for it, you become the product". Unfortunately, in Disqus' case, your website visitors become the product too.</p><p>Today, I'm going to analyze what happens when you embed Disqus on your website.</p><p>I signed up at <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and added the installation code to a <strong>blank page</strong> (So, I'm sure every HTTP request that the browser makes is from Disqus).</p><p>Disqus makes 76 HTTP requests and fetches 2MB of data! (even with 0 comments). And, it took 7 seconds to load.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tCZxbmi.png" alt="Disqus HTTP Requests"></p><p>Disqus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">was acquired</a> by an advertising company called Zeta Global in 2017. Obviously, advertising companies do everything to increase their revenue (Ex: the Big G).</p><p>I analyzed the network requests log. Disqus makes HTTP requests to 11 different third-party domains through the browser. <strong>All of these websites are trackers/pixels</strong> (Even some were detected as malware by my security guard).</p><p>Here are the external domains:</p><ul><li><a href="https://viglink.com/">viglink.com</a>* - One of Disqus's major partners. Disqus use Viglink to personalize ads.</li><li><a href="http://io.narrative.io/">io.narrative.io</a> - "The data streaming platform that makes it easy to buy, sell, and win."</li><li><a href="http://live.rezync.com/">live.rezync.com</a> - a pixel website</li><li><a href="https://idsync.rlcdn.com/">idsync.rlcdn.com</a> - another pixel (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://netc.sfr.fr/">netc.sfr.fr</a> - another pixel (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://p.rfihub.com/">p.rfihub.com</a> - another pixel, malware reports on Google (website returns 404)</li><li><a href="https://pixel.tapad.com/">pixel.tapad.com</a> - pixel, main site titled "WE PROVIDE THE WORLD’S LEADING DIGITAL CROSS-DEVICE GRAPH"</li><li><a href="http://pippio.com/">pippio.com</a> - redirects to liveramp.com, titled "Build better data-driven customer experiences."</li><li><a href="https://ei.rlcdn.com/">ei.rlcdn.com</a>, <a href="https://idsync.rlcdn.com/">idsync.rlcdn.com</a> - website returns 404, GIF pixel used</li><li><a href="http://tag.clrstm.com/">tag.clrstm.com</a></li><li><a href="https://ib.adnxs.com/">ib.adnxs.com</a> - Malware site, "Adnxs appeared as the eighth-biggest name in our Tracking the Trackers data."</li></ul><p>If you are not familiar with Pixels/Trackers, take Facebook as an example. You can place a pixel on your website to share your website traffic data with Facebook. Facebook uses this data for better personalized targeting.

But, Disqus places all of these pixels on your website (inside their iframe) without any consent.</p><p>*In 2014, Disqus inserted Viglink affiliate links to their client sites intrusively (<a href="https://poststatus.com/disqus-potentially-adding-affiliate-links-users-content-opted/">Source</a>)</p><p>When you provide a free product, money should come from somewhere. Disqus uses advertising for that. Now, I subscribed to a paid plan trial of Disqus to see if things change or not. No! Even in the paid plans, the same pixels are loaded on the client-side. Looks like there's no way to opt-out from tracking.</p><p>Even I title the article "the dark commenting system", I'm not sure if Disqus is a commenting system.

As "the railrodder", Keaton crosses Canada from east to west on a railway track speeder. True to Keaton's genre, the film is full of sight gags as our protagonist putt-putts his way to British Columbia. Not a word is spoken throughout, and Keaton is as spry and ingenious at fetching laughs as he was in the old days of the silent slapsticks.

                <p>In this post,
I dissect a common misconception about the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute
and I explore its potential impact on Web security.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR <a href="#tldr">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is not well understood.</li>
<li>Conflating <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> is a common but harmful mistake.</li>
<li>The concept of <em>site</em> is more difficult to apprehend than meets the eye.</li>
<li>Some requests are cross-origin but same-site.</li>
<li><code>SameSite</code> is only concerned with cross-site requests.</li>
<li><code>SameSite</code> paints a target on your subdomains' back.</li>
<li>Misguided practitioners may unduly eschew <code>SameSite=Strict</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-advent-of-samesite">The advent of <code>SameSite</code> <a href="#the-advent-of-samesite">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have no doubt heard of the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute</a>.
It made headlines when, in February 2020,
Chrome started rolling out changes to <code>SameSite</code>’s default behaviour;
Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed suit</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>Intended as a defense-in-depth mechanism against cross-site attacks,
such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</a>
and <a href="https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)</a>,
<code>SameSite</code> had been lying dormant at the heart of implementing browsers
since <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its inception in 2016</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/samesite-cookie-changes-in-february.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code>’s activation in early 2020</a>
required labourious adjustments
by some websites to maintain third-party access,
but was widely hailed as a welcome addition to browser defences.
Both in anticipation and in reaction to <code>SameSite</code>’s activation in browsers,
posts started
sprouting on blogs all over the Web to spread the word
about the mechanics of the “new” cookie attribute.</p>
<h2 id="playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">Playing fast and loose with terminology <a href="#playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some of those posts were of admirable precision,
such as <a href="https://twitter.com/rowan_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rowan Merewood</a>’s <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev piece</a>
entitled “SameSite cookies explained”.
Unfortunately, relatively few of the posts about <code>SameSite</code>
went to the effort of clarifying the concept of <em>site</em>,
from which the concepts of <em>same-site request</em> and <em>cross-site request</em>
are of course derived.</p>
<p>Moreover, many posts,
including those produced by influential members of the infosec community,
appeared to use the terms “origin” and “site” interchangeably or, at least,
somewhat loosely.</p>
<p>Back in February 2019, Kristian Bremberg <a href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/02/05/guide-http-security-headers-for-better-web-browser-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote the following</a>
on the venerable Detectify blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SameSite attribute is rather new and provides excellent protection
against CSRF attacks. If a cookie uses the SameSite attribute,
the web browser will make sure that the request made with the cookie came
from the <strong>origin</strong> that sat [sic] the cookie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Infosec superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> himself,
in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seminal post</a> entitled
“Promiscuous Cookies and Their Impending Death via the SameSite Policy”
and published in early January 2020, described the effects of the different
<code>SameSite</code> attribute values as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>None: what Chrome defaults to today without a SameSite value set</li>
<li>Lax: some limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
<li>Strict: tight limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>And a few months later, in an otherwise fascinating <a href="https://blog.reconless.com/samesite-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
analysing how the advent of <code>SameSite</code> was affecting a range of vulnerabilities
cherished by hackers,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xReconless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconless team</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the update, all cookies without an explicit <code>SameSite</code> attribute will
be treated as having <code>SameSite=Lax</code>.
This means <strong>cross-origin</strong> requests no longer carry cookies,
except for top-level navigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p><em>Domain</em>, <em>host</em>, <em>origin</em>, <em>site</em>…
Using those terms loosely in informal communication is natural;
such laxity in the use of terminology can be forgiven,
and if you’ve been guilty of it yourself, you’re in good company.</p>
<h2 id="are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">Are “site” and “origin” interchangeable? <a href="#are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">¶</a></h2>
<p>However, the advent of the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute raises some questions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a careful distinction between “origin” and “site” warranted, here?</li>
<li>Is it just a distinction without a difference?</li>
<li>Is a <em>cross-site</em> request no different from a <em>cross-origin</em> request?</li>
<li>Could the cookie attribute have as well been named “SameOrigin”, then?</li>
<li>Or, if there is indeed a real difference between “site” and “origin”,
does it matter to practitioners?</li>
<li>And, if the difference does matter, how so?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have already guessed the answers from the title of this post:
“site” has a very technical meaning in the context of <code>SameSite</code>,
yet it is unduly neglected;
and the distinction between <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> <em>does</em> matter,
yet the two concepts are frequently conflated.</p>
<p>This lapse in terminology didn’t escape everyone.
That Google’s <em>Developer Advocate of Web</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/agektmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eiji Kitamura</a>
felt the need to dedicate
a whole <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
about the distinction between “origin” and “site”,
only a few months after Chrome activated <code>SameSite</code>, is revealing.</p>
<p>In order to understand why the distinction matters,
you first need to understand the difference between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-origin">What do we mean by “origin”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-origin">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work with Web technologies,
you have at least some familiarity with the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</a>,
arguably one of the main pillar of Web security.
The concept of <em>origin</em> of a URI is of course central to the SOP and,
as such, it is relatively well-understood.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.2 of RFC 6454</a> defines an <em>origin</em> as a triple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly speaking, two URIs are part of the same origin
(i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
scheme, host, and port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The port is optional; if not specified, the default port associated to the scheme
is implied (e.g. 80 for <code>http</code> and 443 for <code>https</code>).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Glossary/Origin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN Web Docs</a> has a series of useful examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-site">What do we mean by “site”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-site">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behind the painfully generic term that is “site”
hides a concept fundamentally more difficult to grasp
than that of <em>origin</em>.
For one thing, the term “site” was not always a technical one:
it predates the SOP and was in in common use
<a href="https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when attacks like cross-site scripting came onto the scene</a>.
Furthermore, the modern concept of <em>site</em> is fraught with technical difficulties.
It is intimately linked to that of a host’s <em>registrable domain</em>,
which the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-registrable-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Living Standard</a> defines as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a domain formed by the most specific public suffix,
along with the domain label immediately preceeding it, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A host’s registrable domain is also known as its “eTLD+1”, short for
“effective top-level domain plus one”.)</p>
<p>In the simplest of cases, <strong>the site of an origin simply corresponds
to the registrable domain (if any) of the origin’s host</strong>.</p>
<p>Two examples, to fix ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site of <code>https://www.example.org</code> is <code>example.org</code>,
because <code>org</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>example.org</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
<li>The site of <code>https://jub0bs.github.io</code> is <code>jub0bs.github.io</code>,
because <code>github.io</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>jub0bs.github.io</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! Perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>github.io</code> is a public suffix</a>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the concept of registrable domain is a fluid one,
because it relies on the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public-Suffix List</a>,
a list which is not set in stone but <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to change over time</a>.
Not to mention that different browsers may not necessarily stay abreast of
changes to the Public-Suffix list at the same pace.</p>
<p>The technicalities do not end there!
As <a href="https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev warns us</a>,
the concept of <em>site</em> is still evolving and
will soon incorporate the scheme also.
The change currently sits behind a flag in Chrome but will soon be rolled out.
However, to sidestep this difficulty and prolong the relevance of this post,
I’ll only consider origins whose scheme is <code>https</code> in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">Same-site vs. cross-site requests <a href="#same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dealt with the concept of <em>site</em>,
we can finally discuss the concepts of <em>same-site</em> and <em>cross-site</em> requests.
A given request is either <em>same-site</em> or <em>cross-site</em>.
Whether a request is same-site or cross-site depends on the comparison
between the sites of the request’s source origin and target origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two sites are identical, the request is said to be <em>same-site</em>;</li>
<li>If the two sites are different, the request is said to be <em>cross-site</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site,
because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.github.io</code>
to <code>https://bar.github.io</code> is cross-site,
because the site of the first origin is <code>foo.github.io</code>,
whereas the site of the second origin is <code>bar.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.bar.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site, because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve made it this far down the present post, I thank you for your patience.
Take heart: the payoff is near!</p>
<h2 id="cross-origin-same-site-requests">Cross-origin, same-site requests <a href="#cross-origin-same-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>All cross-site requests are necessarily cross-origin; that much is clear.
However, as shown by the first and third examples above,
not all cross-origin requests are cross-site.</p>
<p><img src="https://jub0bs.com/images/cor_vs_csr.svg" alt="Venn-diagram"></p>
<p>And the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is only concerned with cross-site requests;
it has no effect on cross-origin requests that happen to be same-site.
This is why the distinction between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em> is important.</p>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo <a href="#online-demo">¶</a></h2>
<p>To prove my point,
I’ve drawn inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt’s post</a> and
I’ve deployed a simple Go server to <code>samesitedemo.jub0bs.com</code> composed
of two simple endpoints.
Endpoint <code>/setcookie</code> sets a <code>SameSite=Strict</code> cookie, like so</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>Set-Cookie: StrictCookie=foo; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict
</span></code></pre></div><p>Endpoint <code>/readcookie</code> prints the cookie (if any) attached to the request.
I’ve also set up two “attacking” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both pages simply consist in a single link to
<code>https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/readcookie</code>.</p>
<p>To fix ideas, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie</a>.
Doing so will set the <code>Strict</code> cookie in your browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the attacking URI (<code>jub0bs.github.io</code>)
is different from that of the target URI (<code>jub0bs.com</code>),
the browser does not attach the cookie to the request resulting from
following the link, and no cookie gets printed in the response.
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as expected, and the “attack” is foiled.</li>
<li>Now navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a>
and follow the link on that page.

<p><strong>Notes Taken: 2021-01-28</strong></p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0">GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Martin explains there are several different understandings of what Event-Driven Architecture is. All of these are valid but are distinct in their actual form. Martin delves into four of these.</p>
<p>At a high level, there is a difference between events and commands.
Events explain, 'something <strong>has</strong> happened', the receiver is free to ignore the event or do something in response to the event occurring.
Commands explain, 'something <strong>should</strong> happen', the producer of the command has to know what command to issue.
Events and commands are both valid, the disadvantage of commands is that the producer has to know which system wants to react to a command, and the producer must issue the appropriate command - arguably this creates more coupling.</p>
<p>The four patterns of Event-Driven Architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Notification</li>
<li>Event Carried State Transfer</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pattern-1-event-notification">Pattern 1: Event Notification</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=200s">Timecode - 3:20</a></p>
<p>Martin pictures a system where a user changes their address in the <strong>Customer Management System</strong>, this should cause the&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Quoting System</strong> to calculate a new quote for the customer. In a classic model, the customer management system must call out to the Insurance Quoting System to order a requote. This creates a strong coupling, in particular the Customer Management System is dependent on the Insurance Quoting System. This is likely suboptimal as the Insurance Quoting System is a more specialised and less general system than the Customer Management System; Martin argues dependencies should usually be drawn from specialised systems to more general systems. Instead of calling from the Customer Management System to the Insurance Quoting System, the Customer Management System could publish an event 'CustomerAddressChange' to a queue, and the Insurance Quoting System could listen for these events and requote the customer when it receives the event. This effectively alters a coupling of&nbsp;'<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Insurance Quoting System</em>' into&nbsp;<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Event Queue &lt;- Insurance Quoting System</em>.
This is the most basic of event architectures, it simply alters the way dependencies can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-2-event-carried-state-transfer">Pattern 2: Event Carried State Transfer</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=893s">Timecode - 14:53</a></p>
<p>A less common pattern. Built atop Event Notification, when we receive an event, we pull the data from the Customer Management System and store the relevant parts in our own database. This means the Insurance Quoting System can stay available, even when the Customer Management System goes down. The problem is we now have to copies of data so we lose consistency.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-3-event-sourcing">Pattern 3: Event Sourcing</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=1251s">Timecode - 20:51</a></p>
<p>The previous two patterns are largely still CRUD, when we make a change, we save it to a database,&nbsp;<strong>overwriting</strong> the previous value and maybe publishing an event.
Event Sourcing changes this, we both overwrite the current state but we also log an event to an event log.
We now have a system with two forms of state, the <strong>application state</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The application state is the point in time state, which can be recovered from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The standard for an event sourcing system, is that at any point in time the application state can be destroyed and we can&nbsp;<strong>reliably recover</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
In Event Sourcing, we move from being oriented around application state, with events as an optional extra, to being oriented around a log of all events, with application state derived from that log.</p>
<p>Developers are constantly using an example of an event sourcing program, almost all vcs systems such as git are event sourced.
The current commit/working state is the application state, and branches, commits, etc are all just events in the event log.
For business people, an accounting system makes for a good analogy to an event sourced system.
The current balance of accounts is the application state, but the series of entries in the ledger is the set of events that are used to construct that state.</p>
<p>One great benefit of Event Sourcing is that we can change the models of application state at any time, and fully reconstruct from our event log. Instead of writing database migrations when data models change, like we do in the SQL world, we just change how state is derived from events. We can even test systems in a read only mode against production, by reading the event log to construct a new application state. One key advantage Martin mentions is that Event Sourcing enables a 'Memory Image'. This essentially means that our application state can be completely ephemeral, and in memory; you don't need a database for application state, you only need to read from the event log and construct the application state in memory. This can be very fast and performant. The other benefit of this is that memory is super fast, and you can essentially avoid database calls, whilst having persistence. Martin mentions, think about the opportunities opening up here as we begin to see more and more systems with high amounts of RAM or super fast non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p>There are added complexities. Consider how you can order events reliably. Consider how you ensure transactional guarantees, if you write to the event log, you must also update the application state at the same time. You can't update application state before writing to the event log because then you have a working state that is ahead of the event log state, and remember, the event log state is the source of truth. Event Sourcing systems generally bring asynchrony with them, and this can add quite a bit of complexity. You must also consider consistency, what does it mean to write to the event log, if other systems are going to react to those events, they will not be consistent at the point of time you write to the event log. This is a trade off with all event driven architectures however.</p>
<p>Martin mentions in passing that he is very surprised by how uncommon Event Sourcing is in practice.</p>
<p>Martin brings forward a final and very important consideration when Event Sourcing. We must carefully consider which events are worth storing, and which are not. Suppose there is a service that receives an order to 'buy 15 widgets', the service then creates a transaction that is stored in the application state, this transaction contains additional info like the tax applied and any discounts applied. The service could persist an event with the business logic derived details, such as tax and discounts, or an event that most closely mirrors the input request. The advantage of the former is that the event log contains a more precise record of what was computed at the time the request was received, the advantage with the latter is that it contains only the bare minimum required to recompute the application state, and nothing more. In practice, many systems persist both types of events. Greg Young says that there should be no business logic between your events and your application state.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-4-command-query-responsibility-segregation">Pattern 4: Command Query Responsibility Segregation</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=2611s">Timecode - 43:31</a></p>
<p>Martin warns outright, this is a complex pattern that is more often than not implemented incorrectly, and can cause troubles if so. The idea here is to separate out the write (command) path from the read (query) path of your system. This is particularly useful when you have an application that is read from much more frequently than it is read from, especially if the reads are of a form derived from the write form.</p>

<section id=""><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Bathed in light, the world remains our first and last love.” —Albert Camus</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone writing seriously about utopia in September of 2020 will seem—to be charitable—a little disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>The American West is burning. The Arctic is melting. Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Nearly a million people have died from the coronavirus. Economic inequality continues to grow, only accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>If there’s anything like a road to utopia—if we can even begin to entertain such an idea—we don’t seem to be on it. The belief that society’s problems can be solved seems ridiculous when each day brings fresh horrors. Our collective failure to make so much as a dent on climate change, the cancerous spread of polarizing misinformation with its fracturing of society, and the irretrievable damage we are inflicting on the biosphere, only deepen a sense that the best we can hope for now is adaptation and survival in an environment increasingly hostile (physically, psychologically, spiritually) to the individual.</p>
<p>But hope, as “Mad” Max Rockatansky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN4sboc7E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us from the other side of collapse</a>, is a mistake, and despair paralyzes. What we need are viable alternatives. Alternatives that go beyond bolt-on fixes to broken systems. Alternatives we can imagine living—and thriving—in. And most importantly, alternatives we can look for in our present and in our past, not in some idealized future.</p>
<p>Utopia is in the air again, though few dare call it by that name. Ideas that would be dismissed just a few short years ago as “utopian”—a word that has been cut down to pejorative status—are entering into the mainstream. Political programs like the Green New Deal promise solutions that could spare us from the worst effects of climate change while stimulating the economy. Universal Basic Income and its brethren suggest how we might mend broken social safety nets and ease economic inequality. But what we lack, and urgently need, is a vision of the world we want to bring into being. That’s all utopianism is: the audacity to imagine the world we want, and then living as though that world were possible.</p>
<p>Metals become malleable when subjected to heat. In higher temperatures, they melt, making it possible to cast existing forms into new shapes. Culture I/O is premised on a belief that under certain conditions, the malleability of our society increases as well. The coming decade, more than any other in recent memory, will be turbulent and heated. In the words of Arundhati Roy: <em>“We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</em> </p>

<p>A guide to utopia has to start with a foundation of all the concepts feeding into it: ourselves, nature, technology, society, and the other Big Things. It’s easier to go on a journey together if we all leave from the same place.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A society consists of individuals. Only individuals suffer, experience joy, love, longing, pleasure, pain, act with intent, die. They can do so collectively, but always and only as individuals. <strong>In the end, only individuals matter.</strong></li>
<li>This is an ontological position, not a value judgement. A family or society exists only insofar as its individual members exist.</li>
<li>Because of this, we should reject any ideology that stresses the primacy of a group at the expense of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, we should reject any ideology that places a system (such as markets) above individuals.</li>
<li>This should not be taken as an endorsement of individualism. Individuals do not exist in isolation. The point is simply that we should always treat individuals as <em>ends</em>, never as <em>means</em>.</li>
<li>Humans are complex, emotional, self-aware animals with a degree of free will—not rational agents, logic machines, or biological algorithms.</li>
<li>Humans are not the only complex, emotional, self-aware animals on this planet.</li>
<li>The quickest path to dooming any human undertaking is to assume that we can become, or even reliably pretend to be, anything other than what we are—both at our best and at our worst.</li>

<section id="minds"><div><h3><span>2. Minds</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Use your head, can’t you, use your head, you’re on earth, there’s no cure for that!” —Samuel Beckett</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The human brain is the most mysterious and versatile physical structure in the known world. We know more about how the universe came to be than how the brain works.</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between brain, mind, and consciousness is the greatest scientific question of our time.</li>
<li>Though we are emotional creatures first and foremost, we are wired for reason. Using only his mind and some crude observations, Aristarchus of the Greek island of Samos figured out that the Earth orbits the Sun almost 2,000 years before this became accepted fact. Einstein produced four of his groundbreaking papers in one year spent hunched over a desk in a musty Bern patent office, with reason as his only instrument.</li>
<li>In spite of these impressive abilities, we are extremely susceptible to biases and fallacies in our thinking—and to those who would exploit these biases.</li>
<li>The either/or fallacy is one of the most pernicious of these errors, passed down to us by Aristotle. It suggests that everything must be either this, or that. Good or bad. Nature or nurture. Introvert or extrovert. Liberal or conservative. It is the binary logic of machines applied to an analog world full of semantic nuance, contradiction, and mystery. If we are, on a species-level, in trouble, it is in large part because of our inability to internalize the fact that multiple ideas which seem opposed to each other can simultaneously be true.</li>
<li>This does not mean that truth is relative. It isn’t. Only that out in the world, truth is more complicated than it seems. If we simplify the world in order to function in it, we do so at our peril.</li>

<section id="language"><div><h3><span>3. Language</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“The map is not the territory.” —Alfred Korzybski</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Words are not reality—they represent abstractions that allow us to make sense of reality, to think and talk about it.</li>
<li>This is important because it means that words do not and cannot map perfectly to reality, and that different languages—systems of words—can reflect reality in subtly different ways.</li>
<li>Words matter. Words and mind are inextricably linked and together they create the feedback loop that makes reasoning possible.</li>
<li>The abuse of language is a form of psychological abuse. George Orwell memorably took it to task in <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Politics and the English Language</em></a> three quarters of a century ago, but we’ve been at it for much, much longer. What is new is the degree to which words have saturated our lives. Social media and 24 hour news have made it impossible to escape.</li>
<li>Precision and clarity are how we push back against the abuse of language. Because we use words to think, choosing them with care leads to clearer arguments and thoughts. We should always strive to practice good linguistic hygiene, and to use language in good faith—for our own sanity, if nothing else.</li>
<li>Where pushing back is impossible, we must step away. Silence can be a virtue.</li>
<li>The only way to have a productive discussion involving abstractions (democracy, justice, utopia) is to clearly and rigorously define them first. Often we’ll find that the discussion ends up fixating on the definitions of the words themselves. This is a good thing.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>Google technical recruiter Jeremy Ong and colleague Lizi Lopez created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE">video</a> providing Google’s advice for resumes, both technical and non-technical. At Leet Resumes, we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, so we thought we’d share and compare Google’s advice with our own, show where they mostly line up, and show where your resume needs to appeal to employers beyond Google. Given our focus, we’ll concentrate on how this advice applies to experienced technical or engineering professionals.</p><p>With three exceptions, the Google recruiters’ advice matches up with Leet Resumes’ advice, and I’ll explain why their advice is so very accurate, and also where we differ and why (the Google way is not everybody’s way). Further, we explain our design choices in detail in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/41QpzF22JQx1YWrqtbdI56bA9Tp4VDHJlk6zX3z0Zk1T3PfU-chPyOcDFcCefMOOOIdxjJZOkOktgrpXBtUiitjiiluKsA7BSY0BeOOaccP_D8jWO6hndjFKtUOJDzUojsL0-dCp" alt="Google's resume advice"></p><p>First off, Jeremy and Lizi advise, “Make sure the format is simple and consistent in design, font, sizing, and spacing throughout so that the person reviewing your resume can easily scan and find information quickly.”</p><p>This sounds like obvious advice, but many engineers complicate their resumes with colors, columns, graphics, multiple fonts, font colors, and font sizes, that they put a tremendous burden on the people reading their resumes. Simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tv3HpXghtb62OxzGg0kDxdHB9icAzEmefiNvqiu-oRsy-rqXTshmq0a-Bn0L0Ll-mIf-Uxa1EYNyvVHmB2-m0UH-iw3_HaIh_9CNwBbJU-_LWRqK8tuKpdVWcX7Sw98F6Isrndrk" alt="Google's Resume Basics"></p><p>They continue, “Include your contact information and email at the top. You don't have to include objective statements [or] references. Use bullet points with consistent formatting and structure throughout the resume rather than long paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Keep your resume to… no longer than two pages for engineering roles. And perhaps the most important tip we have overall is to always check for typos.”</p><p>We agree with all of this advice at Leet. Bullet points and quick, scannable text are far superior to long paragraphs. It’s how readers ingest resumes in 2021.</p><p>On resume length, in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>, we advise 1 page for those with 10 years’ or fewer experience, and 2 pages for those with 10 or more years of experience.</p><p>Typos might seem like a small matter, but many engineering managers have learned that engineers who aren’t careful with their resumes, also aren’t careful with their code. Be smart about it and check very carefully.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VFrSANgZ36uEfJ41lzjU8mNBtKwQW9i1lYqONH1QTq51yYw94r6TauDAjsjnJr2QPOZXPeiZTdrHRBrUcjR2NdBvusvD6rDQukbbOElz7FxaIiYwJaMRBtVMIPhZqDEK625_R2hs" alt="Google Resume Basics: Lengths"></p><p>Lizi and Jeremy continue, “It's also critical you list your GitHub profile or other prominent open source work that shows us you're contributing to the open source community, passionate about the work you're doing, and looking to improve your skills.”</p><p>We agree that your Github link should be in your contact information, and that your LinkedIn (which is a subset of your resume info, and therefore extraneous) should not be.</p><p>Jeremy and Lizi further comment that, “Experience should take up the bulk of your resume.”</p><p>Another obvious point, perhaps, but the most popular formats online, including those at the top of Google search results for software engineering resume template, break this good advice. These complex formats often push the experience section into as little as 25% of the available surface area of a resume. Again, simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P5XdrU6yP7ny6VNex_pCz7s3iuLbHuWZFfzvhB9of3mF_LKl9WN4jBKO7wuYoJ8wiMa8KHg8we-irDUWmE0EvBPPCAOZ471Dk7ITzqIttWRxc2n_4J-pZZk0FQcIWNxkXd3h5KVL" alt="Google Resume Advice: Experience"></p><p>The Google duo share: “List everything in reverse chronological order with your most recent experience first. Include your employer, position, and dates employed for all jobs… in the month-year format. Keep your bullet point descriptions concise and clear, and make the most of your space by streamlining bullet points that spill over onto the next line by only one or two words.”</p><p>Again, we agree and the resumes we write for experienced engineers follow these same guidelines. Concise and clear is usually a problem for engineers writing their own resumes, and that’s where Leet can be a big help in cutting out words, phrases, and even whole bullets that don’t advance your story.</p><p>“For each bullet, use action words like created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed, and so on, so the person reading your resume can easily and quickly understand your skills and experience.”</p><p>At Leet, we go further and suggest that you use success verbs - verbs that show how your work created successes - rather than simply using verbs such as managed or developed, which are more focused on duties and responsibilities instead of outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yXV2gqPytpBnWWAETYkNC0dIysQ4DTUjMzKtasBMyzvIlwAVR_aXM_EVUmNAcLNpXQFJZRlxihRFc91s9HK2o3Zg1exQ9cESP6hEzXFdIUrnSLrggUNPCi74z5QVMTcgJMnU1vHk" alt="null"></p><p>“It's important to focus on the results and impact of your work, so list metrics and examples concisely rather than writing long descriptions. We value data at Google and want to see you know how to apply it when speaking to your accomplishments. Use data and comparisons or averages to provide context.</p><p>“To ensure you focus on results and impact in this section, we recommend using this helpful framework – accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z.”</p><p>Google is exactly right on this advice - use data, numbers, and metrics, to explain your results. Instead of writing that you reduced page load time, write that you reduced page load time from 700 ms to 322 ms. Numbers make your accomplishments seem more real, and are more persuasive.</p><p>Lizi continues, “Let's walk through a few examples for different types of experience.”</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rGmPHOn7Y7NP4NGMbiRYaRw0uhuUtNJ0Pas5lVfhUyu_2jzHHj5g355j45sLsvwepTZRJk52Fb1jIlTfeKxWN0L5g2Uxlfb7TSzSBMR-47glDip-Yn6w-WRp5nKq1C4Fcsb49RTD" alt="Googel Metrics on your resume"></p><p>“If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, this example should be particularly helpful… ‘Increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring API.’</p><p>“This concisely conveys the impact backed up by data and communicates a skill. In this case, it's restructuring an API, but it could be an experience like adding new hardware, algorithmic improvements, caching answers, or implementing machine learning.”</p><p>Three cheers for Google on making this point so effectively.&nbsp; <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume%C2%A0">Your technical resume should include numbers</a>.</p><p>A few more good points from the Google folks before we get into our disagreements.</p><p>“Include any relevant leadership positions, awards, university honors, scholarships, or other types of recognition.”</p><p>Remember, recognition indicates that someone else thought you were good, worthy, and successful. Including these external validations help show that your career progress is already endorsed by others - a good sign for a future boss.</p><p>And they also mention, “If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, be sure to include the programming language you used in bold for each project you include.”</p><p>This is advice unique to Google, and I feel more targeted towards junior engineers, for whom the particular language experience is important in hiring. The further you rise in your engineering career, the more the specifics of language choice and deployment fall away, and the bigger architectural issues come to predominate in any assessment of your capabilities.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve agreed with everything Google has to say, right? They’re flawless, right? Well, not quite. There are a few bits of advice that aren’t effective for candidates who are not applying to Google. Specifically:</p><p>“PDF formatting is preferred.”</p><p>As I’ve shared in my <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/resume-parser-ceos-advice-for-your-resume%C2%A0">mega-interview with the CEOs and technical experts at resume parsing</a> companies, PDFs can sometimes render in a graphical format that evade the comprehension of companies’ HR systems.&nbsp; MS Word, Google Docs, or even .txt should be preferred over PDF.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h_35s4QCEIIqyHzXasPCxCgdxtH55imC75BRzAa2zNi5pSD7NKiSp_JQA7smxG10Ollge5rr7Gibcckbo6ubCzspbUVqr91HCEq_fGKVRFGxFJsruYYUR66-xqy_2lEzwOoA3-SS" alt="null"></p><p>“List your programming languages at the top of your resume and make sure you're comfortable interviewing in them.”</p><p>In contrast to most other technical resume advice, Google suggests putting your programming languages at the top of your resume. I honestly don’t see how this advice can be realistic for most experienced programmers, and Leet Resumes places your technologies at the bottom of your resume.</p><p>To take just two examples, here are the technologies listed by two Leet Resumes users today:</p><p><u>Example 1</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Java</p><p>Frameworks/Libraries: Express, NestJS, React, Redux, Cypress, Jest, Selenium, ReactNative, Node.js</p><p><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose</p><p><strong>Certification:</strong> Certified Scrum Master</p><p><u>Example 2</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Terraform, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Bash, CSS</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> AWS Services, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Postgres, Camunda (BPM Engine), Gradle, Maven</p><p><strong>Libraries/Frameworks:</strong> SQLAlchemy, boto3, JUnit, Pytest, Spring/Spring Boot</p><p><strong>Other:</strong> Node.js, SocketCluster, REST APIs, Dreamfactory</p><p>It does not seem possible or realistic that either of these technology professionals could fit their technologies at the top of their resume without breaking the important formatting conventions that both Leet and Google advocate regarding placement of work experience and professional summary.</p><p>And finally, their advice to customize your resume per job simply isn’t accurate, “A big tip here is to read the job description and look at the language it uses. Writing a resume for a specific job description takes a little bit of effort, but it can really help your application stand out. You can even bold and italicize keywords related to the job description to highlight your relevant skills and experience.”</p><p>As with all users, there is a difference between what technical recruiters believe they do, and what they actually do. Given the amount of time spent in reviewing a resume, only the absolutely most relevant keywords are considered - perhaps 2 or 3, sometimes as many as 6.&nbsp; But never, ever dozens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Your Leet resume will list all of the technologies in which you are proficient, and all of your major accomplishments. So if your well-constructed, thorough, thought-through resume doesn’t already have those 2-6 keywords on it, are you really a fit for the job?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s simply unlikely that your primary resume is truly missing a critical keyword that can be added to a secondary resume to catch a recruiter’s eye, and there is therefore no need to customize multiple resumes with keywords.</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this review of the advice Google recruiters have for your technical resume. If you’d like Leet to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">write your technical resume for free,</a> please sign up.&nbsp; You can also read the stories of other engineers - there’s a reason we can say users love us!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p><b>Scientists from Alfred Wegener Institute: “We need to have a fresh look at the role of the Arctic Ocean.”</b></p>
		

		<p><span>[03. February 2021]&nbsp;</span>
			
			
				<b><p>The Arctic Ocean was covered by up to 900 m thick shelf ice and was filled entirely with freshwater at least twice in the last 150,000 years. This surprising finding, reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature, is the result of long-term research by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute and the MARUM. With a detailed analysis of the composition of marine deposits, the scientists could demonstrate that the Arctic Ocean as well as the Nordic Seas did not contain sea-salt in at least two glacial periods. Instead, these oceans were filled with large amounts of freshwater under a thick ice sheet. This water could then be released into the North Atlantic in very short periods of time. Such sudden freshwater inputs could explain rapid climate oscillations for which no satisfying explanation had been previously found.</p></b>

			<p>About 60.000 to 70.000 years ago, in a particularly cold part of the last glacial period, large parts of Northern Europe and North America were covered by ice sheets. The European ice sheet spanned a distance of more than 5000 kilometres, from Ireland and Scotland via Scandinavia to the Eastern rim of the Kara Sea (Arctic Ocean). In North America, large parts of what is now known as Canada were buried under two large ice sheets. Greenland and parts of the Bering Sea coastline were glaciated too. What was the ice situation like even further North, in the Arctic Ocean? Was it covered by thick sea-ice, or maybe with the tongues of these vast ice sheets were floating on it, far beyond the North Pole?</p>
<p>Scientific answers to these questions were more or less hypothetical so far. In contrast to deposits on land, where erratic boulders, moraines and glacial valleys are the obvious landmarks of glaciers, only few traces of vast ice shelves had been found so far in the Arctic Ocean. Geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have now compiled existing evidence from the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, and combined it with new data to arrive at a surprising conclusion.</p>
<p>According to their study, the floating parts of the northern ice sheets covered large parts of the Arctic Ocean in the past 150,000 years. Once about 70,000-60,000 years ago and also about 150,000-130,000 years ago. In both periods, freshwater accumulated under the ice, creating a completely fresh Arctic Ocean for thousands of years.</p>

			<p>“These results mean a real change to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean in glacial climates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete freshening of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas has been considered - happening not just once, but twice,” says the first author, Dr Walter Geibert, geochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute.</p>

			<h3><span>Thorium is absent in the sediments, so saline water must have been absent</span></h3>
<p>Their finding is based on geological analyses of ten sediment cores from different parts of the Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas. The stacked deposits mirror the climate history of the past glacials. When investigating and comparing the sediment records, the geoscientists found that an important indicator was missing, always in the same two intervals. “In saline sea water, the decay of naturally occurring uranium always results in the production of the isotope thorium-230. This substance accumulates at the sea floor, where it remains detectable for a very long time due to its half-life of 75,000 years,” Walter Geibert explains.</p>
<p>Therefore, geologists often use this thorium-isotope as a natural clock. “Here, its repeated and wide-spread absence is the giveaway that reveals to us what happened. According to our knowledge, the only reasonable explanation for this pattern is that the Arctic Ocean was filled with freshwater twice in its younger history- in frozen and liquid form,” co-author and micropalaeontologist Dr Jutta Wollenburg, also from the AWI, explains. &nbsp;</p>

<p>How can a large ocean basin, connected by several straits with the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, turn entirely fresh? “Such a scenario is perceivable if we realize that in glacial periods, global sea levels were up to 130 m lower than today, and ice masses in the Arctic may have restricted ocean circulation even further,” states co-author Professor Ruediger Stein, geologist at the AWI and the MARUM.</p>
<p>Shallow connections like Bering Strait or the sounds of the Canadian Archipelago were above sea level at the time, cutting off the connection with the Pacific Ocean entirely. In the Nordic Seas, large icebergs or ice sheets extending onto the sea floor restricted the exchange of water masses. The flow of glaciers, ice melt in summer, and rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean kept delivering large amounts of fresh water to the system, at least 1200 cubic kilometres per year. A part of this amount would have been forced via the Nordic Seas through the sparse narrow deeper connections in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic, hindering saline water from penetrating further north. This resulted in the freshening of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

			<p>“Once the mechanism of ice barriers failed, heavier saline water could fill the Arctic Ocean again,” Walter Geibert says. “We believe that it could then quickly displace the lighter freshwater, resulting in a sudden discharge of the accumulated amount of freshwater over the shallow southern boundary of the Nordic Seas, the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge, into the North Atlantic.”</p>
<p>A concept that assumes that enormous amounts of freshwater were stored in the Arctic Ocean and available for rapid release would help understanding the connection between a range of past climate fluctuations. It would also offer an explanation for some apparent discrepancies between different ways of reconstructing past sea levels. “The remains of coral reefs have pointed to a somewhat higher sea level in certain cold periods than reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores, or reconstructions from the calcareous shells of small marine organisms, would suggest,” explains Walter Geibert. “If we now accept that freshwater may not only have been stored in solid form on land, but some of it also in liquid form in the ocean, the different sea level reconstructions agree better and we can reconcile the location of the coral reefs with calculations of the freshwater budget.”</p>
<p>Freshwater release from the Arctic Ocean might also serve as an explanation for some abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period. &nbsp;During such events, temperatures in Greenland could rise by 8-10 degree centigrade within a few years, only returning to the original cold glacial temperatures over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. “We see an example here of a past Arctic climate tipping point of the Earth system. Now we need to investigate in more detail how these processes were interconnected, and evaluate how this new concept of the Arctic Ocean helps in closing further gaps in our knowledge, in particular in view of the risks of manmade climate change,” says Walter Geibert.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building Ditto, we've gotten the chance to talk to 200+ teams about what the process of collaborating on copy looks like for them.</p><p>Our key finding? Copy is end-to-end — it exists from the early phases of discovery and design all the way to development.</p><p>This means that working on copy doesn't just involve writers drafting text on their own. It's the back-and-forth between designers and writers about how copy and visuals can work together. It's conversations with PMs to understand the goals of a new feature and what language will help users navigate successfully. It's working with legal to get a particular term approved for use, or talking to brand about how to name a new feature. It's getting copy translated and following up to fix phrases that are too long in another language. It's handing copy off to developers and making sure it gets into production error-free. It's developers sifting through hardcoded strings when copy already in production needs to get updated.</p><p>In other words, the process of getting copy written and in front of users relies on a <em>lot</em> of people.</p><p>On most teams, though, this process is still fragmented and unreliable. And though we're seeing companies realize how impactful copy is on user experience and business goals, most still have a long way to go in embedding copy into their product development workflows.</p><p>In almost all of our conversations, we heard the same challenges come up:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>How do we integrate copy into the design process?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we manage stakeholder feedback and review of copy?</strong></li><li><strong>What's the best way to hand copy off to developers?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we establish lasting copy consistency across our product?</strong></li></ol><p>In this post, we're sharing what we've learned about the state of copy workflows from our conversations: the issues that teams are currently facing and strategies they've come up with for tackling them.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>1. Integrating copy into the design process</p>
</div><p>Copy is as much a part of the user experience as the layout and the visuals. But translating this into your product development process — making sure that copy and visual design evolve together — is tricky. Visuals often get prioritized over copy, and some words inevitably end up getting written last-minute, in a mad dash to replace lingering <em>lorem ipsums.</em></p><p>Part of the reason is that design and copy often don't share a toolset. Designers work in their design tools, but copy can exist in any number of places (think: external copy docs and spreadsheets, design tools, Jira, Slack, email). Between the annotated screenshots being messaged back-and-forth in Slack and copy tables in word documents, copy ends up increasingly detached from its goal of designing for users.<br>‍</p><p><strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>From our conversations, we've learned a few tips for fostering more effective copy-design collaboration:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Think about copy early on.</strong> Copy is an integral part of the user experience and should be part of the decision-making process from the start. This means thinking about copy even when the design problem is still being framed and user goals are still being established. Copy is more than just the words that eventually end up in the design. Understanding what content a user needs to feel reassured or successfully complete a task can inform the structure of a user flow or even highlight UI issues.<br>In practice, this can look like a few different things: Try designing with real content from the very beginning, and consider mapping out the flow and structure of copy <em>before</em> you start on the visuals. If your company has a dedicated content team, make sure they're kept in the loop on upcoming projects, whether that means inviting them to meetings or sending over post-kickoff notes.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Take an overhead view on copy.</strong> As with visual design, successful copy requires thinking about the product as a whole. Consider how the text in one part of the product will interact with copy that already exists elsewhere. Think about how copy for a particular feature fits into the overarching journey of what else a user is reading and experiencing. See if you can reuse copy (more on this below!) to maintain consistency and overall usability across surfaces of the product.</li><li><strong>Make sure the mockups have up-to-date copy.</strong> This ensures that the text and visuals on a design are continuously aligned.</li></ul><p>For teams with dedicated content roles like UX writers and content designers:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Try using collaborative design tools (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.).</strong> Writers will be able to work side-by-side with designers, edit directly in the mockups, try out variations, and view changes in realtime. Just make sure to establish a clear process for how writers should work out of the design files. For example, if a mockup is particularly complex, this could mean creating a separate page in the file just for writers to play around with copy.</li><li><strong>Define a method for giving status updates</strong>. If writers are working directly out of the design file, it can be tricky to know what copy is final and what's not. Try indicating status in the file itself (ex: colored badges), or deciding on one communication tool like Slack.</li><li><strong>Determine what level of content work each project requires.</strong> While copy is important on every project, it'll be more important on some than others. Chances are, content designers will be supporting many teams at once, so prioritization is key. For writers, establish a process for receiving requests for copy help (we've heard Airtable or Google Forms work well!), and feel free to push back on "quick" requests when you don't have the bandwidth. Try building up a database of reusable text (more on this below) so designers can self-serve.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><div><p>2. Managing stakeholder feedback and review</p>
</div><p>Part of what makes collaborating on copy challenging is the number of stakeholders involved — almost every role at a company, from writers and designers to engineers, PMs, and legal, can touch the copy during any one project.</p><p>Compared to traditional content marketing workflows, product copy review is less linear and more iterative, relying on back-and-forth discussions more than explicit approvals. While compliance and brand teams may give one-and-done responses, folks like product owners and engineers are much more likely to give ongoing feedback as the design evolves.</p><p>Even more, every project involves different stakeholders who each have a set of tools they're comfortable with. For every team we talked to, copy review took place in some combination of the following places:</p><ul role="list"><li>Design tools (ex: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Abstract)</li><li>Spreadsheets and documents (ex: Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable)</li><li>Communication tools (ex: Slack, email)</li><li>Project management tools (ex: Jira, Trello, Confluence)</li><li>Codebase + code management tools (ex: Github, Bitbucket)</li></ul><p>When some comments are added to Google Docs and others to an email thread, and the copy in mockups differs from that in the spreadsheet, stakeholders don't know where to find the most recent discussions or even version of copy. Tool overload makes it difficult to find alignment and make decisions, ultimately slowing the entire team down.</p><p>Beyond setting up a repeatable process for getting feedback, there are also challenges with getting the right feedback at the right time. Stakeholders (who usually aren't involved from the very beginning of the project) have to get up-to-speed on context — what this copy looks like in the design, where it sits in the UX flow, what the overarching project business and user goals are. Stakeholders also often have the mentality that "anyone can write," which can lead to unsolicited suggestions or unproductive feedback loops.</p><p><strong><br>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are a few ways we've heard teams combat these issues:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Designate a single source of truth for all the copy in your project, and enforce that!</strong> Make sure it's kept up-to-date with the latest copy so everyone can stay on the same page. Limit all copy-related discussion to this source of truth, and make sure it's easily accessible by stakeholders. It should also allow you to easily track progress, record iterations, and document who's making changes and the rationale behind those decisions.</li><li><strong>Ensure stakeholders get the context they need off-the-bat.</strong> This could mean linking documentation in the request for review, hopping on a brief call to fill them in, or recording a video walkthrough of the flow. Whenever possible, present copy with visual context. It can also be helpful include what stage the copy is at (was it just drafted, or has it already been rewritten and reviewed by three other teams?) so you get the correct level of feedback.</li><li><strong>Build up relationships with stakeholders</strong>. Sync regularly with key stakeholders, and start to understand their challenges and definitions of success. Look for shared goals and opportunities to advocate for copy and its impact on business and user experience across different parts of the company. Whenever possible, measure copy ROI, tie those to business outcomes, and share those wins so stakeholders are more likely to give copy a seat at the table.</li></ul><p>👉 <em>At Ditto, we're helping teams </em><a href="http://bit.ly/ditto-workflow-single-source" target="_blank"><em>create a single source of truth</em></a><em> for all of their product copy.</em></p><p>‍</p><div><p>3. Handing copy off to developers</p>
</div><p>For all the work that goes into designing and reviewing copy, dealing with copy in production can be equally as challenging.</p><p>Several issues that came up repeatedly:</p><ul role="list"><li>developers don't know when copy is finalized, or even where to find the latest copy,</li><li>developers have to copy and paste text from the copy doc/mockup/other tool, which is time-consuming and error-prone,</li><li>if copy is hardcoded, even small copy changes require developers to hunt down strings down, which diverts them from more impactful work and makes it hard to rapidly change copy or do A/B tests,</li><li>copy often goes un-QA'd, resulting in costly post-production fixes,</li><li>localization involves a whole other set of people, tools, and processes that must also integrate with development.</li></ul><p>‍<br>‍<strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are strategies we heard for getting copy into production more efficiently:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Establish a clear process for communicating when copy has been finalized.</strong> This was by …</li></ul></div></div>

      <article>
      

<p>Let me ask you a question: How much value do you think your source code has?</p>

<p>To answer this question, let me take you a few years back, when I worked with a small high tech startup. We were working on a pretty complex augmented reality system spanning all layers from low-level computer vision components to cross-platform mobile and web apps. Especially for the lower-level components, a good amount of research had been involved. We worked closely with an academic institute that specialized in computer vision.</p>

<p>In short, this project wasn’t something that anybody could just easily recreate. So one of the assumptions we had implicitly made was that our source code was one of the company’s major assets.</p>

<p>When we hired a new COO, who had mainly worked at bigger companies before, he was shocked to hear that all our code, communication infrastructure and internal systems were living in the cloud. He argued that we should move to on-premise solutions as soon as possible, partially out of fear of intellectual property theft, partially to appease investors with similar fears.</p>

<p>While I had no say in it, his arguments seemed somewhat unreasonable to me at the time and I couldn’t put my finger on it. But the CTO was on board. So we installed a cheapo server in one of our office’s closets, even though someone had just broken into our building earlier that month. We got rid of GitLab, and moved away from Slack and Trello in favor of an on-prem Jira installation. The whole ordeal took months to complete, and I’m guessing that all things considered, it cost the small company of ~6 people about half a year of development time. There was also the ongoing opportunity cost of no longer being able to use any new tools that involved the cloud.</p>

<p>But the whole thing got me thinking about an interesting question: What would happen if someone just took all our code? Going even further, what would happen if we ourselves just put it all on GitHub, with a permissive license like MIT? Short of making investors think we’re crazy, what direct impact would that have had on the company?</p>

<p>I thought long and hard about these questions, and I think in our situation back then, the answer would have been: absolutely none.</p>

<h2 id="your-source-code-is-worthless">Your source code is worthless</h2>

<p>Let’s face it, we were still a fast-moving startup, even if the above anecdote might give you the opposite picture. Our code was still changing drastically every couple weeks. Changes of the entire architecture or complete re-writes of components were not uncommon, as is usual for some early stage startups. And as you might expect in such a situation, the code wasn’t of the highest quality either: Half the time, the build would be broken. Testing and documentation were basically non-existent. It was unlikely that anyone from outside the team would even have gotten the thing up and running. Even if they did, it would be outdated a moment later.</p>

<p>One of the fears from management was that a big company like Google could take our code and build a competing service. After thinking about this in more detail, the idea now seems laughable to me: They would be much faster just building it themselves from scratch, than trying to understand the crummy code we had hacked together.</p>

<p>But let’s take a step back and assume the opposite for a moment: Beautifully written, clean code with complete test coverage. One-click build process. Exceptionally well-written documentation of the architecture and components. Would this have changed the situation? I really don’t think it would have.</p>

<p>You see, in 2017, there actually was an incident of a high profile source code theft: Panic, a company that makes high quality Mac and iOS software, had the full source code for most of their apps <a href="https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code" target="_blank">stolen by hackers</a>. While the attackers demanded a ransom to prevent the public release of the code, Panic refused to pay. They came to the conclusion that the worst thing that could happen would be people building cracked versions of their Apps, full of malware. But that was already happening anyways (as with most software), even before the source code was stolen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure this was a pretty bad blow for Panic, and I’m in no way arguing that source code theft can’t be damaging. But even Panic says in their blog post that they were not too concerned with competitors using their code either, mainly because it would quickly become outdated:</p>

<p><em>“That source is already missing a ton of fixes and improvements we committed over the last week alone, and six months from now it will be missing major critical new features. In short: it’s old and getting older.”</em></p>

<p>So maybe code by itself is not that valuable, and yet, software companies still have value. If the tangible aspects of the technology, the code and documentation, are not the main assets of a company, what is?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-programming">What is programming</h3>

<p>I couldn’t really wrap my head around the previous question until I stumbled upon a wonderful article, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" target="_blank">Programming as Theory Building</a>, written by none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award" target="_blank">Turing Award</a> winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a>. If you’ve ever taken any formal computer science classes, you may have already heard his name: He’s the N in BNF, or Backus-Naur form, an important and widely-used notation for describing programming languages.</p>

<p>In the article, Naur describes his view of what programming really is. He argues that the main activity a programmer does is building a theory or model of the problem space in their head:</p>

<p><em>“[…] programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand.”</em></p>

<p>He calls this view of programming the <em>“Theory Building View”</em> and puts it in contrast to what he calls the <em>“Production View”</em>, in which <em>“[…] programming is regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.”</em></p>

<p>Naur argues that the production view, while it is widespread, contradicts many things we observe empirically in software projects. In contrast, the Theory Building View allows us to explain many phenomena, such as the observation I made in this article, that the source code itself holds little to no value.<sup id="fnref:naurwasfaster"><a href="#fn:naurwasfaster">1</a></sup> One of Naur’s main conclusions is that making changes to an existing program (to accommodate changing requirements) is often more costly than writing new code from scratch, at least if done by people from a different team. This is because there are intangible aspects of the model/theory in the programmer’s heads, which can’t be expressed in code and documentation:</p>

<p><em>“A main claim of the Theory Building View of programming is that an essential part of any program, the theory of it, is something that could not be conceivably expressed, but is inextricably bound to human beings.”</em></p>

<p>When a new team obtains the source code, they thus have to first re-build the original theory in their heads, which, Naur argues, can be more work than building their own theory from the ground up.</p>

<p>Naur brings multiple examples of real life product development where teams were asked to modify or extend a program, but couldn’t do it without help from the original development team, or otherwise they would be <em>“destroying its power and simplicity”</em>:</p>

<p><em>“[…] the program text and its documentation has proved insufficient as a carrier of some of the most important design ideas.”</em></p>

<p>Naur further says:</p>

<p><em>“The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.”</em></p>

<p>Since this knowledge is inherently intangible, it can’t be communicated through the code or documentation - it has to be experienced anew by each new programmer joining the team. While the previous programmers can help new team members in this task, the code itself and any written documentation is not very useful in this process. What are these intangible elements/aspects?</p>

</div>

<h3 id="intangible-aspects-of-software">Intangible aspects of software</h3>

<p>According to Naur, there are three aspects that are difficult or impossible to express in any written form of code or documentation, and yet the original programmer can easily explain them:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> The programmer knows and understands the relationship of the real world problem and the program. They can explain how the details of the problem are mapped into the code and into additional documentation:
<em>“Thus the programmer must be able to explain, for each part of the program text and for each of its overall structural characteristics, what aspect or activity of the world is matched by it.”</em></p>

<p>While I think it’s possible in theory to make this knowledge more tangible through documentation, doing so exhaustively would be wholly impractical. And yet, Naur notes, an exhaustive understanding of the real world problem is necessary to understand the theory of the program:</p>

<p><em>“By far the largest part of the world will of course lie outside the scope of the program text, being irrelevant in the context. However, the decision that a part of the world is relevant can only be made by someone who understands the whole world. This understanding must be contributed by the programmer.”</em></p>

<p>Let me give you an example from my own experience. A few years back, I was working on a project that improved the processes of a production line in a factory. The workers there were still using paper checklists for quality assurance, making the process labor-intense and error prone. We replaced those paper checklists with a mobile app that runs on a tablet. While the app itself was fairly simple, the underlying business processes were complex - multiple different assembly lines and a variety of different machines were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Data labelling is often the biggest bottleneck in machine learning — finding, managing and labelling vast quantities of data to build a sufficiently performing model can take weeks or months. Active learning lets you train machine learning models with <strong>much</strong> less labelled data. The best AI-driven companies, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=475s">Tesla, already use active learning</a>. We think you should too.</p><h2 id="the-conventional-approach-vs-active-learning-creating-a-spam-filter">The conventional approach vs active learning - creating a spam filter</h2><p>Imagine that you wanted to build a spam filter for your emails. The conventional approach (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">at least since 2002</a>) is to collect a large number of emails, label them as "spam" or "not spam" and then train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between the two classes. The conventional approach assumes all the data is equally valuable, but in most datasets there are class imbalances, noisy data and lots of redundancy.</p><blockquote><strong>The conventional approach wastes time labelling data that doesn't improve your model's performance. And you don't even know if your model is useful until you've finished labelling all the data.</strong></blockquote><p>Humans don't require thousands of randomly labelled examples to learn the difference between spam and legitimate email. If you were teaching a human to solve this task you'd expect to be able to give them a few examples of what you want, have them learn quickly and ask questions when they were unsure.</p><p>Active learning operates using the same intuition, using the model you're training to find and label only the most valuable data.</p><p>In active learning, you first provide a small number of labelled examples. The model is trained on this "seed" dataset. Then, the model "asks questions" by selecting the unlabeled data points it is unsure about, so the human can "answer" the questions by providing labels for those points. The model updates again and the process is repeated until the performance is good enough. <strong>By having the human iteratively teach the model, it's possible to make a better model, in less time, with much less labelled data.</strong></p><p>So how can the model find the next data point that needs labelling? Some commonly used methods are:</p><ol><li>select the data points where the model's predictive distribution has highest entropy</li><li>pick data points where the model's favored prediction is least confident</li><li>train an ensemble of models and focus on the data points where they disagree</li></ol><p>At Humanloop we actually use custom methods that leverage Bayesian deep learning to get better uncertainty estimates.</p><h2 id="three-benefits-of-using-active-learning">Three Benefits of Using Active Learning</h2><h3 id="1-you-spend-less-time-and-money-on-labelling-data">1. You spend less time and money on labelling data</h3><p>Active learning has been shown to deliver large savings in data labelling across a wide range of tasks and data sets ranging from computer vision to NLP. Since data labelling is one of the most expensive parts of training modern machine learning models this should be enough justification on its own!</p><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/learning_curves.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png 700w"><figcaption>Using active learning gets to higher model accuracies with less labelled data</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-you-get-faster-feedback-on-model-performance">2. You get faster feedback on model performance</h3><p>Usually people label their data <em>before</em> they train any models or get any feedback. Often, it takes days or weeks of iterating on annotation guidelines and re-labelling only to discover that model performance falls far short of what is needed, or different labelled data is required. Since Active Learning trains a model frequently <em>during</em> the data labelling process, it's possible to get feedback and correct issues that might otherwise be discovered much later.</p><h3 id="3-your-model-will-have-higher-final-accuracy">3. Your model will have higher final accuracy</h3><p>People are often surprised that models trained with active learning not only learn faster but can actually converge to a better final model (with less data). We're told so often that more data is better, that it's easy to forget that the quality of the data matters just as much as the quantity. If the dataset contains ambiguous examples which are hard to label accurately this can actually degrade your final model performance.</p><p>The order the model sees examples also matters. There's an entire sub-field of machine learning, called curriculum learning, which studies how you can improve model performance by first teaching about simple concepts before teaching complex ones. &nbsp;Think "Arithmetic before advanced calculus". Active learning naturally enforces a curriculum on your models and helps them achieve better overall performance.</p><h2 id="if-active-learning-is-so-great-then-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-it">If active learning is so great, then why doesn't everyone use it?</h2><p>Most of our tools and processes for building machine learning models weren't designed with Active Learning in mind. There are often different teams of people responsible for data labelling vs model training but active learning requires these processes to be coupled. If you do get these teams to work together, you still need a lot of infrastructure to connect model training to annotation interfaces. Most of the software libraries being used assume all of your data is labelled before you train a model, so to use active learning you have to write a tonne of boiler plate. You also need to figure out how best to host your model, have the model communicate with a team of annotators and update itself as it gets data asynchronously from different annotators.</p><p>On top of this, modern deep learning models are very slow to update, so frequently retraining them from scratch is painful. Nobody wants to label a hundred examples then wait 24 hours for a model to be fully re-trained before labelling the next 100. Deep learning models also tend to have millions or billions of parameters and getting good uncertainty estimates from these models is an open research problem.</p><p>If you read academic papers on active learning, you might think active learning will give you a small saving in labels but for a huge amount of work. The papers are misleading though because they operate on academic datasets that tend to be balanced/clean. They almost always label one example at a time and they forget that not every data-point is equally easy to label. On more realistic problems with large class imbalances, noisy data and variable labelling costs, the benefits can be much bigger than the literature suggests. In some cases there can be a 10x reduction in labelling costs.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-active-learning-today">How to use Active Learning today</h2><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/logos-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/logos-1.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/logos-1.png 1000w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/logos-1.png 1600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/logos-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many of the biggest hurdles to using active learning are just a question of having the right infrastructure. Just as tools like Keras and PyTorch dramatically reduced the pain of deriving gradients, new tools are emerging to make active learning much easier.</p><p>There are open source python libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL">modAL</a> that take away much of the boilerplate. ModAL is built on top of scikit-learn and lets you combine different models with any active learning strategy you like. It takes much of the work out of implementing different uncertainty measures, is open source and modular. The pros of ModAL are the range of methods it provides out of the box and the fact that it's open source. The downside of libraries like modAL is they don't include any annotation interfaces and still leave the work of hosting a model and connecting it to annotation interfaces up to you.</p><p>That brings us to annotation interfaces:</p><p>Probably the most popular tool for individual data scientists is Prodigy. Prodigy is an annotation interface built by the makers of Spacy and so can naturally be combined with their fantastic NLP library to use basic active learning. It's not open-source but you can download it as a pip wheel and install it locally. Whilst Prodigy is a good tool for individuals, it hasn't been designed to support teams of annotators and only implements the most basic forms of Active Learning. To make this work with teams, still requires you to host prodigy yourself and can be a lot of work to set up.</p><p>Labelbox provides interfaces for a variety of image annotations and has recently added support for text as well. Unlike Prodigy, Labelbox has been designed with teams of annotators in mind and has more tools for ensuring that your labels are correct. They don't have any native support for active learning or model training but do allow you to upload predictions from your model to the annotation interface via API. This means that if you have implemented an active learning acquisition function and are training a model, you can set up an active learning loop. Though the most of the work is left to you.</p><h2 id="humanloop">Humanloop</h2><p>We built Humanloop to solve many of the problems of existing tools. Our goal is to make deploying and maintaining natural language models faster and easier than ever before.</p><p>Humanloop provides an annotation interface for NLP tasks that lets you train a model as you annotate and uses active learning out of the box. We support teams of annotators and have incorporated state of the art techniques for active learning and quality assurance. This makes it possible to get real time feedback during training, even when using modern deep models. We also make it easy to deploy to an optimised model run-time immediately after training and to even update your data post deployment.</p><h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2><p>Active Learning:</p><ul><li>reduces how much data you need to label, dramatically reducing one of your biggest costs.</li><li>gives you faster feedback on your model's performance.</li><li>producer higher performing models.</li></ul><p>At Humanloop we think that active learning should be a standard tool for data scientists. We also believe that good tools should make this easy.</p><p>There's more to Humanloop than active learning though. We're building infrastructure for AI models and human teams to work alongside each other so that anyone can quickly augment their team with AI assistance.</p><p>If you're interested in finding out more, send us a message or <a href="https://humanloop.com/demo">book a demo!</a></p>

                <p>After posting about the <a href="http://www.geofcrowl.com/blog/articles/2020/2/13/openstep-user-interface-guidelines/">OpenStep User Interface Guide</a>, I started to wonder how many different human interface guides or software design guides that I could find from the past and present. It doesn’t seem like there’s a good collection of these anywhere on the internet, especially in regard to past software design guides. I think there’s a lot of value in these even outside of just being a historic reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>How well is <code>__int128</code> supported, and what are its
properties? A Godbolt-based survey of the Big Four compilers.
Spoiler alert: libc++ thinks it’s integral, libstdc++ thinks it’s integral
only in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode(!), and MSVC thinks it doesn’t exist at all.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Rein Halbersma for alerting me to libstdc++’s different behavior
in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode versus <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-support">Compiler support</h2>



<p>GCC, Clang, and Intel ICC all support a built-in <code>__int128</code> type.
Microsoft MSVC does not support any 128-bit integral type as far as I’m aware.</p>

<p>On GCC, Clang, and ICC, <code>__int128</code> is a token similar to <code>int</code>: you can modify
it with <code>unsigned</code> to produce <code>unsigned __int128</code>. However, all three front-ends
also support the built-in synonyms <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__int128_t, __int128&gt;);
static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__uint128_t, unsigned __int128&gt;);
    // PASSES on all three compilers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code> are safe to use in non-type template parameters
and constant expressions, on all compilers that support them.</p>

<h2 id="sneaky-macros">Sneaky macros</h2>

<p>The story on libstdc++ is complicated. Libstdc++ doesn’t do anything special for
<code>__int128</code>, but it does provide <em>macro hooks</em>
(<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/87798f3f2cf97b30e75110b5a8d2964aef62be02/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/type_traits#L285-L293">link</a>)
so that for example
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> will be treated as an integral type, whatever that macro
expands to. (If it doesn’t expand to anything, it’ll be ignored.)</p>

<p>If you compile with GCC in <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>),
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> won’t be defined and so libstdc++ will consider
<code>__int128</code> a non-integral type.</p>

<p>But if you compile with GCC in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>), then the compiler
will pre-define these two macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define __GLIBCXX_BITSIZE_INT_N_0 128
#define __GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0 __int128
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23156">As of July 2016-ish</a>, Clang also
defines these two macros in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode.</p>

<p>By the way, you can use the options <code>-dM -E</code> to view all your compiler’s pre-defined macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>clang++ -std=c++17 -dM -E test.cc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The upshot is, if you compile in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will treat <code>__int128</code> and
<code>unsigned __int128</code> as integral types with the proper numeric limits; but if you
compile in the usual <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will not do any of that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libc++ treats <code>__int128</code> as an integer type, full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve worked on several projects that compiled with <code>-std=c++17 -D_GNU_SOURCE</code>. That
will give you a lot of GNU library extensions, but it will not give you <code>__int128</code> support.
libstdc++ is looking specifically for the two macros defined above, and <code>-D_GNU_SOURCE</code>
doesn’t enable those macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="relationship-to-integer-types-and-intmax_t">Relationship to integer types and <code>intmax_t</code></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libstdc++ (in standard, non-<code>gnu++XX</code> mode) leaves <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> as <code>false</code>.
This makes a certain amount of sense from the library implementor’s point of view,
because <code>__int128</code> is not one of the <em>standard</em> integral types, and furthermore,
if you <em>call</em> it integral, then you have to face the consequence that <code>intmax_t</code>
(which is 64 bits on every ABI that matters) is kind of lying about being the
“max.”</p>

<p>In <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ makes <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> come out to <code>true</code>,
as described in the previous section on sneaky macros.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, libc++ simply
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/aeeba70ab15e1469841c0f3f1f9c78211a541699/include/type_traits#L738-L741">sets</a>
sets <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>, unconditionally.</p>

<p>Yes, this means that on libc++ (or on libstdc++ with <code>-std=gnu++17</code>), there exist
integral values that do not fit in <code>intmax_t</code>! (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/lMD4Iu">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you’re wondering: libstdc++ in standard C++17 mode considers <code>__int128</code> a “compound” type.
The definition of “compound type” is simply “anything that’s not a fundamental type,”
where “fundamental” encompasses the arithmetic types (both integral and floating-point), <code>void</code>,
and <code>nullptr_t</code>. So for example <code>int*</code> is also a compound type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="numeric-limits">Numeric limits</h2>

<p>In standard (non-<code>gnu++XX</code>) mode, libstdc++ does not specialize <code>numeric_limits</code> for <code>__int128</code> at all.
This <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/RpaD-7">has the unfortunate effect</a> of</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constexpr __int128 int128_max =
    std::numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max();
static_assert(int128_max == 0);  // TRUE on libstdc++ in standard mode
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) provides the appropriate specialization, so that
<code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::min()</code> and <code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max()</code>
have the appropriate values instead of zero.</p>

<p>On libc++ <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ZR_nn6"><code>numeric_limits</code> reports <code>__int128</code> as an integral type</a>,
whereas on libstdc++ in standard mode it doesn’t (again because there is no specialization for
<code>__int128</code> at all).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;I128&gt;::is_integer);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="signedness">Signedness</h2>

<p>libc++ reports that <code>is_signed_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> and <code>is_unsigned_v&lt;unsigned __int128&gt;</code>.
libstdc++ in standard mode of course denies both, because only arithmetic types can be
signed or unsigned, and libstdc++ denies that <code>__int128</code> is arithmetic.</p>

<p>As for <code>make_signed</code>, libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) reports what you’d expect —
<code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__int128_t</code>, and <code>make_unsigned&lt;__int128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to instantiate <code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;</code> on libstdc++ in standard mode
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/j7BvKB">results in</a> a hard error which is not SFINAE-friendly.
(It’s undefined behavior to instantiate <code>make_signed</code> of any type which is neither
integral nor an enumeration type.)</p>

<p>Incidentally, today I learned that <code>is_signed_v&lt;float&gt; == true</code> but <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/t6v1CJ"><code>make_signed_t&lt;float&gt;</code>
is a hard error</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>For more on <code>__uint128_t</code> arithmetic, see
<a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/02/13/wide-integer-proof-of-concept/">“The abstraction penalty for wide integer math on x86-64”</a> (2020-02-13).</p>

Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your computer:</strong> Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?</p><p><strong>The server:</strong> Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?</p><p>Using this information, the browser creates something called... the DOM!</p><div><p><img alt="Introducing the DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Wait a second, the DOM is a ... tree? Yup, a tree! Oddly enough, a lot of things in our computer look like a tree. Let's give our tree friend a nickname... hmm what about Domo?</p><p>Domo works as a model at the prestigious art studio "Web Browser". His job is to pose in front of the artist who paints a portrait (or perhaps millions of portraits).</p><div><p><img alt="Domo at the art studio Web Browser" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In real life, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's indeed a model -- a model of the document (aka the web page). It strikes a pose. The browser paints a portrait. The portraits are what we see on a web page: the textboxes, the paragraphs, the images and so on. A developer's job is like that of a director who tells Domo what to wear and what pose to strike. This determines what those portraits look like in the end.</p><p>To check out what the DOM looks like, if you are using a desktop browser, right-click on this very page and choose "Inspect". Can you make sense of what's in the Elements tab?</p><div><p><img alt="Inspect in Chrome" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3><a id="the-dom-api" href="#the-dom-api"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The DOM API</a></h3><p>We often want a web page to be dynamic and interactive -- that means its content changes from time to time: adding or removing text here and there, showing a modal, or updating a chart based on some new data coming from the server.</p><p>Remember, in order to change what's on a web page, we need to update the DOM. The artist isn't able to paint new portraits until Domo changes to a new pose.</p><p>How would we get Domo to change to a new pose?</p><p>We just talk to him. He listens. Interestingly, Domo's ears happen to have a name: <em>DOM API</em>.</p><div><p><img alt="A developer works with DOM API" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>To manipulate the DOM, a developer would write code in JavaScript which talks to the DOM API, and in turn, updates the content of the web page.</p><h3><a id="the-increasing-complexity" href="#the-increasing-complexity"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The increasing complexity</a></h3><p><em>Directly</em> talking to Domo has been the standard approach of web development for years, especially when the web content was mostly static. A developer would sprinkle some interactivity on top of the static pages by writing small amount of JavaScript code.</p><p>However, with the emergence of SPAs (Single Page Application) such as Gmail and Google Maps, people started to expect a lot more.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry! I'll show you some examples and explain these properties in details soon.</p><h3><a id="declarative-ui" href="#declarative-ui"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Declarative UI</a></h3><h4><a id="imperative-vs-declarative" href="#imperative-vs-declarative"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Imperative vs. declarative</a></h4><p>When directly working with the DOM API, we'd have to specify what element to change at the right time, in the right order. This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly.

The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>.

    <p>Lately I have been working on improving texture atlas allocation in WebRender. It isn't an outstanding technical feat, but the journey towards achieving this goal was quite pleasant. </p>
<p>This is a longer version of the piece I published in the <a href="https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/improving-texture-atlas-allocation-in-webrender/">mozilla gfx team blog</a> where I focus on the atlas allocation algorithms. In this one I'll go into more details about the process and methodology behind these improvements.</p>
<p>The first part is about the making of guillotiere, a crate that I first released in March 2019. In the second part we'll have a look at more recent work building upon what I did with guillotiere, to improve texture memory usage in WebRender/Firefox.</p>

<p>In order to submit work to the GPU efficiently, WebRender groups as many drawing primitives as it can into what we call batches. A batch is submitted to the GPU as a single drawing command and has a few constraints. for example a batch can only reference a fixed set of resources (such as GPU buffers and textures). So in order to group as many drawing primitives as possible in a single batch we need to place as many drawing parameters as possible in few resources. When rendering text, WebRender pre-renders the glyphs before compositing them on the screen  so this means packing as many pre-rendered glyphs as possible into a single texture, and the same applies for rendering images and various other things.</p>
<p>For a moment let's simplify the case of images and text and assume that it is the same problem: input images (rectangles) of various rectangular sizes that we need to pack into a larger rectangle. This is the job of the texture atlas allocator. Another common name for this is rectangle bin packing.</p>
<p><img alt="Atlas allocation" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/atlas-allocation.svg"></p>
<p>Many in game and web development are used to packing many images into fewer assets. In most cases this can be achieved at build time Which means that the texture atlas allocator only needs to find a good layout for a fixed set of rectangles without supporting dynamic deallocation and allocation within the atlas at run time. I call this "static" atlas allocation as opposed to "dynamic" atlas allocation.</p>
<p>There's a lot more literature out there about static than dynamic atlas allocation. I recommend reading <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a> which is a very good survey of various static packing algorithms. Dynamic atlas allocation is unfortunately more difficult to implement while keeping good run-time performance. WebRender needs to maintain texture atlases into which items are added and removed over time. In other words we don't have a way around needing dynamic atlas allocation.</p>

<p>A while back, WebRender had a naive implementation of the guillotine algorithm (explained in <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a>). This algorithm strikes a good compromise between packing quality and implementation complexity.
The main idea behind it can be explained simply: "Maintain a list of free rectangles, find one that can hold your allocation, split the requested allocation size out of it, creating up to two additional rectangles that are added back to the free list.". There is subtlety in which free rectangle to choose and how to split it, but the overall, the algorithm is built upon reassuringly understandable concepts.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation steps" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-alloc.svg"></p>
<p>Deallocation could simply consist of adding the deallocated rectangle back to the free list, but without some way to merge back neighbor free rectangles, the atlas would quickly get into a fragmented stated with a lot of small free rectangles and can't allocate larger ones anymore.</p>
<p><img alt="Fragmented state" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/fragmented.svg"></p>
<p>To address that, WebRender's implementation would regularly do a O(n²) complexity search to find and merge neighbor free rectangles, which was very slow when dealing with thousands of items. Eventually we stopped using the  guillotine allocator in systems that needed support for deallocation, replacing it with a very simple slab allocator which I'll get back to later in this post.</p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with moving to a worse allocator because of the run-time defragmentation issue, so as a side project I wrote a guillotine allocator that tracks rectangle splits in a tree in order to find and merge neighbor free rectangle in constant instead of quadratic time. I published it in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/guillotiere">guillotiere</a> crate. I wrote about how it works in details in <a href="https://docs.rs/guillotiere/0.6.0/guillotiere/struct.AtlasAllocator.html">the documentation</a> so I won't go over it here. I'm quite happy about how it turned out, although I haven't pushed to use it in WebRender, mostly because I wanted to first see evidence that it would help and I already had evidence that many other things needed to be worked on.</p>
<h2>Visualizing program state using SVG</h2>
<p>guillotiere lets you dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG format.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-example-1.svg"></p>
<p>The image above shows the state of the atlas after a few allocations. Allocated space is represented in light blue while free space is in dark gray. It is much easier to work with than a list of coordinates in plain text. It was handy when developing and tuning the algorithm, but also when using it in other projects. While looking at the visual representation of the state animate you quickly develop an intuition of how the algorithm unfolds Concepts that are hard to explain in written form sometimes just "make sense" visually.</p>
<p>Dumping visual representations in a .svg file is not only a powerful tool when exploring problem some spaces, it is also surprisingly simple to do. SVG is a straightforward XML type of format which is annoying to type by hand but effortless to generate with very simple helpers. Here is how it looks using a tiny helper crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/svg_fmt">svg_fmt</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>    </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>svg_fmt</span>::<span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span>

</code></pre></div>


<p>So many useful visualizations can be easily built out of simple colored rectangles and text and there's other primitives provided by svg_fmt. Rectangles were all I needed in guillotiere.</p>
<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/nical/rust_debug/blob/492600cac47f64bcadaf9ad037ed64c5fecc8e63/svg_fmt/src/svg.rs">how simple the svg_fmt code is</a>. It has become a dependency to most of the things I've worked on lately, including WebRender which uses it to dump visualizations of texture atlases and the render graph.</p>
<p><img alt="Render graph visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/rendergraph.svg"></p>
<p>My hope by now is that if you are working on problems that can be represented in 2D space, I've managed to convince you of how easily you can supplement or break free of reading text in your debugger/terminal. If anything, just <code>println!(r#"&lt;rect x="{}" y="{}" width="{}" height="{}" fill:rgb(100,0,0)" /&gt;""#, x, y, w, h);</code> your way into looking at your algorithms unfolding.</p>
<h2>Making/testing/debugging a small rust crate</h2>
<p>I had a great time writing guillotiere for several reasons. The problem itself had some nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a well defined problem with simple input and output data. As a result it is very easy to write unit tests and fuzz the code.</li>
<li>No nebulous design space for fancy abstractions. A retained state, query a size in, get a rectangle out. Simple.</li>
<li>Can be implemented in its own library outside of a big rendering engine, and enjoy fast compile/debug iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the Rust programming language and ecosystem that really made it a such pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping a simple library, creating unit tests, adding dependencies is simple and effortless in Rust. This alone is a huge time saver for me compared to when I would do this sort of thing in C++ (I can only hope that the situation has improved in C++ since). Fellow Rust developers are pretty used to that so let's move on.</p>
<p>I quickly wrote a simple command-line application to interactively play with the packing algorithm.
The application deserializes the state of the atlas from a file, execute a command (for example allocation or deallocation) and serializes back into the file (using the .ron file format). In addition, the command-line application could dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG.</p>
<p>The command-line app was put together very quickly thanks to fantastic pieces of the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">serde</a> for serialization/deserialzation,</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/ron">ron</a> providing a nice and readable serialized file format,</li>
<li>and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> for parsing command-line arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together, this gave me an interactive playground to test the algorithm. Playing around in a terminal would look like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ guillotiere init <span>1024</span> <span>1024</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>16</span> <span>32</span>
Allocated rectangle r1 of size 16x32 at origin <span>[</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>200</span> <span>100</span> --svg <span>01</span>.svg
Allocated rectangle r2 of size 200x100 at origin <span>[</span><span>16</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere deallocate r1 --svg <span>02</span>.svg

etc...
</code></pre></div>


<p>At any time in that sequence of commands I can open the <code>atlas.ron</code> file and read the state of the atlas as if I was in a debugger, can also copy it around to save the state in a way that almost feels as powerful as using <a href="https://rr-project.org/">record-and-replay debugging</a>.</p>
<h2>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>I mentioned fuzzing earlier. <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz">Cargo fuzz</a> is a joy and I really recommend using it whenever possible. It's very easy to setup, I wouldn't necessarily run it on every push, but every once in a while to find some bugs and/or get a bit of confidence about the robustness of your code. It's great. It has plenty of well written <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/">documentation</a> so I won't go into details here. I'll just mention that it's a very well made piece of Rust's ecosystem that contributes to the greatness of the whole in my opinion.</p>

<p>Fast forward the end of 2020. Ah 2020.</p>
<p>I was investigating further improvements to draw call batching and texture upload overhead which are big performance bottlenecks on low end Intel GPUs, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Gathering some statistics about what causes new batches to be generated shows that it is often happening when multiple primitives use the same shader but are …</p></div></div>

<p>As someone who loves discussing Software Craftsmanship and best practices, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a bit of a sore spot for me. Let me start off by saying that I <em>love</em> TDD’s emphasis on testing. Too many software projects skimp on testing. And the results speak for themselves many years down the road, when <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">changes take exponentially longer to implement, and people are too afraid to even touch anything</a>.</p>



<p>That said, I’ve still never been a big fan of TDD. One the one hand, it’s too strict. Insisting on writing tests first, often gets in the way of the exploratory work – work that is needed before you can iron out what the right interfaces, methods, and OO-structure should be.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, TDD is ironically <em>too lenient</em>. Many practitioners assume that because they are practicing TDD, their test-suite is rock solid. When in reality, I’ve seen far too many tests written during TDD, that still suffer from gaping coverage holes. Coverage holes that can and will result in production bugs, either now or in the future. As far as testing methodology goes, plugging these coverage holes should be your top priority – overriding all other fads and recommendations.</p>



<p>Hence why my favored testing philosophy is best illustrated by Mutation Driven Testing, which follows this sequence of steps:</p>



<ol><li>Get to a state where you have both code and successfully passing tests<ol><li>Whether you should write code-first or test-first is best debated elsewhere. You’re certainly welcome to use TDD to get to this point</li></ol></li><li>Go through your newly added/modified code, line by line, and manually inject a single bug<ol><li>When deciding what a “reasonable bug” is, assume carelessness, laziness, inexperience and incompetence. But not malice. Using tests to catch malicious bugs is exponentially harder, and less realistic</li></ol></li><li>Verify that some test now fails</li><li>If a test does not fail, review what coverage holes you have in your tests, and fix them by adding new tests or updating your existing tests<ol><li>The better you become at writing tests, the less often this should occur</li></ol></li><li>Undo the bug you just injected, and verify that your tests are now passing</li><li>Go back to step 2 and repeat, until you’ve injected every bug you can think of, or have run out of time<ol><li>As you get the hang for Mutation-Driven-Testing, you’ll develop an intuitive knack for figuring out which bugs are most likely to slip past your average test suite. This will dramatically speed up this process, and also teach you to write more comprehensive tests</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>The philosophy behind Mutation-Driven-Testing is simple. The only way to assess the reliability of your test suite, is to see whether it fails when a bug is present. So inject that bug yourself. Use the resulting output to figure out where your coverage holes are, and strengthen them as appropriate. Not just to catch the specific bug you just injected, but any other similar category of bug too. By doing this, you can identify the blind spots in your test suite, and strengthen your test coverage accordingly.</p>



<p><em>Sidenote: <a href="https://pitest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There is tooling out there</a> that attempts to automate the above form of mutation testing. I look forward to the day when they become mainstream, and just as comprehensive. For now, this article will focus on manually injected mutations.</em></p>



<h2>A TDD Example</h2>



<p>If you listen closely, you can hear a million TDD proponents crying out in protest.</p>



<p><em>“But you don’t need to do Mutation Testing if you’ve actually done TDD! If you do TDD correctly, every single piece of functionality will have a dedicated test, so you will never ever have a coverage hole!”</em></p>



<p>To illustrate why this is not true, and to demonstrate the benefits of Mutation-Driven-Testing, I have put together the following example. <a href="https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The source of the example</a> is the top google result, when you search for “TDD Example”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One might argue that the author of this article is not a good role model for TDD. That <em>“no true TDD practitioner”</em> would write tests like in the above example. But this really is just sour grapes. The author is making a concerted effort to write comprehensive tests, has done a good job, and the example chosen below is very simple. The reality of TDD in the workplace, is that most practitioners aren’t perfect, and are always prone to some oversights. Oversights that can be flagged and fixed with Mutation-Driven-Testing.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s dive into the example – creating a simple string-based calculator. For the sake of conciseness, let’s look at just the first 3 requirements in the example, along with their implementations and tests.</p>



<p>Requirements:</p>



<ol><li>The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma</li><li>For an empty string the method will return 0</li><li>Method will return their sum of numbers</li></ol>



<p>Tests:</p>


<pre title="">private static final TddExample EXAMPLE = new TddExample();

@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
public final void whenMoreThan2NumbersAreUsedThenExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,2,3");
}

@Test
public final void when2NumbersAreUsedThenNoExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,2");
  Assert.assertTrue(true);
}

@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
public final void whenNonNumberIsUsedThenExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,X");
}

@Test
public final void whenEmptyStringIsUsedThenReturnValueIs0() {
  Assert.assertEquals(0, EXAMPLE.add(""));
}

@Test
public final void whenOneNumberIsUsedThenReturnValueIsThatSameNumber() {
  Assert.assertEquals(3, EXAMPLE.add("3"));
}

@Test
public final void whenTwoNumbersAreUsedThenReturnValueIsTheirSum() {
  Assert.assertEquals(3+6, EXAMPLE.add("3,6"));
}
</pre>


<p>Implementation:</p>


<pre title="">public int add(final String numbers) {
  int returnValue = 0;
  String[] numbersArray = numbers.split(",");
  if (numbersArray.length &gt; 2) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
  }
  for (String number : numbersArray) {
    if (!number.trim().isEmpty()) { // After refactoring
      returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
    }
  }
  return returnValue;
}
</pre>


<p>Certainly seems like a good suite of tests that covers all functionality. But how well does it stand up to Mutation-Driven-Testing? In the real world, I would inject bugs one at a time, and run the tests after each injection. But for the sake of conciseness, let’s just inject all the relevant bugs at once.</p>



<h2>Mutation 1: Empty vs Blank</h2>


<pre title="">if (!number.trim().isEmpty())
</pre>


<p>This is a bit of a freebie, but worth pointing out. What if we just removed the <em>trim()</em> call from our implementation. Certainly seems like a plausible oversight.</p>


<pre title="">if (!number.isEmpty())
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 2: Return 0 for Empty String</h2>


<pre title="">if (!number.trim().isEmpty()) { // After refactoring
  returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
}
</pre>


<p>The requirement says to return 0 for an empty string. Presumably, based on the author’s implementation, this means that any empty sub-string should be treated as 0, whereas previous non-empty sub-strings should still be summed. But what if the implementation does something different and returns 0 as soon as it sees any empty string?</p>


<pre title="">if (number.trim().isEmpty()) { return 0; }
returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 3: Three Inputs are not allowed</h2>


<pre title="">if (numbersArray.length &gt; 2) {
  throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
}
</pre>


<p>The requirement says that the method can take <em>“0, 1 or 2 numbers.”</em> So…. we should check for 3 numbers and throw an exception?</p>



<p>This is admittedly a pretty foolish bug, but never underestimate how creative fools can be.</p>


<pre title="">if (numbersArray.length == 3) {
  throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
}
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 4: Double vs Int</h2>


<pre title="">returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
</pre>


<p>When building a “string -&gt; numeric” calculator, with an integer final result, there are many different ways of implementing string conversions:</p>



<ol><li>Convert string to int, perform int operations, return an int result. Throw an exception if your input string is not an int</li><li>Convert string to double, cast the double to an int, perform int operations, return an int result</li><li>Convert string to double, perform double operations, cast the final result to an int and return it</li></ol>



<p>The above 3 approaches all produce completely different outputs when given an input like <code>"1.5, 1.5"</code>. In the example, the author had implemented option #1. Let’s assume that is indeed the desired behavior. But what if he had mistakenly implemented option #3?</p>


<pre title="">returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
</pre>


<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>



<p>In practice, we would only inject a single bug at a time. But for the purposes of conciseness, let’s combine all of them, which leaves us with the following mess:</p>


<pre title="">public int add(final String numbers) {
  double returnValue = 0;
  String[] numbersArray = numbers.split(",");
  if (numbersArray.length == 3) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
  }
  for (String number : numbersArray) {
    if (number.isEmpty()) { return 0; }
    returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
  }
  return (int) returnValue;
}
</pre>


<p>Amazingly, not a single test has failed! Every single test written by the author is still green, despite us injecting plausible bugs in every other line. Demonstrating that our test suite has the following holes:</p>



<ol><li>It is not testing for blank inputs</li><li>It is not testing for empty/blank substrings where a number is supposed to be</li><li>It is not testing for arbitrary numbers of inputs</li><li>It is not testing for numeric non-integer inputs</li></ol>



<p>And once you’ve identified the above holes, you can start plugging them by adding more tests. Tests that are now failing, and start passing once you revert all the injected bugs:</p>


<pre title="">@Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class)
public void doubleInputProvided_shouldThrowException() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1.5,1.5");
}

@Test
public void blankString_shouldReturn0() {
  Assert.assertEquals(0, EXAMPLE.add(" "));
}

@Test
public void emptyStringAfterNumbers_shouldIgnoreIt() {
  Assert.assertEquals(1, …</pre></div></div>

<p>I recently lost access to a free email account I’ve had since before I can remember (though only temporarily, thank the lord). When it happened, I instantly became effectively uncontactable by a large portion of humanity. My own temporary disappearance from reality started me to thinking about how we can reuse existing infrastructure to store contact information in a durable and highly available way.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h2>

<p>My requirements for a durable contact storage solution are (in no particular order):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Public: No authentication shoudl be required to read someone’s contact information.</li>
  <li>Globally accessible: Anyone should be able to read the information at any time, from anywhere</li>
  <li>Highly available: It should (almost) never go down. One company going bankrupt or changing strategic direction shouldn’t kill it.</li>
  <li>Censorship resistant: It should only be possible to take down records with a court order. Corporate censorship should be impossible, or at least historically infrequent.</li>
  <li>Cheap: But not free! Free services come with few no guarantees, and even fewer rights for their users.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance: User only needs to get involved when the data needs to change. No operational burden</li>
  <li>Easy to use: Clients should be able to read information trivially.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of services that check some of these boxes. Twitter for instance does pretty well, but fails badly on 3, 4 &amp; 5. This is where most services fall down, so I focused there. After pondering this for a while, I realized that we’ve already got a great solution that checks all the boxes: DNS.</p>

<h3 id="highly-available">Highly available</h3>

<p>There are many services that are highly available in the technical sense, meaning they rarely crash, but suffer from economic risk. The ultimate crash is the business that provides the service going bankrupt or changing strategic direction. DNS doesn’t suffer from the same economic risk that centralized services do because there are many, many independent registrars and DNS service providers out there.</p>

<h3 id="censorship-resistance">Censorship resistance</h3>

<p>I would argue that DNS registries are censorship <em>resistant</em> based on the historical record. Whatever you think about the situation, the fact is Parler the application got vaporized in a day, but Parler.com is still registered. The Pirate Bay is one of the most taken down sites in history, and thepiratebay.org is still registered.</p>

<h3 id="cheap">Cheap</h3>

<p>This one is easy. There are loads of registrars that sell a variety of gTLD subdomains, complete with DNS service, for less than $10 per year. Enough said.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h3>

<p>DNS does so well on the other requirements, it’s a shame that we’d have to use some arcane protocol to query it. Oh wait…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=landshark.io&amp;type=TXT'  | jq -r .Answer[].data

"v=me; email=alan.gibson@gmail.com"
"v=me; twitter=handheld"
"v=me; blog=https://landshark.io"
"v=me; gravatar=https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123456"
"v=me; bitcoin=123456789"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DNS over HTTP (DoH) means DNS is now trivially easy to query and hard to snoop on. Not too shabby.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-way">A better way</h3>

<p>On the Internet, I’m alan.gibson@gmail.com, as well as twitter.com/handheld, news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alangibson, and so many more. Wouldn’t it be alot simpler if  we used DNS TXT records to store all those various identifiers in one place so that you could find me anywhere just by knowing that I’m landshark.io?</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty slick solution to me. What do you think? <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26024845">Discussion is happening in this Hacker News thread.</a></p>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>
