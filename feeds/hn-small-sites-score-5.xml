<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being productive all the time is not just difficult, it might actually burn you out, but that being said lack of productivity for an extended period of time is dangerous too because it gives the mind an excuse to start looking at all the negative things happening in the world, especially with the global pandemic going on. </p><p>So how does one stay productive consistently? I find that the only way to be productive is through feedback. To be productive you need to receive a small but noticeable reward for attempting to be productive. If that did not make any sense, let me try and explain it with an example.</p><p><strong>Kickstarting the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I wanted to write a piece of content today because I have not written anything in a long period of time. Once this piece is out there on a few social media platforms, I might see a small but noticeable spike in the traffic to my blog which I can confirm from my good friend google analytics. This little spike in traffic is my tiny reward which will kick start a feedback loop.</p><p>Now there is higher likelihood that I will try and write some more content next week because I still remember the feeling of that reward and I want to feel it again, but the difference now is that I have built a tolerance for this reward and the only way I would feel satisfied is if I receive a higher reward which in this case might translate to a higher spike in google analytics.</p><p><strong>Add incremental steps to the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>To receive a higher reward I am now motivated to write better quality content which reaches a wider group of audience and what gets even better is if people start engaging with me after reading my post and wish to dwell further into the subject. </p><p>If I can keep this up every week while slightly increasing the quantum of work but also the quantum of reward, eventually it becomes a habit that I can no longer ignore.</p><p><strong>Use the feedback loop for everything</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I build software, so for me the feedback loop translates to building a small software module that does one particular task, run a few tests on it to see if it functions like it should and this will kick start the feedback loop. I feel rewarded that I built one tiny part of a large project which works perfectly and is ready to be integrated with the rest of the project.</p><p>Incremental steps can then be added by combining different modules with each other and making them work together. The loop becomes much stronger once there is an actual visual component to look at and interact with because at this point you have basically created something tangible and the reward you get from that lasts much longer than the smaller rewards.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>It is entirely possible that I put out this piece of content today and nobody cares. Maybe I do not see any spike in google analytics at all. But the very fact that I managed to write something today and share it a few people who are at the very least likely to give it a read creates a feeling of accomplishment which serves as a small reward to kick start the feedback loop. </p><p>Sometimes the reward is not as great as expected but as long as it is not zero, the loop is strong enough to get you going.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently worked on an open source <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">project called Jupiter</a>, an online AI to beat the popular online game <a href="http://play2048.co/">2048</a>.</p>
<p>Go try out the AI:</p>
<p><a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtrp/jupiter/master/demo-image.png" alt="Jupiter Screenshot"></a></p>
<p>In writing this AI, I decided to use a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Monte Carlo algorithms like the one used in Jupiter have been used in several notable AIs, including DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>, which famously beat the Go world champion in May 2017.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why the Monte Carlo method works</li>
<li>When and where Monte Carlo algorithms can be useful </li>
<li>How I used the Monte Carlo method in an AI to beat 2048</li>
<li>How to implement Monte Carlo algorithms in JavaScript and other languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I got the idea of using a Monte Carlo method to beat 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<h2>What is the Monte Carlo Method?</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is the idea of using a large number of random simulations of an experiment to gain insights into the experiment's end results. Random simulations of an experiment are frequently referred to as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you were flipping a coin, and trying to figure out the probability of the coin landing heads. With the Monte Carlo method, we could simulate 10,000 coin tosses, and calculate the percentage of coins that landed heads.</p>
<p>Here's what that would look like.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/using-the-monte-carlo-tree-search-algorithm-in-an-ai-to-beat-2048-and-other-games/coinflip.png" alt="Flip Coin Example Graph"></p>
<p>As can be seen, the result converges to the expected value, 50%. A notable feature of Monte Carlo simulations is that a higher number of simulations is correlated with higher accuracy. For example, if we only performed two simulations, there is a high (25%) probability of heads landing in both simulations, giving a result of 100%. This is very inaccurate in comparison to the expected result of 50%.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations <strong>work because of the Law of Large Numbers</strong>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you simulate the same experiment many times, the average of the results should converge to the expected value of the simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Monte Carlo simulations are a way to estimate what will happen in a given experiment <strong>without having to implement any specific algorithms or heuristics</strong>.</p>
<h2>When and Where the Monte Carlo Method Can Be Useful</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is used in a variety of fields, including game AI development, finance and economics, and evolutionary biology to name a few.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method can be useful in any experiment with a random factor, where end results cannot be predicted algorithmically. For example, in 2048, a new tile at a random location is added after every move, making it impossible to calculate the exact location of upcoming tiles and subsequently the end result of the game as well.</p>
<p>In these types of experiments, running a large number of Monte Carlo simulations can help get a sense of the average end results, the probability of various events occurring, and the relationship between the variables in the experiment.</p>
<p>For example, using the Monte Carlo method to in Jupiter allowed me to better understand how variables like starting move, number of moves in a game, and best tile in the board affected the end results of the game.</p>
<h2>How I Used the Monte Carlo Method in Jupiter, an AI to Beat 2048</h2>
<p>Let's start with a few definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board and Tiles</strong>: a 4x4 grid with tiles optionally placed on each grid spot</li>
<li><strong>Game State</strong>: a set of tiles on the board which represents the board at a specific time</li>
<li><strong>Game Score</strong>: the sum of all the tiles on the board</li>
<li><strong>Real Game</strong>: the game that is being played and shown on the browser, not a simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given game state, let's assume that four possible moves can be made: left, right, up, or down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are indeed cases where a certain move is not possible in a given game state. Removing impossible moves can be easily added to the algorithm later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Monte Carlo method, we can run a set of game simulations for every move.</p>
<p>For each possible move, the program simulates a set of simulations which <strong>start by playing the move for that set first</strong>. After that, the rest of the game can be played completely randomly until it is over.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, this algorithm looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>// assume Game object exists
// assume currentGame variable exists as the real game

const totalSimulations = 200; // 50 simulations are played for each move 

const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
possibleMoves.forEach((move) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>After all the simulations are completed, the program can gather the total final game scores of all the simulations, and average them for each move. We can then find the optimal move by optimizing for the highest final game score.</p>
<p>For example, if the simulations which started by playing left had an average final score of 250, whereas the ones which started by playing the other moves had an average final game score of 225, then left is the optimal move.</p>
<p>In this program, <strong>the optimal move is the one with simulations with the highest average final game score</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: I could have chosen to optimize for a different value such as the number of moves in the game.</strong></p>
<p>However, this would actually make no difference in how the algorithm functions, because the number of moves in the game almost exactly predicts the game score. In 2048, the new tile added after each game move is normally a 2 tile, but has a 10% chance of being a 4 tile instead. This means the expected value of the new tile is 2.2 (<code>2 × 90% + 4 × 10%</code>). The total value of tiles is also preserved after every tile combination (ex: 2 tile combined with another 2 tile gives a 4 tile). As a result, game score can be calculated by multiplying the expected value of the new tile by the number of moves in the game, or with this formula: <code>2.2 × (real game move count + average move count)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add this functionality of optimizing for highest score to our current code: add an array of total final scores for the simulations for each possible move, and choose the move with the highest value in that array to play like so:</p>
<pre><code>const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
const totalSimulations = 200;

let moveSimulationTotalScores = [0, 0, 0, 0];

possibleMoves.forEach((move, moveIndex) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
    moveSimulationTotalScores[moveIndex] += simulation.getScore();
  }
});

// make best move with highest total simulation scores
let topScore = Math.max(...moveSimulationTotalScores);
let topScoreIndex = moveSimulationTotalScores.indexOf(topScore);
let bestMove = possibleMoves[topScoreIndex];

currentGame.makeMove(bestMove);</code></pre>
<p>In the end, this algorithm is simple to implement given a well-written 2048 game class. In JavaScript, there are a number of performance upgrades that can be made, starting by adding concurrency with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> and pruning moves with very low final game scores.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this post, and found it useful in helping you understand and implement the Monte Carlo method in your own projects.</p>

								<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><em>A Logically investigation identifies a key QAnon figure as New Jersey resident Jason Gelinas. The investigation ties QAnon properties to a company owned by Gelinas, an information technology specialist who has held prominent positions at both Credit Suisse and Citigroup.</em></p>

<p><span>Ever since the shadowy figure known as Q made his first appearance on the 4chan imageboard in October of 2017, the author’s identity has remained a mystery. Since then, Q has posted thousands of ‘drops,’ converting legions of followers to the belief that Donald Trump is leading a global fight against a satanic cabal of child trafficking elites, commonly referred to in the QAnon world as the ‘Deep State’.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, Q’s posts would move from the 4chan forum to 8chan, and finally to its later iteration, 8kun. But these forums weren’t where most of Q’s followers would go to access the drops: most would find them neatly compiled on a site called QMap, now the main platform on which Q’s drops are published. For years it was believed that QMap was an endeavour that was independent of both the chan forums and the person or people posting Q’s drops, but recent discoveries concerning an IP address behind QMap raised questions as to whether Jim Watkins, the owner of 8chan and 8kun, an elusive figure in his own right, could also be Q. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>As some QAnon researchers have pointed out</span></a>, however, the story of Q’s operations does not end with Jim Watkins.</p>

<p>In the world of QAnon, the site qmap.pub is something of a sacred text. It’s a site designed to collect Q’s posts on other message boards and collate them in a searchable database; over the years, it has grown to include glossaries on themes, profiles on people named across the drops (handily sorted into ‘Evil’, ‘Traitor/Pawn’, and ‘Patriot’), and even a prayer wall.</p>
<p>Most followers of QAnon tend not to visit Q’s posts on 8kun and the ‘chan’ boards where they are initially posted (the vernacular used on those sites is deliberately exclusionary and newcomers are often put off). This makes qmap.pub a crucial port of call for all QAnon information and a major node in how the movement disseminates its lore. The site&nbsp;has been hitting over 10 million monthly users since April of this year.</p>
<p>The developer of QMap has been known only as ‘QAPPANON’ since the launch of the site in May of 2018. They have a successful Patreon where they regularly post and update their following on the running of the website. They pull in over 600 patrons and a $3,320 a month income - although there is a $4,000 a month target for ‘running costs’ of the website. In addition to the website, QMap also had an accompanying app on the Google Play Store (for $2.99) until <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-removes-qanon-apps-from-play-store-for-violating-terms/"><span>it was removed in May</span></a> this year as “harmful content”. The user QAPPANON is synonymous with qmap.pub, acting as its sole developer and mouthpiece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The QAnon community recognizes the importance of QAPPANON and how central QMap is to how the movement functions. In a recent campaign to deplatform QAPPANON from Patreon, QAnon power-influencer Praying Medic leapt to their defence, calling on his nearly 400,000 Twitter followers to help (and funnelling them towards QAPPANON’s Patreon). In addition, Praying Medic linked to the Patreon on his podcast, describing it as the “Qmap Patreon”.</p>

<h4><strong><span>Who is behind QAPPANON?</span></strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>It has been suspected that the owner of 8kun, Jim Watkins, is Q</span></a> and perhaps QAPPANON. A shared IP address for 8kun and qmap.pub was viewed as a significant link between Watkins and Q, placing him as a figure doing more than just hosting Q’s preferred method of communication. If Watkins was not in fact Q, his hosting of QMap suggested that at the very least, he could “become Q whenever he wanted”. When approached by Daily Dot, however, QAPPANON stated “they are ‘not associated with Watkins’ and that they moved to VanwaTech because “QMap suffers denial of service attacks regularly, hence the need for a content delivery network that could stop it.”</p>

<h4><strong><span>Logically Investigation into QAPPANON’s identity</span></strong></h4>
<p>Our investigation can reveal that QAPPANON is not Watkins, but instead a New Jersey man in his forties with prominent roles in technical analysis and IT security for the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QAPPANON’s email address was initially discovered during our investigation into QMap’s translation efforts and international reach. A now-deleted Facebook post allowed us to trace the email to a CNET&nbsp;download cache for the QMap app as well as a new app in development called Armor of God.</p>

<p>The email found here in the URL serves as a point of contact in a call for translators for qmap.pub. Importantly, the post here states that “<strong><em>Q</em></strong> is looking for someone” rather than “QMap is looking for someone.” As Watkins’s connection to QMap has resulted in speculation that he could be Q, the connection here should not be ignored. However, this may be the result of Shirley_is believing that Q speaks through qmap.pub. What this post <em>does </em>indicate is that QAPPANON is directly responsible for hiring translators for QMap, and therefore has employees.</p>
<p>An extraction of QAPPANON’s email address from the URL led to their developer profile and list of created apps on CNET. While the qmap app is well known at this point, Armor of God is relatively new, having been uploaded on the 18th June 2020.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Armor of God:</strong></span></h5>
<p>When investigating Armor of God, we were met with a bare sign-up screen. Attempts to register and investigate the platform both on desktop and mobile versions were met with login errors and no email to confirm registration or change passwords. This led us to believe that, while downloadable on app stores, the platform is not yet up and running.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the “get the Android app” link led to the Google Play store. Here, we can see that QAPPANON is listed as the profile responsible for uploading the app.</p>

<p>However, further down, we can see a different entity listed as the developer of Armor of God: Patriot Platforms.</p>

<p>Therefore, far from being a rogue developer creating QMap, QAPPANON has a company—and a company must be filed for.</p>

<p>Jason J. Gelinas, an information technology specialist from Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, whose CV lists prominent positions with both Credit Suisse and Citigroup, is the founder and sole employee of Patriot Platforms LLC, which is credited as the developer behind the QMap and Armor of God platforms. Gelinas’s home address is, in fact, a mere seven-minute drive from Patriot Platforms LLC’s listed P.O. box, also in Berkeley Heights; further investigation shows the connection between Gelinas’s personal WhatsApp and Patriot Platforms’ listed phone number.</p>

<p>So does that mean Gelinas <em>is </em>Q? No. In fact, it’s quite unlikely that someone such as Gelinas would have been involved in the very early (i.e. 4chan) days of Q. It does suggest, however, that after the success of the QMap platform since it was launched in 2018, a direct line was opened between Watkins and Gelinas, as well as Q (if we are to believe that Q is actually an independent third party and whether the Q from the early days is the Q of today). Indeed, as <span>creator and former owner of 8chan </span>Fred Brennan told Logically, Watkins essentially operates Vanwatech, the company hosting both 8kun and QMap, meaning that he can offer Gelinas free or negligible running costs for QMap, which then reframes the monthly income from Patreon.</p>
<p>So how close is all this to Q? In a nutshell, it’s closer than we’ve ever been. In fact, recent Q drops discussing the ‘Armor of God’ prayer more and more frequently coincide almost perfectly with attempts to launch the ‘Armor of God’ platform, giving this the feel of a coordinated PR campaign. Of course, that could be down to the tendency among Q’s followers to use and re-use the same language, but given the established connection between Gelinas and Watkins, the fact that this timing suggests a level of coordination should not be dismissed.&nbsp;</p></span>

  <article>
    <p>I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> a lot because I like to read books and want to find more books to read. This morning I was reading a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24451428">thread on hackernews</a> on <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">Sarah Manavis’s NewStatesman article</a> and it reminds me of how much I want, I yearn, for useful book recommendations. I think about this pretty much every time I open the goodreads page or app and hope that maybe this is the day they finally fix recommendations, so I figure I would capture some ideas I have for fixing their recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="i-love-goodreads">I Love Goodreads</h2>

<p>First, I love Goodreads. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9499790-brian">profile</a> says I joined May 2012. But I think that’s just whenever I started this profile and I have multiple, old profiles that I can’t find. My memory says I started using them soon after launch, but maybe I’m misremembering. But I’ve used them for a long time because I like to read books. I love browsing bookstores and libraries looking for new books. I experience joy finding a 50 or 100 year old book that I didn’t know about. One of my favorite things is reading a book so good that I can’t go to bed, or want to walk an extra mile. But that’s pretty rare for me, I’m lucky if I get one of those a year.</p>

<p>I have goodreads on my <a href="http://prepend.com/stack.xml">link stack</a> with the tag <a href="https://www.prepend.com/future/technology/2020/01/purdah.html">“purdah”</a> that I think means it is part of the stuff I do that uniquely identifies me.</p>

<p>Any time I get a recommendation from a friend or article or wherever, I add it to my “to read” shelf on goodreads. That helps me when I’m trying to buy a new book. So at least I can read through the 245 books that at least a past me wanted to read. This works well and is better than a vanilla list.</p>

<p>I also like seeing what my friends read and especially what they like or dislike. My friends have different tastes so it’s not as simple as just reading everything they read, but it helps a little. It’s one of the few places that I think facebook helps because at least I get to find out facebook friends who also are on goodreads. Every once in a while I find a new book through this feed, maybe once every 2 years. This might be because I don’t have many friends on goodreads (only 42), but I think it’s also because different people have different tastes in books.</p>

<p>I also like that goodreads will tell me when an author I’ve read releases a new book, or is having a book chat or something. Although I wish they would tell me when they come to a local book signing.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-as-i-see-it">The Problem As I See It</h2>

<p>This gets me to what I think is wrong and want to fix. I have read and rated 802 books with my average rating of 3.97. This makes sense as I’m probably only going to read books I think I’ll like, but I think this is the average goodreads rating, not the average of my ratings. Looking at what I rated, I’ve only given out 3 one stars, 42 two stars and tons of five stars. I keep scrolling on and on.</p>

<p>The user interface for goodreads is pretty bad- information is hard to find, layout is wasted, search doesn’t work well, hard to tell ads from user content- but that’s not what I’m talking about here. The main problem is in finding books that I will like. Maybe a UX overhaul from a great designer would help, but not that much. A craigslist interface would be great if they could just solve this one problem…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the single book that I will love most in all the world?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to find the next amazing experience. Books are great because they are cheap and portable. It’s not like wine where the best is more than I’ll ever pay. Or travel where a first class flight can cost $20k. If I can find a book, I can read it. And maybe someone I know can read it too.</p>

<p>If I can mix in more wonderful books, my life will be better. My family’s life will be better. Etc etc. Maybe this is the answer to world enlightenment. Probably not, but it will be great, I think.</p>

<p>When I click on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/recommendations">recommendations</a>, goodreads shows me five books that I don’t want to read. And it’s weirdly bad. Some of it makes since why it’s bad. They recommend different versions of books I’ve read. They recommend two different versions of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (one of my favorite books), but I guess they don’t know these are the same book. That’s just a waste of time and it’s weird that amazon isn’t smart enough to avoid duplicative books.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/goodreads_recommendations.png" alt="Screenshot of goodreads recommendations page"></p>

<p>But then they recommend stuff like Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>. This is perplexing because I only have one book that goodreads knows I’ve read from King and I rated it two stars. I don’t have any of his books in my “to read” list. Why would they recommend this book? Two of my friends rated it four stars and one even wrote a recommendation. So maybe that’s why. I’m aware of this book and don’t want to read it. But other books like <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight has no relationship to me. Why would they recommend this? I also know about this book and don’t want to read it. I wish there was some way to note books that I don’t want to read. Then at least they would stop showing me the same book over and over.</p>

<p>So it seems like goodreads is making pretty basic, rules-based recommendations. And they don’t help me pick new books.</p>

<h2 id="my-perfect-wish">My Perfect Wish</h2>

<p>My idea for an 11-star experience <sup id="fnref:brian_chesky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:brian_chesky">1</a></sup> in finding new books is that Goodreads knows me even better than I know myself and constantly recommends the perfect book. They recommend books that teach me, that spark enlightenment, that I hate but teach me to appreciate other books, books for when I want to be happy, and books for when I need to be sad. I want something like Jane from Ender’s Game who experiences everything I know but is fixated on finding me a good book. So the output of a book sommelier whose passion is seeing me sit there and love a book.</p>

<p>That’s what I would like.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-story-about-jeff-bezos">A Little Story About Jeff Bezos</h2>

<p>Once I was lucky enough to go to TED. It was great on so many levels, I highly recommend it and 2/3 of the cost was tax deductible. It was full of great stuff. I got to wait in the registration line in front of Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer, that was neat.</p>

<p>Anyway, one night Neil Gaiman was doing in a midnight ghost story reading in some neat four story townhouse type building <sup id="fnref:vancouver_club" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vancouver_club">2</a></sup> that was totally empty and spooky and a great place for the event. The reading was on the top floor and there was a huge crowd waiting for the single elevator in this place. The lights were off and there weren’t any staff around so it was maybe 100 people waiting to go up three at a time. So I looked around the corner and took the stairs. About 2 or 3 other people had the same idea so we started racing up the stairs to get to the top and avoid the crowds.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/vancouver_club.jpg" alt="Vancouver Club street view">
<em>photo by <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/2-joe-fox">Joe Fox</a></em></p>

<p>This building was awesome. It seemed 100 years old, rare in Vancouver, and as we went up the stairs we saw each floor. The stairwell opened up to a big room that could probably seat a 50 person wedding dinner. The lights were off, and someone had opened a few windows and the white, wispy curtains were blowing with a little breeze. Even though it didn’t feel like a breeze. I said “cool, haunted house” and stopped climbing the stairs to look around. The person next to me said “yeah, cool” and we started quickly running around checking out the empty room. We did this on the third floor too and me and this random person did quick 60 second explorations of this spooky house.</p>

<p>It all happened quickly. Maybe 3 minutes to go up the stairs, run around each floor, and get to the top. About halfway through I realized this random dude was Jeff Bezos. I thought that was neat. I’ve bought books from Amazon since 1995 and I’m pretty sure I telnetted into it to order some books (although maybe that was cdnow before they bought them), so it was cool to think that Jeff Bezos likes haunted houses and still likes exploring empty buildings.</p>

<p>We got to the top and went into the venue and were maybe the first 10 people. Comically got there maybe after two or three elevators full of people. We went to the front where Gaiman was setting up at the podium. I got a comfy chair right in the front about five feet in front of Gaiman. Jeff Bezos sat in the chair to my left. The chair on my right had Neil’s wife, Amanda Palmer, who was carrying a ukelele case. I didn’t know it was a ukulele case until she told me. She also said she might play, but she didn’t.</p>

<p>Gaiman finished setting up and came up to talk to Bezos. Bezos asked if Gaiman got the books he sent. Gaiman said he did and they were really great and he enjoyed reading them. It seemed like this was the most recent in a series of book shipments.</p>

<p>Aside from nerd joy from getting to witness this small talk of people who interest me, I thought, at the time and many times since,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How cool is it that Neil-freaking Gaiman is still finding new books that are great, and how cool would it be to get book recommendations from Jeff Bezos. I bet he has access to the best book recommendations in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, TED has something called the “TED book club” where they mail you this box of books a month before the conference. This was the closest I’ve come to my dream. They maybe sent 10 and 5 are still on my bookshelf. But not the shelf behind me, so I don’t remember them specifically. I’ll look them up one day.</p>

<p>That’s probably better than Jane making recommendations. Amazon had just bought goodreads a year earlier and I was hopeful that any day, goodreads would roll out a wonderful recommendation engine any day now.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-to-fix">What I Want to Do to Fix</h2>

<p>What I would like to do is to just get a data dump of mine and everyone on goodreads recommendations. I don’t need to know the identities, just to know what recommendations go with what individual. It would be neat to protect privacy and find individuals to potentially follow them on goodreads, but I think for the analysis I want to do, I don’t need to know the actual identities.</p>

<p>I think if I have this data, I could try to find people who rate a few hundred books like I have, then look at what books they’ve read the most, or books that they’ve rated highest. I think that would be a good signal that I might like it.</p>

<p>It would also be cool to see …</p></article></div></div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral">
                Line integrals</a> measure the extent to which a path agrees with a vector (directional) field.
                This provides an easy way to implement handwriting/tracing/gesture recognition.
                Although not as accurate as fancy ML methods, it still can recognize a wide
                varation in drawings with good accuracy and is versatile in application.
                However, this would not work for OCR applications as the direction of the strokes is an essential component of recognition.
           </p>

            <p>
                The line integral and total length of the path both contribute
                to the scoring. This allows "5" and "8" to be distinguished.
                The centroid of the path is used for adjusting position.
            </p>


            <p>
                Try drawing a number (1-9) in the box to see if it detects it.
            </p>

            
            <canvas id="main-canvas" width="220" height="220"></canvas>

                    <li> Clear the Canvas </li>
                    <li> Hold <b>SHIFT</b> and draw the character 5-8 times.
Try to keep the position the same as before. Naturally you will add a little variation.

                    </li><li> Optional: Press smooth a few times, then redraw a few more times. </li>
                    <li> Type in the string your glyph represents and <b>Save</b>.</li>
                </ul>

<li>*fixes in Getting Rid of Exceptions snippet 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was introduced to Rust in 2018 and has been enamored since. Rust is a system programming language, much like C++. Unlike C++ though, being relatively new, its language design is more modern and sophisticated. Writing with can feel more like writing TypeScript or Haskell. Not surprising since, despite being a language with a very minimum runtime and no GC, it derives many principles of functional programming such as immutability, type inference, higher-order functions, pattern-matching, etc. Over the course of tinkering things with Rust, I realized that writing Rust code makes me a better coder in other languages. This article will describe how my attempt to push the best in Rust's language design into TypeScript, my main language, without altering the language itself.</p>
<h2>Getting Rid of Exceptions</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes me the first time I learnt Rust is that there are no straightforward to write exception-like code in Rust. For someone used to exceptions after using many languages like C++, Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, this seems like an incomplete language. But Rust's lack of straightforward exception-like is actually thought out in advance.</p>
<p>Exceptions feel neat the first time you understand it. A thrown exception skips code execution into the <code>catch</code> block. By doing that you can ignore the rest of code in the function. The rest of the code in the function represents positive case, which may seem irrelevant when an error happens. Here's a piece of code:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{

}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{

}
</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>When <code>baz</code> is called it will throw an uncaught exception. By reading the code you know that <code>foo</code> throws an Error. Debugging this snippet is a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Now let's see another snippet. In the snippet below you are importing a function that can throw exception.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>callMe</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"somePackage"</span><span>;

</span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>callMe</span><span>();
}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>);
}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Compared to the first snippet, this one is harder to debug. It seems so because 1.) You don't know that <code>callMe</code> will throw an error or not. 2.) If it throws an exception you will not know what is the type of the exception. The more modular your code is, the harder it is to debug exceptions.</p>
<p>Why is that? If you noticed, in the first snippet, you know which function is throwing what because the <code>throw</code> and the caller are in one file. You don't need to switch files or even scroll that far to see what's wrong. Furthermore, unlike in other language like java, TypeScript exceptions are not typed. Because of that, unlike return values, the compiler could not deduce if a function will throw an exception or not, and that's bad. Combined with the fact that an exception propagates up until they are caught. That means exception can be n-level deep. The deeper it is from, the harder it is to debug it.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with statically-typed language, deferring what's supposed to be done in compile-time to run-time is bad. It hands over problems from the compiler to the user.</p>
<p>There are best practices for writing <code>try/throw/catch</code>, such as developers should throw <code>Error</code> objects instead of nullish values. But pushing everyone to apply best practice is not enough. You cannot assert control toward what is being written in external dependencies. There are not many points introducing law when enforcers are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Only when you have dealt with complex codebase you will understand why <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">we should not use exception for flow control</a>.</p>
<p>So how Rust does this? Rust encourages us to return errors instead of throwing it by providing a data type called <code>Result</code>. It is a tagged union which can either be <code>Ok(IdealData)</code> or <code>Err(NonIdealData)</code>. With this, a function can communicate the situation of a a call to its caller. For example:</p>

    <div data-language="rust">
      <pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span> () {</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"1"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>non_number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>number</span><span>);      </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>non_number</span><span>);  </span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>The function <code>.parse()</code> converts a <code>string</code> into <code>u8</code>. There are scenarios where parsing a <code>string</code> into a <code>u8</code> can result in failure, one is if the parsed string is not a numeric string. Because <code>.parse()</code> has a negative case, it returns <code>Result&lt;u8, _&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In Rust, <code>Err</code> does not jump like exceptions. Regardless the result is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>, the program will simply execute the next line. To handle the error the programmer has to check the return value is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. Early return is encouraged instead of throw. Rust has the <code>?</code> syntax which help making early returns more concise to write and read.</p>
<p>To adopt this feature to TypeScript, these are the important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors are returned instead of thrown</li>
<li>Errors types are known</li>
</ol>
<p>To simulate this behavior I am going to use tagged union too. I found this helpful library, <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">fp-ts</a>. It covers a great deal of functional programming experience by leveraging TypeScript's type system, but I will only use a small portion of it.</p>
<p><code>fp-ts</code> has <code>Either&lt;Left, Right&gt;</code> data type. It is like Rust's <code>Result</code> but more flexible. <code>Either</code> is a tagged union value container. <code>Either</code> is <code>Left</code> or <code>Right</code>, usually <code>Right</code> represents the ideal case and <code>Left</code> represents the non-ideal case but both can be used with any types. Below is the type definition of <code>Either</code>.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"left"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span> </span><span>};
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"right"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>What's cool about <code>Either</code> is that TypeScript actually supports deducing tagged union from its tag. For example inside this block <code>if (someEither._tag === "left") { }</code> TypeScript knows that <code>someEither</code> is a <code>Left</code>. If there's a <code>return</code> in that block, TypeScript will deduce that for the rest of the function block, <code>someEither</code> data type is <code>Right</code> and not <code>Either</code> anymore.</p>
<p>Let's make a called <code>tryCatch</code>. It is used to wrap a function into Either. <code>fp-ts</code> actually provides this function, but let's write it so that we know what's under the hood.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>tryCatch</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>onError</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unknown</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>());
</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>onError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));
</span><span>  </span><span>}
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>With our newly created <code>tryCatch</code>, creating a URL from string for example can be done like this.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tryCatch</span><span>(
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>),
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span>()
</span><span>  </span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Calling the function will look like this. The following snippet receives a string called <code>maybeUrl</code>. If <code>maybeUrl</code> is not a valid URL it returns an error. If the URL is not calling "example.com" it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns a promise from the <code>fetch</code> call.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>callThisMaybeUrlIfItIncludesExampleDotCom</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(
</span><span>  </span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
):</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>&lt;</span><span>any</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span>(</span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isLeft</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>left</span><span>;

</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>right</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>());

</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>));
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>There's a bit more line of codes here, but it is great that the TypeScript compiler now can deduce the error type and you have more control over the flow. You can even deduce if the variable <code>error</code> is <code>instanceof</code> <code>NotExampleDotComError</code> or <code>InvalidURLError</code> for cases like printing different errors.</p>
<h2>Safe TypeScript</h2>
<p>If you have played an early 2000s FPS games and tried to cheat, usually you will find the <code>noclip</code> command. It makes your avatar fly through walls and grounds. Sometimes, though, you take a shortcut and triggers the wrong script. When that happens, you can't finish your level and must restart to make it work again.</p>
<p>That's how I see Rust's <code>unsafe</code> and TypeScript's <code>any</code>.</p>
<p>These two features solve a similar problem. In Rust's case, it enables developers to temporarily unlock the power of handling raw pointer in case someone needs it. In TypeScript's case, someone might need to escape into the free-typed JavaScript world. And in both, it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure everything is fine before the program goes back to the safe system.</p>
<p>Unsafe to safe Rust is like <code>any</code> type to typed TypeScript. Unlike Rust, TypeScript's type only works until you compile it to JavaScript code. Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/conversion/try_from_try_into.html">TryInto/TryFrom</a> trait to convert raw data into a data type. But in TypeScript's case, if you inject a value that does not match TypeScript's type annotation, TypeScript can't do anything. This comes from TypeScript team's decision to make it only a thin layer on top of JavaScript. They thought it is best if for people to write TypeScript like JavaScript and the compilation result to look almost the same as the source code.</p>
<p>My approach for this would be securing all external hole of my application, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPIs, which consist of DOM, deserializable user inputs, fetch API, etc.</li>
<li>External Dependencies which returns <code>any</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was trying this approach, I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, created by the same author as <code>fp-ts</code>. This library helps me create a runtime type checker, or "codec" as the library's author calls it. Instead of writing:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>I wrote the codec for User:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>({</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>});
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>TypeOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>typeof</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Again, this is longer, but this is very useful if we want to secure those holes.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidTypeError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Fet…</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Traffic filtering is a common technique used to protect networks and hosts from malicious activity. The filtering can be done in the incoming and outgoing flows, better known as ingress and egress filtering. There are many examples of use cases for ingress filtering: mitigating DDoS attacks, avoiding SPAM, blocking access to services for specific geographic regions and so on.</p>
<p>One common application of egress filtering is to prevent applications and users from reaching remote hosts.
These kinds of filters are usually based on a large deny-list of IP address ranges, like <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/blog/reputation-block-lists-protecting-users-everywhere">Reputation Block Lists</a>. The technology used to perform this task has to be able to handle a high number of restricted hosts, up to millions in some cases.</p>
<p>Our friends at SAP asked us to perform a benchmark of the common Linux technologies available for this task. This blog post presents the methodology and results from benchmarking some of the Linux filtering technologies: eBPF, IP sets and iptables.</p>
<p><em>Update 2020-09-14:</em> we have received some great feedback and suggestions about other options to try, including BPF JIT optimization (that we left inadvertently disabled) and inline BPF map lookup. We will take a look at this and update this post as soon as possible - expected at the end of the month.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>We had the following goals going into this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reproducible benchmark framework that anyone else can download and use.</li>
<li>Evaluate the different mechanisms in the Linux networking stack to filter out a large amount of IP addresses and assess their scalability when the amount of IP ranges to block reaches 1 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>We aim to understand the cost of performing egress filtering based on the destination IP in a large set of IP ranges.</p>
<p>The scenario we consider is composed of a client and a server computer that communicate through an IP network. The egress filtering is performed on the client machine and there is no filtering performed on the server side.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/scenario.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>An egress filter has to perform a matching operation to understand if a packet can continue its way or has to be dropped. This operation could be costly if the number of blocked IPs is high. This kind of filter impacts the throughput of IP connections, it consumes extra CPU and increases the latency. We decided to take into consideration these metrics under the following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Latency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-filtering-mechanisms">Linux Filtering Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel provides different mechanisms to filter network packets. In this benchmark we considered the most known ones. iptables is the historical and probably more known filtering utility in Linux. IP sets support high speed matching for sets of specific types, like IP ranges for instance. eBPF is very flexible and customizable. The following section provides more details of how we used those mechanisms in our benchmark.</p>
<h3 id="ebpf">eBPF</h3>
<p>eBPF is a virtual machine built in the Linux kernel. In the networking scope, it allows the user to load programs that are executed each time a packet arrives or is sent out of a networking interface. Those eBPF programs can modify, redirect or drop the packets.</p>
<p>There are different types of networking eBPF programs, CGROUP_SKB for per-cgroup filtering, SCHED_CLS and SCHED_ACT for filtering at the traffic control level, and XDP for filtering at the network interface level.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/ebpf.svg">
</figure>
<p>In our scenario, we want to apply the same filtering regardless of the cgroup of the application generating the traffic. The traffic coming from non-local applications or forwarded traffic should be filtered as well. This makes filtering at the socket level unfit for our scenario. XDP programs can only be attached to the ingress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> path, removing it from consideration in our tests also. By process of elimination, we only consider eBPF programs attached to the traffic control layer.</p>
<p>Given that we want to keep the tests as simple as possible we decided to implement <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/blob/master/pkg/filters/bpf/datapath/bpf.c">our own</a>filtering program in eBPF that will be attached to the traffic control layer with a clsact qdisc. The clsact qdisc was introduced in Linux 4.5, it’s a pseudo qdisc that allows to attach eBPF programs in ingress and egress using the <a href="https://qmonnet.github.io/whirl-offload/2020/04/11/tc-bpf-direct-action/">direct-action</a> mode.</p>
<p>Our filter implementation uses an <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b95a5c4db09bc7c253636cb84dc9b12c577fd5a0">LPM map</a> to save the list of IP addresses to block. eBPF implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match">LPM</a> algorithm with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">digital tree</a>.</p>

<h3 id="iptables">iptables</h3>
<p>We tested the standard iptables implementation by adding DROP rules to the OUTPUT chain in the filter table. The rules we used have the following format</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -o eth0 -m comment --comment "benchmark" -j DROP</code></p>
<p>While implementing this filter we found that appending each rule independently was too slow and we had to use the <code>iptables-restore</code> utility to do it.</p>
<p>iptables uses a linear search algorithm for rule matching.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="ip-sets">IP Sets</h3>
<p>We performed the testing also with the <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/">IP sets</a> framework. We used an IP set of type <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/ipset.man.html#lbAZ"><code>hash:net</code></a> and linked it to iptables by using the following rule:</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -m set --match-set myset dst -m comment --comment benchmark -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>The IP address to check is hashed and the result of the hash is used as the index in a hash table. Each bucket of the hash table contains an array of networks for that hash. When an IP address is checked against an IP set of type “hash:net”, it is not known what network size will match. The IP set implementation hashes the IP address for all possible network sizes. For instance, if the IP to match is 1.2.3.4, it looks for 1.2.3.4/32, for 1.2.3.4/31 and so on until all the 32 possible network sizes have been tested.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="benchmark-set-up">Benchmark Set-up</h2>
<p>We used <code>iperf3</code> to measure the performance of TCP, UDP and the CPU usage. The standard <code>ping</code> utility was used to measure the latency. We tested with 10, 100, 1k, 10k, 100k and 1M rules and each test was run 5 times to get statistical robustness.</p>
<p>We used two bare metal servers - running on <a href="https://www.packet.com/">Packet</a> - as client and server machines. The specifications of such servers are:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">c2.medium.x86
1x AMD EPYC 7401P 24-Core Processor @ 2.0GHz
2x 120GB SSD
2x 480GB SSD
64GB RAM
2x 10Gbps
</code></pre></div><p>The exact versions of the tools we used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> by Kinvolk alpha (<a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/releases/#release-2605.0.0">2605.0.0</a>)</li>
<li>Linux kernel 5.4.59</li>
<li>iperf 3.0.7 (in a Docker container with the host network)</li>
<li>iptables v1.6.2</li>
<li>ipset v6.20.1, protocol version: 6</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/k8s-egress-filtering-benchmark">https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark</a> has all the tools and instructions to reproduce these tests.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="test-1---tcp-throughput">Test #1 - TCP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-tcp-linerate.svg">
</figure>
<p>The throughput graph shows that the test is reaching line rate, 10Gbps because we are using a single connection hence only one of the interfaces on the bonding is used in most of the cases. Only iptables with more than 10k rules is not able to handle that performance. From this test we can conclude that iptables doesn’t scale well after 100k, but unfortunately we cannot conclude anything from other tests as network performance is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>In order to stress the CPU more, we performed another test using UDP.</p>
<h3 id="test-2---udp-throughput">Test #2 - UDP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-udp.svg">
</figure>
<p>The goal of this test is to saturate the CPU. We used UDP packets and the <code> -b 10G</code> parameter to try to reach line rate. The graph shows that none of the cases reaches the 10Gbps line rate, it’s good for this test because it means the network is not the bottleneck anymore.</p>
<p>We can see that iptables does not scale well beyond 1k rules and that IP sets are a bit faster than eBPF on the clsact qdisc with a high number of rules.</p>
<h3 id="test-3---cpu-usage">Test #3 - CPU usage</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/cpu.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used <code>iperf</code> with a target bandwidth of 1Gbps (<code>-b 1G</code>) to avoid saturating the CPU and be able to compare the CPU usage with the different filters. We take the CPU usage reported by <code>iperf</code> that includes all the applications running on the host. From the above graph we can see that the CPU usage with iptables increases when using more than 1k rules. The CPU usage with eBPF and IP sets filters stays almost constant showing a bit higher usage in the eBPF case.</p>
<h3 id="test-4---latency">Test #4 - Latency</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/latency.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used the standard Linux ping utility to measure the latency with the <code>-i 0.001</code> and <code>-c 1000</code> parameters, sending 1000 pings at a 1 millisecond interval. The above graph shows that the latency is not affected by the number of rules in the eBPF and IP sets filters, it’s ~27µs in those cases. On the other hand, it increases linearly with the number of rules for the iptables case.</p>
<h3 id="test-5---setup-time">Test #5 - Setup Time</h3>
<p>This test aims to measure the time it takes to install the filtering rules on the system. It doesn’t take into consideration fixed times like loading the eBPF program, creating the IP sets but instead focuses on measuring the time it takes to update the rules themselves and how it changes with the number of rules.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/setup.svg">
</figure>
<p>The above graph shows that the time required to set up the rules in all the filters increases linearly with the number of rules.</p>
<p>With 100.000 IPs, the setup time is still less than one second. For 1 million IPs, the setup time is less than 10 seconds. This shows that in practice, all 3 methods have an acceptable setup time.</p>
<p>The setup time is very dependent on the benchmark implementation rather than being inherent to the filtering method. Each filtering method could be optimised in the benchmark code if it were deemed necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the bpf filter: the benchmark performs one bpf() system call for every IP. From Linux 5.6, it is possible to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aa2e93b8e58e18442edfb2427446732415bc215e">perform several updates in a eBPF map with a single bpf() call</a>.</li>
<li>For the iptables and IP sets filters, the benchmark executes external commands and feeds each IP range individually over a pipe. We could avoid that by communicating the list to the kernel using the Netlink protocol directly. There are <a href="https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink/search?q=ipset&amp;type=Issues">some attempts</a> to implement IP Sets support in Golang with the vishvananda/netlink library.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, the reader should be cautious before comparing the setup time of one filter to another. This should not be interpreted as one method being better than another but rather to show expected setup performance and that setup time is unlikely to be a problem for any filtering method.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>In my journey learning 9 languages over the years, I tried all sorts of different methods to make my learning more effective. Here are some of the notable approaches, along with why they work (or don't work). It </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>will be a long learning journey</span></a> <span>, I hope this article will make yours more fun and effective. </span></p> <p><span>Let's jump right in.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Moving to the Target Country</span></h3></p> <p><span>In my experience learning a language, immersion is powerful. Being in a country where your target language is spoken is ideal. Your learning becomes always on, even if you don't realize it. </span></p> <p><span>I moved to Tokyo and worked at an all-Japanese company a few years ago. At the beginning I knew very little Japanese. But with this sink-or-swim approach and the daily immersion, I became comfortable with basic conversations within three months.</span></p> <p><span>Now, it is not always possible to just pack up and move to a different place. Read on for other tips I tested from my own experience. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Language Exchange Meetups</span></h3></p> <p><span>You can only get so good at speaking a language without talking to native speakers. Language exchange groups are a great way to get that conversational practice. In a typical event, you would get paired up/grouped with native speakers of your target language, who are themselves looking to level up on your native tongue. </span></p> <p><span>For half of the time, the group would converse in one language, and then switch to the other language half-way. If you live in a major city, there are usually quite a few of these groups for the common languages. </span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank"><span>Meetup</span></a> <span> is a great place to look for these events. This is an effective way to practice in your home city, or when you are already in your target country. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Online Language Exchange</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you are unable to attend in-person meetups, online language exchange can be effective as well. Though in-person conversations would always feel more organic, you still get the instant feedback and practice with online language exchange calls. </span></p> <p><span>I have made a few friends along the way, while practicing my German, French, and Japanese. I previously had a pleasant experience using </span> <a href="https://www.italki.com/" target="_blank"><span>iTalki</span></a> <span>, where I could easily find language partners and schedule 1-1 Skype calls with them. It was entirely free. But at the time of writing, it appears they may have removed the free partner option.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Learning Entire Phrases</span></h3></p> <p><span>I found it effective to memorize entire sentences, and pull them out when I need to. There are several benefits to this. When you are communicating in realtime, having phrases already memorized can reduce your stumbling. It can make you appear fluent and keep the conversation flowing. This also makes you feel more comfortable, knowing what to say or how to respond in a given situation.</span></p> <p><span>These familiar phrases serve as important anchors as well, for learning about the structure of the language, and for easily swapping out components to adapt to new situations. For example, after memorizing the phrase "After a few months of travelling, I am happy to finally be able to work with everyone", you can substitute some of the words and use it in a new scenario.</span></p> <p><span>Phrase books can be somewhat useful for this purpose, though it can sound scripted and unnatural. What feels more natural is writing down and remembering the response of native speaker in a real-life situation or in a movie.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Movies/Shows in Your Target Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>Movies and TV shows are a great source of natural-sounding phrases (though overly dramatic sometimes) to add to your knowledge bank. This is great for a number of reasons: </span></p> <p><li><span>You can usually figure out what the movie is about (especially if you first watch it in your native language).</span></li></p> <p><li><span>It is enjoyable, which means you will stick with it</span></li></p> <p><li><span>You get to learn about the culture behind your target language</span> <strong> </strong> <span>as well.</span></li></p> <p><span>And if you are watching it on TV, I find that even the commercials in your target language are interesting. Not only is it good practice, you get a better sense of what kinds of products local people buy and the messaging that appeals to them. With the growing selection of international shows/movies on Netflix, along with audio and/or subtitles, this is a fun and easy way to make progress.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Interviews with Subtitles and Translations</span></h3></p> <p><span>In addition to movies/shows, interviews are the perfect content for getting exposure to natural conversations, where people use casual everyday language. </span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/magauchsein" target="_blank"><span>Easy Languages</span></a> <span> on YouTube is hands down one of my favourite language resources. They interview people on the streets on a different topic each episode, and provide subtitles in the original language + English. Over the years, they have built up an amazing collection of content in many (!) languages.</span></p> <p><span>Here's a taste of their content for German learners: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLoatpfE7VM?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Passive Background Looping</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is one of the most effective hacks I developed to maximize my time spent learning a language. As I work, I would put on a familiar track of native speakers talking (much of the time it would be Easy Languages) in the ground. This way, I can get a lot of listening practice without spending much time. By picking content that you are already familiar with, you already know what is being talked about. And the looping gets you more "reps" for each phrase. It also helps you memorize entire phrases that you can use with ease later.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Podcasts </span></h3></p> <p><span>This one can be tricky. I have tried quite a few podcasts and many podcast formats aren't that conducive to learning a foreign language. Either I don't understand what's going on, or there is too much repeating over the often dry content. But for Japanese learners, I highly recommend </span> <a href="https://bilingualnews.libsyn.com/" target="_blank"><span>Bilingual News</span></a> <span> hosted by Michael and Mami. It features the hosts talking about interesting topics in the news, with Michael speaking only English and Mami speaking only Japanese. The conversation always moves forward and remains engaging, and you can usually easily fill in the words you missed from the context. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Ask a Native Speaker "How do I say X?" Wherever Possible</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you have friends (or better yet, roommates) from other countries, you can definitely get some practice in as you hang out. When you are trying to say something, why not learn to say it in your target language too? Anytime is learning time! You'll remember it much better than other methods because the learning takes place in real-life expeirences. I used to worry this may come off as annoying, but in my experience most people are happy to help, and appreciate the ernest effort you make to understand their language/culture. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Changing Your Phone's Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>One easy way to squeeze out an extra bit of language immersion is to simply change your mobile phone to your target language. Doing so should automatically update the language in all your apps as well. Since you likely already know how to navigate through most apps anyway, in most cases you can guess the meaning of new words that you don't yet know. With this, even Facebook notifications become good practice. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Taking classes</span></h3></p> <p><span>I have never been a fan of learning a language in a classroom, having taken Russian, French and Mandarin classs. This one is a bit of a hit or miss. The classroom environment has always felt a bit too artificial for this purpose. Typically, there is also limited practice, limited individual attention (and hence </span> <em>feedback</em> <span>). And the separation between the classroom learning context and the real-life situations makes it hard to apply the knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>That said, there are some amazing teachers out there who excel at teaching and building curriculum. And for some people, the structure of learning in a group guided by a competent instructor is just what they need. For Chinese learners, </span> <a href="https://www.excelmandarin.com/" target="_blank"><span>Excel Mandarin</span></a> <span> is an example of educators who have created an effective learning system for their students. Though not from my personal experience, I have heard nothing but positive reviews about these folks. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Duolingo</span></h3></p> <p><span>There was a time when I would have a long-running practice streak on the popular free app </span> <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank"><span>Duolingo</span></a> <span>. I would use the app daily, and almost completed the curriculum for Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and German. I felt great. I felt engaged. I felt like I was making progress. But that's the dangerous part about apps like these that try to "gamify" the language learning process. it makes you feel productive, even if it may not reflect reality. </span></p> <p><span>It is all too easy to slip into auto-pilot mode, where you just rush to the finish line of each exercise. This is similar to how one would "speed read" a book in an hour and retain nothing from it. The app also trains you to get used to the machine-generated bad pronunciation, which is counter-productive for your listening skills. On the bright side, Duolingo can be helpful for exposure to new words, and adding some structure to your learning, especially if you are not following a curriculum or textbook.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reading Textbooks</span></h3></p> <p><span>Reading a textbook for the purpose of language learning is perhaps the best way to learn the formal structure of a language. But it is not effective for conversational purposes. Grammar rules are clean, but conversational languages are messy. Similar to the discussion above about taking classes, textbooks tend to give a similar passive understanding of rules, as opposed to the ability to apply that knowledge in real-time. </span></p>  <p><span>The best approach is the one you actually take and follow through with. One that fits your learning objectives and learning style. The more you can align your learning with your intrinsic motivation, the more likely it is that it will stick. </span></p>

<p>After the sudden and miraculous shift to remote work in March – the office fightback has well and truly begun.</p>



<p>Four months ago I wrote that – surprisingly- there was no fightback from technophobe hold-outs barricading themselves into their offices. They simply packed up their laptop and went home with the rest of us. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank">How </a><a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/">premature</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank"> I was</a>. </p>

<p>If you thought that 2020 couldn’t get any crazier – it seems some people really are suggesting that businesses should alter their workplace strategies in order to save…sandwich shops.</p>



<p>OK, I’m exaggerating for effect. But there really has been a hand brake applied to the move to remote/hybrid working , or my favoured term,<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/work-futures/the-future-is-minimum-office-not-zero-office-821928abdba2" target="_blank"> minimum office</a></em> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/go-back-work-risk-losing-job-major-drive-launched-get-people/" target="_blank">article in the Daily Telegraph</a>&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that employees who continue to work at home will be more vulnerable to redundancy, with bosses finding it far easier get rid of people they don’t physically see.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1290987043829489666?s=20" target="_blank">Kirstie Allsopp</a> led the anti-remote work charge on Twitter, suggesting that if your job can be done from home, it can be done from anywhere in the world. Who would have thought that a couple of months of working in shorts and a T-Shirt has made us more susceptible to being replaced by less expensive folk in India, Myanmar and China? </p>



<p>A debate that is framed around saving sandwich shops and an already dying high street isn’t helpful or progressive. Cynically I might suggest the real subtext here is about propping up commercial property investment portfolios. Realistically though, we won’t see anything like a return to the same number of offices, and although few will shed tears for commercial real estate investors many small businesses will suffer a big hit and go out of business unless they can pivot very rapidly.</p>



<p>Clearly there are two groups emerging, those who are desperate for the pandemic to be viewed as a temporary event before everything returns to ‘normal’ and those embracing the true long term disruption that is occurring.</p>



<p>Thank heavens then for more balanced thinkers like Tom Cheesewright who has an uncanny ability to pan back and take the long view. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tomcheesewright.com/were-still-human/" target="_blank">Writing on his website</a> about the current over-confidence in the possibilities for remote working he says:</p>



<p><em>“There is something different about being there, in person, with all of your senses engaged. It’s what I called a few years ago, ‘<a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/the-unbeatable-bandwidth-of-being-there/">the unbeatable bandwidth of being there</a>‘. What gets transmitted and received through the screen and headset, mediated by a million miles of fibre optic cable, is not the full experience of meeting. Nor does it allow for all the things that happen around those meetings. <a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/aftershocks-and-opportunities/">I’ve talked at length about the need for peer support, the subtler parts of staff training, and the mutual inspiration that happens when you’re sharing a physical space</a>.”</em></p>



<p>I’m a remote working, or at least a minimum office, enthusiast. I’ve written on this site for years about the worst aspects of office life and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2014/07/31/why-the-death-of-the-office-cant-come-too-soon/" target="_blank">the most popular post on here applauds its impending doom</a>.  Six years on though I’d admit it’s a deeply flawed argument. The idea that constant interruptions and back to back meetings were a symptom of being in a corporate building has been well and truly busted by…Microsoft Teams. </p>



<p>In truth the problem with work is not the tools or the physical location, but <a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/01/03/ending-our-obsession-with-leadership/">the obsession with leadership</a> , an undue focus on work about work, an overbearing hierarchy and the lack of true digitisation of the enterprise. Deeper, more complex problems.  </p>



<p>It’s ironic that it has taken a pandemic to reveal what was good about the office. “The things that happen between meetings” that Tom writes about reveal our innate desire for human contact – the need to get <em>our senses fully engaged</em>. Wasteful? Quite often. But we dismiss this at our peril. It may seem logical that workplace chatter stifles productivity, but studies show the opposite to be true. </p>



<p>A narrow focus on efficiency in the workplace and a flawed view of what makes people productive is similarly regressive and likely to drag people back to the old normal. As Stowe Boyd writes the backlash against minimum office is in full flow , as detailed in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-start-to-think-remote-work-isnt-so-great-after-all-11595603397?mod=trending_now_pos1">Companies Start to Think Remote Work Isn’t So Great After All</a>, as executives want to get people back in the office:</p>



<p>“<em>An increasing number of executives now say that remote work, while necessary for safety much of this year, is not their preferred long-term solution once the coronavirus crisis passes.</em></p>



<p><em>“There’s sort of an emerging sense behind the scenes of executives saying, ‘This is not going to be sustainable,’” said Laszlo Bock, chief executive of human-resources startup Humu and the former HR chief at Google. No CEO should be surprised that the early productivity gains companies witnessed as remote work took hold have peaked and leveled off, he adds, because workers left offices in March armed with laptops and a sense of doom</em>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s simply we haven’t yet matched our colleagues roles, and their specific work preferences, within our existing organisational design never mind considered a future state. Working from home (managed and supported appropriately) <strong>can</strong> be more productive than going into the office.</p>

<ol><li>Lockdown helps us focus on the work that really matters. We are spending 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners.</li><li>Lockdown helps us take responsibility for our own schedules. We do 50% more activities through personal choice — because we see them as important — and half as many because someone else asked us to.</li><li>During lockdown, we view our work as more worthwhile.&nbsp; We rate the things we do as valuable to our employer&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to ourselves. The number of tasks rated as tiresome drops from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others drops from 41% to 27%.</li></ol>



<p>The key phrase here is: <em>managed and supported appropriately</em>. Certainly managers need to reinvent themselves as mentors to this style of working and then – forgive me – get the hell out of the way. </p>



<p>The office as the default way of working is dead. But the office itself isn’t dead. With working from home, what we gain in work-life balance we might lose in innovation and creativity. There are people who could directly challenge that sentence but I suspect they will come from highly mature companies who have fully mastered the remote working learning curve. Many of us are still at the stage of doing what we did in the office , just remotely. The timorous amongst us may use the lack of productivity net gains as a reason to regress rather than push through the ‘pain barrier’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/07/11/nirvana-or-business-as-usual-navigating-the-new-future-of-work/" target="_blank">as Matt Mullenweg describes it.</a> </p>



<p>We can do so much better, for ourselves, our customers and society if we stop being so frightened or so certain of the future. </p>



<p>We are going to have fewer offices and spend more time at home. </p>



<p>Our efforts would be a lot better spent improving the experience and outcomes of both rather than arguing about preserving a status quo whose time has truly run out. </p>



<p><em>The office versus remote work?</em> It’s not a binary choice we need to make. </p>



<p>The best thing you can do in any period of change is to bet on neither black or white. The future will be made up instead of shades of grey where few things are certain and <em>the best you can do to prepare is to be endlessly adaptable</em>. </p>

        <p><span>I</span>t was in 1752 that Linnaeus gave jellyfish the alternative name â€˜medusaâ€™ from the Greek myth of the same name. The term was well chosen. The bell of a jellyfish is a reminder of the head of the Gorgon sister, with its tentacles, like snakes, substituting for hair. Both the mythical Medusa and her animal counterpart were capable of causing paralysis and even death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the version of the Medusa myth found in Ovidâ€™s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Medusa, one of three Gorgon sisters, was originally depicted as a great beauty whose attractive powers did not go unnoticed. Her hair was only transformed into serpents by the goddess Athena as a punishment. Medusa had been ravished by the sea god Poseidon in Athenaâ€™s own temple and because the temple had been defiled, Athena gave Medusa the power to change any human who looked upon her into stone. Perseus, the son of Zeus and half-brother of Athena, was asked by Polydectes to secure the head of Medusa. Instead of gazing on the Gorgon sister and risking being petrified, Perseus used the reflection on his shield to guide him while removing Medusaâ€™s head with his sword. From her decapitated torso sprang two children, Pegasus, a flying horse, and Chrysaor, a warrior with a golden sword. The transformative powers of Medusaâ€™s head were retained following its separation from the body and when Perseus laid down the head on the seashore, the escaping blood was said to be the origin of red coral (intriguing, knowing the close relationship that exists between jellyfish and coral).&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Caravaggioâ€™s depiction of Medusa, painted towards the end of the sixteenth century, echoes her destructive yet beautiful power while another painting, initially thought to be by Leonardo da Vinci, was to inspire a famous poem by Shelley:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>â€™Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror; <br>For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare <br>Kindled by that inextricable error,<br>Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air <br>Become a [ ] and ever-shifting mirror.<br>Of all the beauty and the terror there-
A womanâ€™s countenance, with serpent locks, <br>Gazing in death on heaven from those wet rocks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A more up-to-date version of Medusa is seen in Frank Mooreâ€™s painting <em>To Die For</em>. It features the model Kate Moss, her severed head alive with serpents. It was a painting commissioned by Gianni Versace, who never saw it since he was killed before Moore had completed the work. Moore himself died prematurely of AIDS in 2002, aged 48. The picture featured in an exhibition in New York called <em>Toxic Beauty: The Art of Frank Moor</em>e.<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_805b7becd4587e52023de0fe709ad787.jpg" alt="Medusa_by_Carvaggio"><figcaption><span>A ceremonial shield depicting the severed head of Medusa, painted in the late 16th century by Caravaggio. </span><br><span>Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In her poem â€˜Medusa,â€™ Sylvia Plath successfully combines the mythical creature and the sea animal. Written shortly before her own death, it portrays her mother, with whom she had a difficult relationship, as a destructive monster clinging to her by a â€˜cableâ€™, akin to a jellyfish tentacle, and intent on controlling, indeed paralysing, her. It is as though Plath felt the need to exorcize her mother from her life in order to achieve some emotional distance, as well as to afford her greater freedom to write and compose. Plath could be said to have used the device of the snake-haired Gorgon to describe her own internal image of a monstrous mother. Ironically, her mother shared her first name with that of a common genus of jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Freud came to regard Medusaâ€™s head as a symbol of castration. In a short, posthumously published essay, â€˜Das Medusenhauptâ€™, he equates decapitation with being castrated, arguing that when a boy views female genitalia for the first time he suddenly realizes the possession of a penis cannot be taken for granted, leading to a specific anxiety about castration. In the same way, glimpsing the Medusaâ€™s head causes a male observer to be struck dumb, on the one hand fascinated by what he sees and, on the other, paralysed with fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Medusa myth, with its built-in ambiguity (deadly but fascinating), has served to reinforce our own ambivalence towards this sea creature. It may also have created a reluctance on the part of scientists to work with these animals. There is however no doubting that, when seen in its natural environment, the jellyfish displays that other, more positive quality, an ability to hold our attention, indeed to fascinate. This is explored in Marianne Mooreâ€™s poem â€˜A Jelly-fishâ€™, where the creature exerts â€˜a fluctuating charmâ€™.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jellyfish escape as quickly as they appear and while they may be allowed to touch us, they themselves often resist capture. They appear both alluring and elusive. The very nature of their movement contributes to their ethereal beauty, and where better to observe this than in a tropical lagoon? The Raja Ampat islands off West Papua boast several. Others can be found on the Kakaban islands off Borneo. In both places the jellyfish have lost their ability to sting humans, making it possible to appreciate their delicacy and movement in safety. In the Ampat islands, the lagoons are connected to the ocean through underwater channels that limit the entry and exit of seawater. In addition, the water there is stratified into an oxygen-rich surface layer where the jellyfish live and a deeper layer, devoid of oxygen, where they are absent. Two genera of jellyfish, the so-called golden jellyfish, <em>Mastigias</em>, and the moon jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>, coexist there. The species of <em>Mastigias</em> found in Ampat has lost the spots on its bell and oral arms and the marine biologist Michael Dawson believes this indicates a new subspecies has evolved there with no appreciable sting, presumably as the result of geographical isolation.</p>
<p>The slow, seemingly directionless pulsation of jellyfish can have a calming effect and lends itself to hospital and general practice waiting rooms, a feature as yet unexploited. Its languid movement calls into question how efficient this is as a means of locomotion. Work done at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts is providing the answer. It seems that jellyfish have a special way of recapturing some of the energy expended on each swimming stroke. When a medusa contracts its bell, it creates two vortex rings. The first is shed in its wake, propelling the animal forwards. The second, during the relaxa- tion phase, rolls under the bell. This second vortex ring spins faster than the first and, as it does so, sucks in water which pushes up against the underside of the bell, giving the jellyfish a second- ary boost. It is a technique that works only at slow speeds and when the body size is small. The conclusion reached by Brad Gemmell and his team at Woods Hole is that a jellyfish expends less energy in travelling a given distance than any other marine animal so far studied. Its efficiency, however, comes at a price, namely low speed and virtually no maneuverability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the humble jellyfish as a primitive automaton, unable to modify its movement and behaviour. By attaching accelerometers to the barrel jellyfish, <em>Rhizostoma pulmo</em>, it has been shown that it is able to orientate its swimming in relation to the direction of the tides. When the tide withdraws from the shore, this particular jellyfish orientates itself so as to swim against the current. When the tide flows towards the shore, it also swims in a consistent direction, either with or against the current, depending on the depth of the water. This appears to be a mechanism for keeping jellyfish together as a swarm and avoiding their becoming stranded on the shore.</p>

</center>
<p>The fascination that jellyfish engender in us deepens when we consider recent discoveries about another aspect of their behaviour, one which mirrors our own. In the so-called upside- down jellyfish, <em>Cassiopea</em>, it is possible to witness periods of diminished activity resembling sleep from which the creature is only slowly aroused (reminiscent of our own behaviour when sleep deprived). Like us, this jellyfish becomes â€˜sleepyâ€™ when exposed to the naturally occurring chemical melatonin. Sleep, or at least periods of cyclical inactivity, would appear to have arisen early on in evolution, well in advance of the possession of advanced nervous systems.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Earlier in the book, I stressed how the anatomy and the life cycle of jellyfish proved to be more complex than previously imagined. The behaviour of jellyfish in their natural habitat is proving equally complicated. We know that migrations of jellyfish in a horizontal direction are guided by the position of the sun. The golden jellyfish in Palau, for example, follow the sunâ€™s arc across the sky. Before sunrise, they cluster at the western end of Jellyfish Lake. With the dawn, they swim in an easterly direction towards the light, following the sun until they reach the eastern shore. As the sun continues towards the western horizon, the jellyfish reverse their course and return to the western shore to await the new day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vertical migration also occurs. Using echo sounders in a deep Norwegian fjord, the movements of individual helmet jellyfish,&nbsp; <em>Periphylla</em> <em>periphylla</em>, were monitored. This species of jellyfish segregates itself into assemblages. Each assemblage shows a different preference as far as vertical positioning in the water is concerned. Night-time groups congregate for the purpose of feeding and reproduction while other groups form for brief periods in other situations, only to disperse and then re-group. It has been suggested that this represents a type of social behaviour and …</p></article></div>

<p>Spyware written for educational institutions to flex their muscles of control over students and their families when learning from their home computer is still, categorically, spyware.</p>



<p>Depending on your persuasion, the previous sentence sounds like either needless pedantry, or it reads like tautology. But we need to be clear on our terms.</p>



<ol><li>Educational spyware is still spyware.</li><li>Spyware is categorized as a subset of malware.</li></ol>



<p>When vulnerabilities are discovered in malware, the normal rules of <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">coordinated disclosure</a> are out of scope. Are we clear?</p>







<p>So let’s talk about Proctorio!</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anyone unfamiliar with it, Proctorio is a browser extension used to eliminate cheating through intense surveillance techniques. It records the computer screen while you take the exam to ensure you don’t look anything up. However, it’s more than that.

</div><figcaption>The entire thread is unrolled <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1301360994044850182.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I won’t go into the details of Proctorio or why it’s terrible for (especially disadvantaged) students. Read Cassie’s Twitter thread for more context on that. Seriously. I’m not gonna be one of those guys that <em>talks over</em> women, and neither should you.</p>



<p>What I am here to talk about today is these dubious claim about the security of their product:</p>







<h2 id="zero-knowledge">Zero-Knowledge Encryption? OMGWTFBBQ!</h2>



<p>In cryptography, there are a class of algorithms called Zero-Knowledge Proofs. In a Zero-Knowledge Proof, you prove that you possess some fact without revealing any details <em>about</em> the fact.</p>



<p>It’s kind of abstract to think about (and until we’re ready to talk about Pedersen commitments, I’m just going to defer to <a href="https://openprivacy.ca/work/swisspost-scytl-evoting/">Sarah Jamie Lewis</a>), but the only thing you need to know about “Zero Knowledge” in Cryptography is that the output is a boolean (True, False).</p>



<p>You can’t use “Zero Knowledge” <em>anything</em> to encrypt. So “Zero-Knowledge Encryption” is a meaningless buzzword.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a cryptographer, I would like details on how on Earth it is using zero knowledge proofs in this situation. In all likelihood they're not doing what "zero knowledge" usually means, which quite frankly has me more worried about the security, not less.</p>— Buchberger's algorithm fan account (@SchmiegSophie) <a href="https://twitter.com/SchmiegSophie/status/1304407483658592256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>So what are they actually describing when they say Zero Knowledge Encryption?</p>







<p>Okay, so they’ve built their own key distribution system and are encrypting with AES-GCM… and shipped this in a Chrome extension. But before we get to that, look at this <strong>Daily Vulnerability Tests</strong> claim.</p>

<p>Running Nessus (or equivalent) on a cron job isn’t meaningful metric of security. At best, it creates alert fatigue when you accidentally screw up a deployment configuration or forget to update your software for 4+ years. (Y’know, like JsZip 3.2.1, which they bundle.)</p>



<p>A dumb vulnerability scan isn’t the same thing as a routine (usually quarterly) penetration test or a code audit. And if you’re working in cryptography, <em>you better have both</em>!</p>



<h2 id="vulnerability">Timing Leaks in Proctorio’s AES-GCM Implementation</h2>



<p>If you download version 1.4.20241.1.0 of the Proctorio Chrome Extension, run <code>src/assets/J5HG.js</code> through a JS beautifier, and then look at its contents, you will quickly realize this is a JavaScript cryptography library.</p>



<p>Since the “zero knowledge” encryption they’re so proud about uses AES-GCM, let’s focus on that.</p>



<p>Proctorio’s AES-GCM implementation exists in an object called <code>dhs.mode.gcm</code>, which is mildly obfuscated, but contains the following functions:</p>



<ul><li><code>encrypt()</code> – Encrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>decrypt()</code> – Decrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>aa()</code> – GHASH block multiplication</li><li><code>j()</code> – XOR + GMAC utility function</li><li><code>O()</code> – Called by encrypt() and decrypt(); does all of the AES-CTR + GMAC fun</li></ul>



<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a>, just know this: <a href="https://cryptologie.net/article/361/breaking-https-aes-gcm-or-a-part-of-it/">Timing leaks</a> can be used to leak your GMAC key to outside applications, which completely breaks the authentication of AES-GCM and opens the door to chosen-ciphertext attacks.</p>



<p>So is their implementation of AES-GCM constant-time? Let’s take a look at <code>aa()</code>:</p>


<pre title="">aa: function(a, b) {
  var c, d, e, f, g, h = dhs.bitArray.ba;
  for (e = [0, 0, 0, 0], f = b.slice(0), c = 0; 128 &gt; c; c++) {
    for (
      (d = 0 !== (a[Math.floor(c / 32)] &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; 31 - c % 32)) &amp;&amp; (e = h(e, f)),
        g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3]),
        d = 3;
      d &gt; 0;
      d--
    )
      f[d] = f[d] &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 | (1 &amp; f[d - 1]) &lt;&lt; 31;
    f[0] &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1,
    g &amp;&amp; (f[0] ^= -520093696)
  }
  return e
},
</pre>


<p>This is a bit obtuse, but this line leaks the lowest bit of <code>f</code> with each iteration: <code>g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3])</code>.</p>



<p>Since <code>f</code> gets bitwise right-shifted 128 times, this actually leaks the bit of every value of <code>f</code> in each block multiplication, since the execution of <code>(f[0] ^= -520093696)</code> depends on whether or not <code>g</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's something I have to get off my chest. If you really need to, just read the TLDR and listen to the Justin Bieber parody posted below. If you’re confused by the lingo, the rest of the post will fill in any gaps.</p><div><p>TL;DR: Benchmarketing, the practice of using benchmarks for marketing, is bad. Consumers should run their own benchmarks and ideally open-source them instead of relying on an internal and biased report.</p><p>Enjoy the song I wrote about this silly practice.</p></div><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSy8V-R0_Zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For the longest time, I have wondered what is the point of corporations, specifically in the database sectors, running their own benchmarks. Would a company ever have any incentive to post results from a benchmark that didn't show its own system winning in at least the majority of cases? I understand that these benchmarks have become part of the furniture we come to expect to see when visiting any hot new database's website. I doubt anybody in the public domain gains much insight out of these results, to begin with, at least nothing they weren't expecting to see. </p><p>Now to be clear, I am in no way indicating that companies running their own internal benchmarks to analyze their own performance in comparison to their competitors is a bad thing. It’s when they take those results and intentionally skew the methods or data from these benchmarks for sales or marketing purposes that is the problem we’re discussing here. Vendors that take part in the practice, not only use these benchmarks to show their systems succeeding a little but rather perversely taint their methodology with settings, caching, and other performance enhancements, while leaving their competition’s settings untouched. </p><p>This should be obvious that this is NOT what benchmarking is about! If you read about the history of the <a href="http://www.tpc.org/information/about/history5.asp">Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)</a> you come to understand that this is the very wrongdoing that the council was created to address. But like with any proxy involving measurements, the measurements are inherently pliable.</p><blockquote>By the spring of 1991, the TPC was clearly a success. Dozens of companies were running multiple TPC-A and TPC-B results. Not surprisingly, these companies wanted to capitalize on the TPC's cachet and leverage the investment they had made in TPC benchmarking. Several companies launched aggressive advertising and public relations campaigns based around their TPC results. In many ways, this was exactly why the TPC was created: to provide objective measures of performance. What was wrong, therefore, with companies wanting to brag about their good results? What was wrong is that there was often a large gap between the objective benchmark results and their benchmark marketing claims--this gap, over the years, has been dubbed "benchmarketing." So the TPC was faced with an ironic situation. It had poured an enormous amount of time and energy into creating a good benchmark and even a good benchmark review process. However, the TPC had no means to control how those results were used once they were approved. The resulting problems generated intense debates within the TPC.</blockquote><p>This benchmarketing ultimately fails the clients that these companies are marketing to. It demonstrates not only a lack of care for addressing the users' actual pain but a lack of respect by intentionally pulling the wool over their eyes simply in an attempt to mask that their performance isn't up to par with their competitors. <strong>This leads to consumers not being able to make informed decisions as most of our decisions are made from gut instincts and human emotion which these benchmarks aim to manipulate.</strong></p><p>If you’re not sure exactly how a company would pull this off, an example of might be that database A enables using a cost-based optimizer that requires precomputing statistics about different tables involved in the computation, while database B is running a query against this table without any type of stats based optimization made available to it. Database A will clearly dominate as now it can reorder joins and apply better execution plans while database B is going to go with the simplest plan and run much slower in most scenarios. The company whose product depends on database A will then hone in on the numerical outcomes of this report. Even if they're decent enough to report the methods they skewed to get these results, they bury it within their report and focus on advertising the outcome of what would otherwise be considered an absurd comparison. Companies will even go as far as to say that their competition's database wasn't straight forward to configure when they were setting up optimizations. If you're not capable of understanding how to make equivalent changes to both systems, well then I guess you don't get to run that comparison until you figure it out. &nbsp;</p><p>Many think that consumers are not susceptible to such attacks and would be able to see right through this scheme, but these reports appeal to any of us when we don't have the necessity or resources to thoroughly examine all the data. Many times we have to take cues from our gut when a decision needs to be made and the time to make it is constrained by our time and other business needs. We see this type of phenomenon described in the book, <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. To briefly summarize the model they use, there are two modes that humans use when they reason about their decisions, System 1 and System 2.</p><blockquote>Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine — usually.</blockquote><p>No surprise, that’s usually the part where we get into trouble. While we like to think that we are generally thinking in the logical System 2 mode, we don't have time or energy to live in this space for long periods throughout the day and we find ourselves very reliant on System 1 for much of our decision making.</p><blockquote>The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.</blockquote><p>This is why benchmarketing can be so dangerous because it is so effective at manipulating our belief in claims that simply aren't true. These decisions affect how your architecture will unfold, your time-to-value, and lost hours for your team and customers. It makes having these systems that fairly compare the performance and merits of two systems all-the-more paramount.</p><figure><img src="http://bitsondata.dev/content/images/2020/09/significant.png" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">https://xkcd.com/882/</a></figcaption></figure><p>So why am I talking about this now?</p><p>I have become a pretty big fanboy of a <a href="https://prestosql.io/">Presto</a>, a distributed query engine that runs interactive queries from many sources. I have witnessed firsthand how fast a cluster of Presto nodes are able to process through a huge amount of data at blindingly fast speeds. When you dive into how these speeds are achieved you find that this project is an incredible modern feat of solid engineering that makes interactive analysis over petabytes of data a reality. Going into all the reasons I like this project would be too tangential but it fuels the fire for why I believe this message needs to be heard.</p><p>Recently there was a "benchmark" that came out comparing the performance of a commercial competitor and Presto open-source and enterprise versions, touting performance improvements over Presto by an amount that would have been called out as too high in a CSI episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU">&lt;insert canonical csi clip here&gt;</a>. If you need to find out what I’m talking about, simply google "presto benchmark 3000" and you will find the benchmark along with plenty of other hype they've generated around these "findings". <a href="https://blog.yugabyte.com/yugabytedb-vs-cockroachdb-bringing-truth-to-performance-benchmark-claims-part-1/">Presto isn't the only system in the data space to come under similar types of attacks.</a> It makes sense too, as this type of technical peacocking is common as it successfully gains attention. </p><p>Luckily, as more companies strive to become transparent and associate themselves with open-source efforts, we are starting to see a relatively new pattern of open-source efforts emerge. Typically, you're used to hearing about open-source within the context of software projects maintained by open-source communities. We are now arriving at the age of any noun being able to be used in an open-source framework. There is open-source music, open-source education, and even open-source data. So why not reach a point where open-source benchmarking through consumer collaboration is a thing. This is not just for the sake of the consumers of these technologies who simply want to have more data to inform their design choices to better serve their clients, it's also unfortunate that this affects developer communities that are putting in a lot of hard work on these projects, only to have that hard work get berated unintelligibly by the likes of some corporate status competition.</p><p>Now I'm clearly a little biased when I tell you that I think Presto is currently the best analytics engine on the market today. When I say this, you really should be skeptical too. Really, I encourage it. You should verify in some way beyond a shadow of a doubt that:</p><p> &nbsp;1. Any TPC or other benchmarks are validated and no "magic" was used to improve their performance.</p><figure></figure><p> &nbsp;2. using your own use cases to make sure the system you choose is going to meet the needs of your particular use case.<br></p><p>While this may seem like a lot of work, with cloud infrastructure and simplicity of deploying different …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><strong><strong>Sketching algorithms</strong></strong> compress data in a way that is still useful for answering some pre-specified family of queries, possibly across datasets by comparing sketches. This course will cover mathematically rigorous models for developing such algorithms, as well as some provable limitations of algorithms operating in those models. Some topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Streaming algorithms.</strong> Compute useful statistics over a dataset making only one pass over it, while using little memory.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dimensionality reduction.</strong> General techniques and impossibility results for reducing data dimension while still preserving geometric structure.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Randomized linear algebra.</strong> Algorithms for big matrices (e.g. a user/product rating matrix for Netflix or Amazon). Regression, low rank approximation, clustering, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Compressed sensing.</strong> Recovery of (approximately) sparse signals based on few linear measurements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a graduate course, though there may be room for a limited number of advanced undergraduate students satisfying the following prerequisites: mathematical maturity and comfort with algorithms (e.g. CS 170), discrete probability, and linear algebra.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5e842a035e87b661d8bf062f"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c44372ffee113b1df651"><div><p>“Did you see that Stripe’s CMO is out?” a founder asked one day from the desk behind me.</p><p>Though I’d heard the news, the question had me curious for two reasons: First, I was two months into my own role as head of marketing of a fast-growing fintech startup and curious what my boss thought about the topic. Second, I had closely followed the woman in question and considered her a terrific marketer.</p><p>“It’s only been a year,” he continued. “She must’ve been bad.”<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Revolving door</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This exchange sticks with me years later because it’s emblematic of the mentality some technical founders hold about the role of marketing.</p><p>The thinking goes: Founders build great products that sell themselves through the power of network effects. When the need arises down the road, the company will hire a proven marketing professional to start a department from scratch while everyone’s at a full sprint. If it doesn’t work out…<em>she must’ve been bad</em>.</p><p>In fact, brief tenures and abrupt departures of CMOs have become the norm in Silicon Valley.<strong> </strong>By my count, the tenures of Robinhood’s first <em>three</em> CMOs combined add up to two years; Wealthfront’s first CMO lasted a year and half; and Intercom’s and Affirm’s first CMOs were both out in less than a year. At Dropbox, our first CMO (who I found to be a fantastic leader and marketer) stayed on for just over a year…</p><p>These marketers weren’t all “bad.” Most of them have stellar reputations, in fact. So what’s really going on?</p><p><strong>Founder mentality</strong></p><p>In Silicon Valley, marketing isn’t important—until it is.</p><p>Founders often disregard marketing for as long as possible, convincing themselves it’s “fluff.” A product manager can probably handle things like customer research, product positioning, and the external components of a product launch, and then hand them off to sales, right? After all, he has an MBA. :)</p><p>This works well enough in the early stages, but then problems emerge: Customer-facing team members struggle to stick to a consistent message in the market; information isn’t flowing between customers and product teams; taking turns managing the company Twitter account isn’t working; and the founders have to manage the press alias.</p><p>At the same time, the internal demand for marketing grows: Engineering needs better market insights; product needs successful launches; sales needs more compelling materials; executives need external comms support; HR needs help with recruiting and retention; and customer success needs to scale and automate a lot of customer comms.</p><p>Finally, something happens. The company gets ensnared in a PR crisis, needs to expand to new markets, or faces new competition. If only the company had better brand equity, visibility, or public sentiment, executives could stay focused on what’s important.</p><p>At this point, founders “give in” and kick off the search for a head of marketing to build the function.</p><p><strong>‘Without a penny spent on marketing’</strong></p><p>When recruiting for their first head of marketing, founders will sometimes declare enthusiastically, “Look how far we’ve gotten—and without a penny spent on marketing!”&nbsp;</p><p>I tell them this is analogous to walking into a dentist’s office and proclaiming, “Look how great my teeth look—and without a day of brushing! Do you want to be my first dentist?” Yuck.</p><p>If you didn’t believe in marketing for years, you probably aren’t set up for the function to succeed in the first place. Experienced marketers know this.&nbsp;</p><p>If they’ve done the job before, a candidate will know they’ll be juggling four jobs at the same time:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Job 1: Recruit and manage a team;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Job 2: Define what marketing means at the company and educate the rest of the team;</p></li><li><p>Job 3: Help other departments succeed and scale; and</p></li><li><p>Job 4: Define the brand and tell stories to move the brand forward.</p></li></ul><p>They also know they’ll be stepping into a mess and answering to executives who expect quick results. What’s more, with no team in place, they’ll be responsible for day-to-day activities they’ve been delegating for years (writing copy, setting up marketing dashboards, etc.)&nbsp;</p><p>Do they really want to start at the beginning, with no resources?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First hire a ‘super IC’ (or two)</strong></p><p>Instead of following this failed playbook, I advise startups to think about marketing much earlier in the process and begin laying the foundation that a future leader can build on.</p><p>Set up a small team of one or two strong individual contributors to take on marketing duties. These should be generalists capable of handling a variety of marketing tasks (maybe consider making them <a href="https://helenmin.com/blog/product-marketing">product marketing managers</a>). Have them set up basic infrastructure like a marketing automation tool that connects to your CRM and Google Analytics for your website and blog. Connect them to other departments to begin building websites optimized for conversions, developing simple campaigns, drafting brand messaging, and so on.</p><p>This is a win for the founder, who learns the different marketing functions much earlier in the process. It’s a win for the business generalist, who can find their passion while making an impact at the company. It’s a win for the future head of marketing, because someone will have already done some trial-and-error and gotten the marketing function off the ground. And it’s a win for the recruiter, because the job’s more attractive with someone already on the team cranking.</p><p>These super ICs won’t do all the jobs of a marketing head. They won’t recruit or necessarily even lead. But you’ll have people who understand marketing, speak the language, and can run experiments.</p><p><strong>Self-fulfilling prophecy</strong></p><p>Like NFL coaches, heads of marketing experience a lot of turnover. Because marketing initiatives are often hard to measure and roles aren’t customer-facing, removing a marketing lead is a quick and easy lever for a founder to pull at the first signs of things not working out.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy develops, where marketers <em>assume</em> they’ll only last a year and start making decisions based on that belief. Knowing time is limited, they get over-ambitious and move too fast or focus on things that will pad their resume rather than strategic priorities. After a year or two, they’re off to another company and the startup is back at square one. </p><p>This is bad for startups!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of cybersecurity advice that comes up time and time again is to use a VPN. VPNs, or virtual private networks, encrypt the internet traffic between you and your VPN provider, securing data from your internet provider and local network as well as hiding your IP address. Through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uE7kFcJ_Pk">clever marketing</a>, VPN providers position themselves as an all in one tool to secure yourself online. However, the reality is a lot more complicated.</p><h2>VPNs can sell your data</h2><p>Privacy wise, all a VPN does is shift who you trust with your data. Normally, you would trust your internet provider, like Comcast or AT&amp;T, to not intercept or change any of your data packets. When you use a VPN, that traffic is encrypted through your local internet provider and released at the VPNs servers. This means that your VPN provider could intercept or track your connections. Most VPNs will claim that they do not do this, citing that they have no logging policies. However, VPNs <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/">have lied about this policy</a> before.</p><p>Free VPNs are especially prone to these shady business practices, as they have to pay for their servers somehow. For example, popular free VPN Hotspot Shield was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/ftc-must-scrutinize-hotspot-shield-over-alleged-traffic-interception-group-says/">caught injecting affiliate links into their users traffic</a>. Generally, it's a good idea to avoid most free VPNs and do your research before using any VPN, even if it's paid.</p><h2>VPNs don’t make you anonymous</h2><p>While VPNs do change your public IP address, this isn’t as helpful as you might think. Most IP addresses are shared between multiple people or devices anyway, so services don’t rely on it much for tracking. However, there are lots of other factors that companies use to track you. This includes the cookies in your browser and what accounts you are logged in to, but also many other factors outside of your control such as your user agent or browser fingerprint. Browser fingerprinting, for example, uses factors such as your device, screen size, plugins, and other information about your computer to uniquely identify you. To see this in action, you can visit a site like <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a> to see how unique your browser is to trackers.</p><h2>VPNs don’t make you (that much) more secure</h2><p>VPNs do secure your traffic from your local network, but we already have technologies that do that for us. HTTPS, the padlock in your browser, means that content is encrypted between your computer and the website you are connected to. This makes it really hard for someone to intercept or view the site you are looking at. The most an onlooker would be able to see is the domain name you are connected to, but they wouldn't be able to see the exact page or content you are looking at. Generally, for most people, this should be enough and VPNs wouldn't add many security benefits - especially if the VPN is sketchy itself.</p><h2>So why would I use a VPN?</h2><p>While VPNs aren't needed for most people, there are definitely scenarios in which they are useful. If you are trying to access content that is region restricted, VPNs are useful tools to bypass geoblocks. VPNs are also useful for bypassing restrictive firewalls, or add extra security if you are connected to a public Wi-Fi network. However, before you use a VPN, make sure you do your research about which VPNs are trustworthy and won't sell your data.</p><h2>So how do I secure myself online?</h2><p>The most important way to secure yourself online is simply to follow basic cyber hygiene habits. Use unique passwords for each site with a password manager, don’t click on links in suspicious emails or websites, always keep your software up to date. As internet security and privacy becomes more popular, major VPN companies are going to grow and get more popular. However if you follow basic cyber hygiene habits, your cybersecurity posture will be stronger than if you just used VPN companies.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Everything has a name: a child, a pet, cars, and places. It’s how we befriend subjects and objects and it’s how we recall identifiers. But, naming a brand can be a painful process. It can take a long time and sometimes, it seems to never really come together. In order to take the pressure off of finding the perfect name it’s helpful to remember that businesses create brands, not vice versa. Think <em>Mountain Dew</em> (sounds cumbersome), <em>Starbucks</em> (sounds unrelated) and <em>Virgin</em> (sounds like a lack of experience), <em>The Boring Company</em> (sounds negative), <em>Slack</em> (sounds like the opposite of what it does). Attributed meaning and feelings build in the years after naming.</strong></p>



<hr>







<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="brand-names-in-context">Brand Names in Context</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>First and foremost, a name doesn’t come alone. There will be contextual elements like a tagline, a logo, a color palette that are used on a variety of components, like the top visual on a website, or a headline on an ad. All of those can be filled with words and visuals that reflect a company’s strategy. A name, however, is a central and the longest-standing of all brand components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get help from a naming professional or find a name yourself. The following cornerstones make for a process and provide for a good checklist.</p>
</div>



<div>
<p>The most important aspects of your strategy, <em>your product</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-1-company/">what it is</a>), <em>what does it stand for</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-4-positioning/">positioning</a>), <em>who’s it for</em> (<a href="https://mmarchny.com/creative-strategy-branding-part-2-target-market/">target market</a>), need to get across clearly in the most important brand modules: the name, the logo and a tagline.</p>



<p>The more unknown the company or product, the more direct those aspects need to be laid out in branding communications.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>



<p>Name: Twitter (product: chatter)</p>



<p>Tagline: It’s what’s happening. (positioning: real and now)</p>



<p>Meta description: From breaking news and entertainment to sports and politics, get the full story with all the live commentary. (target market: for news and entertainment readers that look for a variety of opinions)</p>
</div>



<div>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>



<p>Name: Starbucks, originally known as Starbucks Coffee Company (product: coffee)</p>



<p>Tagline: More than just great coffee. (positioning: quality coffee, snacks and atmosphere)</p>



<p>Visuals and additional copy: Employee photos are in the foreground. Alongside copy that describes values: “not only celebrated coffee but also connection. We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of your daily routine. Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew. We call our employees partners because we are all partners in shared success. We make sure everything we do is through the lens of humanity—from our commitment to the highest-quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.” (target market: for people that seek community)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="domain-availability">Domain Availability&nbsp;</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>At the beginning of the naming process, looking up domains that are available can be helpful. It’ll help find competitors as well. If the domain name is not available, an additional industry identifier can be pre or appended, like –books for a bookstore or –foods or eat– for any food-related brands. Think <em>zolabooks.com</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Broad terms like <em>Solutions</em> should be avoided due to lack of meaning (words that can be used by everybody don’t add meaning). Dot-com for companies or dot-org domains for nonprofits remain strongest and are preferred in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="acronyms-founder-names">Acronyms and Founders’ Names</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Usually, good names are shorter, otherwise they’ll get abbreviated naturally later into an acronym. Think <em>KFC, A.T. &amp; T. and P&amp;G</em>. A name sometimes consists of two or three compound words—the words themselves and their first letters need to make a good combination. <em>SS</em> will always have a bad connotation in some countries. No matter how hard one tries to prohibit the usage of monograms, eventually, these letter combos will make their way into file names, into favicons or other collapsed logo versions, into code, especially used when the product is a technical product where truncated versions occur naturally.</p>



<p><strong>B2C brands focus on names that show personality, culture and positioning.</strong> Common names are <em>Apple</em> (easy and obtainable), <em>Nike and Audi</em>. Brand names do not have to be connected to the actual product, although they certainly can be (think <em>Netflix and Aesop</em>), but an appendix can be added that has the potential to be dropped when a brand is well-known. Think <em>Starbucks Coffee Company vs. Starbucks</em>. Short/ fun/ cool/ approachable/ memorable/ indicative trumps logical and longer. Think <em>Hulu, Kodak, Etsy, Mars, 3M, Nest and Sony.</em></p>
</div>



<div>
<p>Avoid a descriptive category or common industry-specific keyword name for a company name. Competitors will pick similar ones which will not only make your brand blend in but the chance to position the company is wasted. Read the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/famous-names">NYT story</a> on EasyMail, MegaMail, and ProMail. Also, descriptive names are harder to trademark and can be impossible to find through Google search.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Founders’ names</strong> are considered functional names. Think <em>Dell, Ford and Colgate.</em> Carrying personality and positioning from the start is not a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>B2B brands</strong> often have a more descriptive name; they will get abbreviated and that’s okay. Think <em>UPS, IBM, AWS.</em> The one thing that’s important for B to B names is that they need to have the potential to sound big, or at least not small and definitely not limiting in what services the company sells. <a href="http://blue/">Bluecore</a>’s first name was TriggerMail. Triggering an email was how the company started out but other products were added on later.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="length-industry-fit-pronunciation"><strong><strong>Length, Industry Fit, Pronunciation</strong></strong></h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Longer names, a group of names and compounds naturally have a tendency to sound smaller unless they include (read: <em>own</em>) an important branch or location of the industry. Think <em>Whole Foods, Natural History Museum, American Airlines</em>.</p>



<p>A name should fit broadly into the field of its peers (read: <em>stand out the right way</em>). It should be easy to remember, have no complicated spelling (or a well-considered or user-tested alternative spelling), be pronounceable in one way only* and it should be ownable within its industry. A domain check and a search through the <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/">trademark database</a> will be of help, but consulting a trademark lawyer who reviews usage in specific categories, states, national and international use, is money well-invested.</p>
</div>



<p><em>* The former car brand Daewoo turned their unpronounceable name into an ad campaign in 1995. Fage yoghurt still needs to have its pronunciation printed on its packaging. Other names that were created before being tested internationally are Huawei, Renault, Tag Heuer and Moschino. Two Princeton University psychologists have found in a </em><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2006/05/29/study-stock-performance-tied-ease-pronouncing-companys-name"><em>2006 study</em></a><em> that “people are more likely to purchase newly offered stocks that have easily pronounced names.”</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="naming-trends">Trends</h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>Different times, different constraints, different trends. For internet companies, the <em>-ster</em> <em>(Napster, Friendster)</em> started in 2001, <em>“My”</em> happened in 2005 (Myspace), and <em>-fy/ -ly/ -y</em> spiked in 2010 <em>(Bitly, Artsy and Weebly). </em>Vowel-dropping for easier trademarking and domain availability was early to mid 2000’s <em>(Flickr, Tumblr, Unbxd, Scribd).</em> The random couple sandwich names mostly found in the fashion industry spiked in 2010. Think <em>Rag &amp; Bone, Kit and Ace, Boll &amp; Branch.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Generally, the naming of products (as opposed to the naming of companies) can be more trendy versus classy because they evolve with the market or they have room for a revamp over time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="spelling-spaces-hyphens"><strong>Spelling, Spaces, Hyphens</strong></h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>As for many things, <em>classy</em> wins in the long run because it never goes out of style.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Spelling of a brand name within text:</em> </p>



<p>An abbreviated company name should be spelled in all caps, not lowercase. A regular name should be spelled together, first letter capitalized. A name should be separated by space or by hyphen if it consists of multiple words, capitalizing each first letter. When compound words are spelled together, there must be only one way to pronounce the compound, if not, it needs separation. A good test for spelling is to insert the name into long- and short-form copy: in the middle of a sentence, at the beginning of a sentence, into a bulleted list and into a signature. The name needs to have a consistent appearance across all applications and not look awkward (think an all lowercase brand name at the beginning of a sentence).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>



<div>
<p><em>Spelling within a logo mark:</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Option 1 “Friendly”:</strong> lowercase spelling in logos (think amazon, adidas, citibank and intel, mailchimp, west elm, ebay) makes companies more approachable, casual, younger or shows a focus on tech. However, within text (general copy or headlines), brand names should still start with a capital letter (Sell on Amazon; In 2016, Mailchimp announced …).&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Option 2 “Timeless”:</strong> Leading capital letters, separated by space or hyphen if more than one word is a brand that has grown up and owns its identity: Squarespace, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, The Container Store, Walmart.</p>



<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> All caps is another timeless use and often a design decision to give the type a more unified or stronger look. Think IKEA (also spelled in call caps within text), MUJI (spelled Muji within text), ZARA (in text: Zara), COSTCO (in text: Costco), THE HOME DEPOT (in text: The Home Depot), NETFLIX (in text: Netflix).</p>



<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> Leading capital letters but no spaces between compounds shows unity and strength by keeping an emphasis on the roots of both. Can be typographically less attractive and are harder to remember how to spell correctly: FedEx, McDonalds, RedBull, HomeGoods, YouTube.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>
<h2 id="listings-soundcheck"><strong>Listings and Soundcheck</strong></h2>
</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>Not the most important thing but the starting letter is another aspect to consider. Your brand will be listed somewhere alphabetically: as a tech product within a marketplace, in a logo series of partnerships, in a print catalog—the higher the …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Mars in 8K</h2>
<p>Along side the Japan Broadcasting Company (NHK), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Company (JAXA) has introduced that it’s planning to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-09-martian-moons-exploration-spacecraft-ultra-high.html">photograph Mars’ mysterious moons</a> with cameras that may shoot 8K ultra-high-definition photos.</p>
<p>If profitable, it might be the primary time in historical past Mars and its moons are captured in such element.</p>
<p>To drag it off, the 2 organizations are teaming as much as develop the “Tremendous Hello-Imaginative and prescient Digicam,” designed to be hooked up to JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) spacecraft, which is ready to launch in 2024.</p>

<p>The MMX mission, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/japan-sample-return-mission-mars-moon">greenlit</a> by the Japanese authorities again in February, will try to uncover the mysteries surrounding the origin tales of Mars’s two comparatively tiny moons, Deimos and Phobos. They’re extremely uncommon as they orbit the Purple Planet at extraordinarily shut distances. Deimos’ orbit takes it as shut as <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/in-depth/">3,700 miles</a> away from the Martian floor — about one p.c of the gap between the Earth and its Moon.</p>
<p>Other than the digital camera, the spacecraft will carry 11 scientific devices to the Martian system. It is going to even try to gather a floor pattern from Phobos’&nbsp;floor earlier than taking the lengthy journey house.</p>
<p>The digital camera will snap ultra-HD photos<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and broadcast them for the world to see, courtesy of JAXA. The untouched recordsdata might be domestically saved on a recording system hooked up to the MMX spacecraft and can hopefully make all of it the way in which again to Earth — if every little thing goes in keeping with plan.</p>

This was due to my participation in <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replication Markets</a>, a part of DARPA's SCORE program, whose goal is to evaluate the reliability of social science research. 3000 studies were split up into 10 rounds of ~300 studies each. Starting in August 2019, each round consisted of one week of surveys followed by two weeks of market trading. I finished in first place in 3 out 10 survey rounds and 6 out of 10 market rounds. In total, about $200,000 in prize money will be awarded.</p><p>The studies were sourced from all social sciences disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>The average replication probability in the market was 54%; while the replication results are not out yet (250 of the 3000 papers will be replicated), previous experiments have shown that prediction markets work well.<span><a href="#fn19282306691" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306691">1</sup></a></span></p><p>This is what the distribution of my own predictions looks like:<span><a href="#fn19282306692" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306692">2</sup></a></span></p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_mypredsdist-67f351a8a634ca87ace22fd62155e7c5.png"></p><p>My average forecast was in line with the market. A quarter of the claims were above 76%. And a quarter of them were below 33%: we're talking hundreds upon hundreds of terrible papers, and this is just a tiny sample of the annual academic production.</p><p>Criticizing bad science from an abstract, 10000-foot view is pleasant: you hear about some stuff that doesn't replicate, some methodologies that seem a bit silly. "They should improve their methods", "p-hacking is bad", "we must change the incentives", you declare Zeuslike from your throne in the clouds, and then go on with your day.</p><p>But actually diving into the sea of trash that is social science gives you a more tangible perspective, a more visceral revulsion, and perhaps even a sense of Lovecraftian awe at the sheer magnitude of it all: a vast landfill—a great agglomeration of garbage extending as far as the eye can see, effluvious waves crashing and throwing up a foul foam of p=0.049 papers. As you walk up to the diving platform, the deformed attendant hands you a pair of flippers. Noticing your reticence, he gives a subtle nod as if to say: "come on then, jump in".</p><h2 id="They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing"><a href="#They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing" title="They Know What They're Doing"></a>They Know What They're Doing</h2><p>Prediction markets work well because predicting replication is easy.<span><a href="#fn19282306693" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306693">3</sup></a></span> There's no need for a deep dive into the statistical methodology or a rigorous examination of the data, no need to scrutinize esoteric theories for subtle errors—these papers have obvious, surface-level problems.</p><p>There's a popular belief that weak studies are the result of unconscious biases leading researchers down a "garden of forking paths". Given enough "researcher degrees of freedom" even the most punctilious investigator can be misled.</p><p>I find this belief impossible to accept. The brain is a credulous piece of meat<span><a href="#fn19282306694" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306694">4</sup></a></span> but there are limits to self-delusion. Most of them have to know. It's understandable to be led down the garden of forking paths while producing the research, but when the paper is done and you give it a final read-over you will surely notice that all you have is a n=23, p=0.049 three-way interaction effect (one of dozens you tested, and with no multiple testing adjustments of course). At that point it takes more than a <em>subtle unconscious bias</em> to believe you have found something real. And even if the authors really are misled by the forking paths, what are the editors and reviewers doing? Are we supposed to believe they are all gullible rubes?</p><p>People within the academy don't want to rock the boat. They still have to attend the conferences, secure the grants, publish in the journals, show up at the faculty meetings: all these things depend on their peers. When criticising bad research it's easier for everyone to blame the forking paths rather than the person walking them. No need for uncomfortable unpleasantries. The fraudster can admit, without much of a hit to their reputation, that indeed they were <em>misled</em> by that <em>dastardly garden</em>, really through no fault of their own whatsoever, at which point their colleagues on twitter will applaud and say "ah, good on you, you handled this tough situation with such exquisite virtue, this is how progress happens! hip, hip, hurrah!" What a ridiculous charade.</p><p>Even when they do accuse someone of wrongdoing they use terms like "Questionable Research Practices" (QRP). How about Questionable Euphemism Practices?</p><ul><li>When they measure a dozen things and only pick their outcome variable at the end, that's not the garden of forking paths but the greenhouse of fraud.</li><li>When they do a correlational analysis but give "policy implications" as if they were doing a causal one, they're not walking around the garden, they're doing the landscaping of forking paths.</li><li>When they take a continuous variable and arbitrarily bin it to do subgroup analysis or when they add an <em>ad hoc</em> quadratic term to their regression, they're...fertilizing the garden of forking paths? (Look, there's only so many horticultural metaphors, ok?)</li></ul><p>The bottom line is this: if a random schmuck with zero domain expertise like me can predict what will replicate, <em>then so can scientists who have spent half their lives studying this stuff</em>. But they sure don't act like it.</p><h2 id="or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t"><a href="#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t" title="...or Maybe They Don't?"></a>...or Maybe They Don't?</h2><blockquote><p>The horror! The horror!</p></blockquote><p>Check out this crazy chart from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/28/1909046117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yang et al. (2020)</a>:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_citations-7d4f72c6e9582a5ba8775da70eda80e1.png"></p><p>Yes, you're reading that right: studies that replicate are cited at the same rate as studies that do not. Publishing your own weak papers is one thing, but citing other people's weak papers? This seemed implausible, so I decided to do my own analysis with a sample of 250 articles from the Replication Markets project. The correlation between citations per year and (market-estimated) probability of replication was -0.05!</p><p>You might hypothesize that the citations of non-replicating papers are negative, but negative citations are extremely rare.<span><a href="#fn19282306695" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306695">5</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> puts the rate at 2.4%. Astonishingly, even <em>after retraction</em> the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18974415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of citations are positive</a>, and those positive citations <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue for decades after retraction</a>.<span><a href="#fn19282306696" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306696">6</sup></a></span></p><p>As in all affairs of man, it once again comes down to Hanlon's Razor. Either:</p><ol><li>Malice: they know which results are likely false but cite them anyway.</li><li>or, Stupidity: they can't tell which papers will replicate even though it's quite easy.</li></ol><p>Accepting the first option would require a level of cynicism that even I struggle to muster. But the alternative doesn't seem much better: <em>how can they not know?</em> I, an idiot with no relevant credentials or knowledge, can fairly accurately determine good research from bad, but all the tenured experts can not? How can they not tell <em>which papers are retracted</em>?</p><p>I think the most plausible explanation is that scientists don't read the papers they cite, which I suppose involves both malice <em>and</em> stupidity.<span><a href="#fn19282306697" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306697">7</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scanners#citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwern has an write-up on this question</a> citing some ingenious analyses based on the proliferation of misprints: "Simkin &amp; Roychowdhury venture a guess that as many as 80% of authors citing a paper have not actually read the original". Once a paper is out there nobody bothers to check it, even though they know there's a 50-50 chance it's false!</p><p>Whatever the explanation might be, the fact is that the academic system does not allocate citations to true claims.<span><a href="#fn19282306698" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306698">8</sup></a></span> This is bad not only for the direct effect of basing further research on false results, but also because it distorts the incentives scientists face. If nobody cited weak studies, we wouldn't have so many of them. Rewarding impact without regard for the truth inevitably leads to disaster.</p><h2 id="There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards"><a href="#There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards" title="There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards"></a>There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards</h2><p>Naïvely you might expect that the top-ranking journals would be full of studies that are highly likely to replicate, and the low-ranking journals would be full of p&lt;0.1 studies based on five undergraduates. Not so! Like citations, journal status and quality are not very well correlated: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no association between statistical power and impact factor</a>, and journals with higher impact factor <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/071530v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have more papers with erroneous p-values</a>.</p><p>This pattern is repeated in the Replication Markets data. As you can see in the chart below, there's no relationship between h-index (a measure of impact) and average expected replication rates. There's also no relationship between h-index and expected replication <em>within</em> fields.</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journalhindex-34ca20d3877248fe6b7313c3e2d39fae.png"></p><p>Even the <em>crème de la crème</em> of economics journals barely manage a ⅔ expected replication rate. 1 in 5 articles in QJE scores below 50%, and this is a journal that accepts just 1 out of every 30 submissions. Perhaps this (partially) explains why scientists are undiscerning: journal reputation acts as a cloak for bad research. It would be fun to test this idea empirically.</p><p>Here you can see the distribution of replication estimates for every journal in the RM sample:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journals-cdc1139ad4faf1819b8b42db914dbe81.png"></p><p>As far as I can tell, for most journals the question of whether the results in a paper are true is a matter of secondary importance. If we model journals as wanting to maximize "impact", then this is hardly surprising: as we saw above, citation counts are unrelated to truth. If scientists were more careful about what they cited, then journals would in turn be more careful about what they publish.</p><h2 id="Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better"><a href="#Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better" title="Things Are Not Getting Better"></a>Things Are Not Getting Better</h2><p>Before we got to see any of the actual Replication Markets studies, we voted on the expected replication rates by year. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gordon et al. (2020)</a> has that data: replication rates were expected to steadily increase from 43% in 2009/2010 to 55% in 2017/2018.</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_years_pre-7012095f551422f22db31bfffda1c899.png"></p><p>This is what the average predictions looked like <em>after</em> seeing the papers: from 53.4% in 2009 to 55.8% in 2018 (difference not statistically significant; black dots are means).</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_years-1c0573dfb59a70e36a43deb2692229bf.png"></p><p>I frequently encounter the notion that after the replication crisis hit there was some sort of great improvement in the social sciences, that people wouldn't even dream of publishing studies based on 23 undergraduates any more (I actually saw plenty of those), etc. Stuart Ritchie's new book praises …</p></div></div>

                <center><em><p>The most ambitious crossover event in automatic differentiation history</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Friday, September 11, 2020 · 4 min read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p> Summary of this post: It turns out that by carefully mixing forward-mode and
 reverse-mode automatic differentiation, you can greatly simplify certain
 hyperparameter optimization algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fun recursive idea: just like how we optimize the parameters of
machine learning models by gradient descent, we can also their
<em>hyperparameters</em> by gradient descent. This is by no means a new idea; you can
find 20-year-old papers that discuss (for example) optimizing gradient descent
step sizes by gradient descent itself.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two ways to do this. The “short-term” way is to take a
<em>single</em>  step of gradient descent, and then based on how that goes, adjust the
hyperparameters. That’s the premise of the 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782">Online Learning Rate
Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent</a>: it
turns out that you can do this in an extremely lightweight way. You would hope
that over time the hyperparameters converge to something optimal alongside the
parameters (and indeed that is the case, though you have to be careful).</p>
<p>The “long-term” way is to train <em>several</em> steps and <em>then</em> backpropagate
through the <em>entire training</em> to adjust the hyperparameters. The hope is that
this provides a stronger “signal” to the hyperparameter-gradient, which is
better for convergence. But, this comes at the (tremendous) expense of having
to store a copy of the entire computation graph for several steps of training,
and then backpropagate through it. If your model has 1GB of parameters, you
need to store ~1GB worth of numbers for <em>each step</em>. You can imagine that adds
up over the course of many epochs, and so the algorithm is severely limited by
how much RAM you have.</p>
<p>The 2015 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492">Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible
Learning</a> makes this work by throwing away
the intermediate steps of the computation graph and then JIT-re-computing it
“in reverse” during backpropagation. It’s a clever technique, but kind of hairy
and hard to implement (you have to be super careful about numerical precision).</p>
<p>Here’s a graph that visualizes these two techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13371">from this
paper</a>). You’re looking at several parallel
loss curves (($\log(f)$) is the loss plotted on a log scale), pointing towards
you, arranged in order of the “step size” hyperparameter
(that’s ($\log(\alpha)$)). The orange curve represents a “short-term”
hyperparameter optimization, which is allowed to move along the “step size”
axis at each step. The “long-term” hyperparameter optimization instead
optimizes directly on the thick black dashed “U” — that is, after <em>several</em>
steps of training. You can see how the latter is smoother, but also much harder
to compute.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/fig-metasurface.png" alt="The preceding paragraph explains this
figure."></p>
<p>To summarize: the short-term way is cheap but noisy. The long-term way is
expensive but less noisy. Can we get the best of both worlds?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, let’s think more carefully about the source of the expense. The problem
is that we need to store (or be able to reconstruct) the full computation graph
in order to do backpropagation. Okay, but do we really <em>need</em> to do
backpropagation? The only reason we backpropagate is that it’s more efficient
in the case when you want derivatives with respect to <em>many</em> different
variables. If you have millions of model parameters, backpropagation is
millions of times faster than the much simpler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers">forward-mode (“dual numbers”)
automatic
differentiation</a>.</p>
<p>But we <em>don’t</em> have millions of <em>hyperparameters!</em> Step size, for example, is
just a single number. The Adam optimizer only has a total of 4 hyperparameters.
With this in mind, backpropagation isn’t even the right choice — we <em>should</em>
be using dual numbers for the hyperparameter optimization. On the other hand,
we should still be using backpropagation for the “inner loop” that optimizes
the (non-hyper-) parameters. That is, we want to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>initialize hyperparameters
# loop to optimize hyperparameters
while True:
  initialize parameters
  # loop to optimize parameters
  for i in range(100):
    run model on data to get loss
    # using reverse-mode!
    compute d(loss) / d(parameters)
    update parameters using hyperparameters
  # using forward-mode
  compute d(loss) / d(hyperparameters)
  update hyperparameters
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update: I discovered that this was suggested in the 2017 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01785">Forward and
Reverse Gradient-Based Hyperparameter
Optimization</a>. But keep reading — while
the paper’s
<a href="https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO/blob/master/far_ho/hyper_gradients.py#L375">implementation</a>
needs a lot of math to be worked out manually, I’m going to show you how to
implement this in a way that makes all the math in the paper fall out “for
free”…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal raises a logistical question: how do we reconcile these two
automatic differentiation algorithms in the same program? <strong>The “trick” is to
“thread” dual numbers through a backpropagation implementation.</strong> In other
words, implement backpropagation as usual, but rather than <code>float</code> type
numbers, exclusively use <code>dual_number</code> type numbers (even when doing derivative
calculations). Initialize the system such that the dual numbers track
derivatives with respect to the hyperparameters you care about. Then, your
final loss value’s attached ($\epsilon$)-value <em>immediately</em> gives you
<code>d(loss)/d(hyperparameters)</code>. No backpropagation needed — and so, it’s safe
to “forget” the computation graph.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s all I wanted to share in this blog post! :)</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not obvious how to implement this in PyTorch, since you can’t
naïvely do <code>tensor(dtype=dual_number)</code>. Rather than hack in a custom numeric
data type that implemented dual numbers, I wrote my own tiny implementations of
forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. It’s just a couple dozen
(very-recognizable-to-automatic-differentiation-enthusiasts) lines of code. I
was careful to make each implementation generic in the kind of “number” it
accepts. That allowed me to run the reverse-mode algorithms using the
forward-mode data types.</p>
<p>Running it on a simple quadratic optimization problem, we can see that updating
the hyperparameter ($\alpha$) yields better-looking loss curves — in this
GIF, we’re discovering that we should increase the step size. Yay!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/loss.gif" alt="GIF of loss curve becoming better over
time"></p>
<p>I think this is a very neat trick, which surely has other cool applications
(for example, differentiating through long-running physics simulations!). If
you’re curious, check out this <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/hybrid-hyperoptimization.ipynb">IPython
notebook</a> for
the full source code. Feel free to adapt it to your ideas. Then, tell me what
you’ve built!</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Early in my career, after a short initial interview at a consulting firm in Toronto, I was invited to a technical interview on the same day. Two of the senior developers from the team I would join would conduct the interview.</p><p>The interview started pleasantly with them describing the project they have been working on: a portal for university professors to communicate with their students. It was being built with ASP.NET MVC, a framework I had been working with for several years. I expressed that I was comfortable with the framework and I would be excited to work on the project. Then the technical examination began and on its conclusion I left the interview feeling humiliated.</p><p>Many years later, when I was preparing to take an interview, I looked back on this experience to realize that the line of questioning and approach had been an ego trip for those developers. I promised myself to <em>never</em> make any of my candidates feel the way I did.</p><p>What did those developers do wrong? Leaving aside their attitude towards me, their questions had no relevance to the role or the project. I did not know what a red-black tree was at the time but I definitely knew how to use ASP.NET MVC which they did not inquire about.</p><p>My golden rule for technical interviews is that, "Every step, conversation and question <em>must</em> be pertinent to the day-to-day of the role." While this may be obvious, I am sure that many hiring managers are still expecting candidates to arrive at technical interviews with Computer Science books memorized. This form of technical interviews should be made obsolete.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bigger button = more clicks on the CTA <a href="https://t.co/Ter7xJdNKM">pic.twitter.com/Ter7xJdNKM</a></p>— Vincent Déniel (@vincentdnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentdnl/status/1291041278264713220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>With my golden rule as guide, I conduct a much simpler interview process. Prior to an interview, my team and I review samples of code that the candidate shared with us (or had written on Github) to understand the quality of their code. And during the interview, I dive into three areas of discussions with the candidates: product building, process adherence and team work.</p><h3 id="product-building">Product Building</h3><p>I try to understand the candidate's interest and experience of building products by,</p><ol><li>Going through their past experience and asking about what technologies and products they built and how. I ask about previous products they have shipped from concept to market.</li><li>To understand their thought process for deriving solutions, I draw an UI and ask them to outline and explain what approaches, structures and technologies they would use to build it out.</li><li>I ask about how they keep up with technologies and how they improve their skills to gauge their passion for the work.</li></ol><h3 id="process-adherence">Process Adherence</h3><p>To better understand how the candidate does their work,</p><ol><li>I go over their experiences and ask about how they managed their product-building and what tools and processes they used.</li><li>I explain the process of working on our team and ask how they would change it and where they see inefficiencies to discuss their thinking.</li><li>Often, I will give them a scenario where the processes are failing the team to find what they would do to tackle inefficiencies and if they would be willing to speak up.</li></ol><h3 id="team-work">Team Work</h3><p>I also try to understand how a candidate works in a team,</p><ol><li>While going through their past experiences, I ask about how they collaborated and communicated with their teams.</li><li>I present a scenario where their knowledge in an area may be lacking and evaluate if and how they would leverage and collaborate with their team.</li><li>Another scenario I ask about is where they disagree with their team-members to evaluate how they manage conflict and focus on delivering results for the team.</li></ol><p>I do this within one interview to be mindful of the candidate's time and mine. I want to hire candidates for their will to learn, grow and challenge the status quo.</p><p>The technology landscape is such that anyone can acquire a set of baseline programming skills. What is needed then, is a willingness to challenge ourselves and stay open-minded because every developer will have to learn on the job almost all of the time. Given this, the technical interview is arcane, academic and as good as dead.</p><hr><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><ol><li><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/helpful-com/https-medium-com-fnthawar-helpful-technical-interviews-are-garbage-dc5d9aee5acd">Technical interviews are garbage.

<h2 id="when-a-relationship-starts-with-an-act-of-dishonesty-or-manipulation-it-will-be-a-toxic-relationship"><em>When a relationship starts with an act of dishonesty or manipulation, it will be a toxic relationship</em>.</h2>
<p>This is common knowledge.</p>
<p>Most major web hosting companies groom potential customers in manipulative ways, but, sadly, many do not recognize the trouble signs due to naivety or need.</p>
<p>Here is one important, but common cue that your webhost-to-be will not respect you, and you are in for a compromising, dysfunctional relationship.</p>
<h2 id="but-you-said-395-a-month-">But you said 3.95 a month… :(</h2>
<h3 id="the-solicitation">The Solicitation</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it.jpg" alt="Do you really mean it?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/</a></p>
<p>In the ad above, this average young woman has just been approached by what could be the prince-charming of webhosts, bluehost himself. She is excited and flattered that she could have him for the price of $3.50 a month.</p>
<p>Enticed, she takes the bait.</p>
<h3 id="getting-into-the-car">Getting into the Car</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it-2.jpg" alt="Is it too good to be true?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards">https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards</a></p>
<p>Now the young lady is excited, because although it seemed too good to be true, it looks like this might just be true love. $3.95 a month! Things are finally looking up.</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-ride">Taking the Ride</h3>
<p>After some flirty initial conversation of what her domain name will be, our prince charming bluehost finally gets down to his intentions.</p>
<p>He says, <strong>“So let’s talk about that $178.08…"</strong></p>
<p>And her heart sinks…</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/get-your-hands-off-me.jpg" alt="Get your hands off me!"></p>
<p>And now we’ve quickly arrived at that part of the relationship known as <em><strong>“Get your hands off me!"</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="17808-for-3-years-is-not-395-a-month">$178.08 for 3 Years is Not $3.95 a Month</h2>
<p>One might argue that if you divide the numbers over 3 years, it evens out to the price stated: $3.95.</p>
<p>But that’s <em>not</em> $3.95 a month.</p>
<p>That <em>is</em> $178.08 for three years.</p>
<p>If it was $3.95 a month, I could pay $3.95 for the first month, $3.95 for the second… $3.95 for the third … etc.</p>
<p>It was lie, a manipulation, a sign.</p>
<h3 id="my-wedding-ring-costs-less-per-month-every-year">My wedding ring costs less per month every year…</h3>
<p>So by this logic, a $1000 wedding ring costs $1.66 dollars a month after 50 years of marriage. Assuming there is no divorce.</p>
<h3 id="but-if-you-say-yes">But if you say yes…</h3>
<p>Sadly, some people will ignore the first alarm signs of the toxic relationship, and convince themselves that they did not just get manipulated.</p>
<p>Sadly, that “deal” is lost in a short time due to common upsells inherent to hosts such as this.  Because if you don’t say “get your hands off me” you enable future exploits, and the web host knows this. He’s good at what he does.</p>
<h3 id="prince-charming-is-a-dime-a-dozen">Prince Charming is a Dime a Dozen</h3>
<p>Despite how unique and valuable this prince charming purports to be, there is a street full of them coming from every alley way.</p>
<p>Most major cheap hosting companies operate this way.</p>
<p>Don’t give up your standards and settle. The good hosts are hard to find, because they don’t hang out in the main traffic areas of society/internet.</p>

The sound of the NBC chimes is the sound of radio history itself.  Probably no single sound better recalls 
the golden age of radio.  The NBC chimes – the musical notes G-E-C – were played at the end of every 
NBC radio program beginning shortly after the network's inception, and continued in daily use on NBC radio and television 
until 1971. </p><p>
&nbsp;Shortly after the formation of the National Broadcasting Company
in 1926, network executives became aware of confusion among the
affiliate stations as to the exact when a program ended, and when it
was safe to cut away for local announcements. The problem was assigned
to a committee of three: Oscar B. Hanson, NBC's Director of Engineer
and a former AT&amp;T engineer; Earnest la Prada, an NBC orchestra
leader; and Phillips Carlin, an NBC announcer. They decided that a
musical signal of some kind would be an appropriate way to indicate the
ending of all programs. At that time, it was common for radio stations
to use the sounds of chimes, gongs, sirens and other mechanical devices
as a signature sound for their station, so the choice of a chime by NBC
was not unusual or particularly innovative. There is in fact some
evidence that the chimes may have been inspired by a similar chime
sequence used at that time by NBC affiliate WSB in Atlanta. </p><p>

During 1927 and 1928, the committee experimented with several combinations of notes.  A seven-note 
sequence which was first used, G-C-F-E-G-C-E, was determined to be too complicated for the announcers to 
play correctly on a consistent basis.  It was first simplified to G-C-F-E, and finally to just G-E-C.  This familiar 
sequence was heard for the first time on November 29, 1929.</p><p>

The chimes were sounded at :29:30 and :59:30 of each hour, to indicate the start 
of the 30 second local station break. They were initially struck by hand by the 
announcer, using a set of hand-held chimes held up to the microphone.<span face="Times New Roman">
</span>
<span>
But, there were inconsistencies in the chimes' tempo, volume, and exact timing.&nbsp; </span>
<span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I</span>t was finally determined that the 
best way to solve these problems was for the chimes to be generated 
mechanically.</p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Schematic" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimach.gif" height="480" width="430"><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Chimes Machine" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes2b.jpg" height="480" width="640"></p>
<p>&gt;
</p></center>

The man who designed the chimes machine was 
Captain Richard H. Ranger, who was also the inventor of the electronic organ and the RCA facsimile.  
Ranger created a device resembling a music box, where fingers on a revolving drum plucked a set of reeds.  
There were three sets of eight reeds, one for each note, allowing the generation of the fundamental note 
plus several overtones.   Each reed formed one plate of a capacitor in an oscillator circuit, and the signal 
generated by all reeds was amplified by a single 6C6 pentode tube.  It was activated by a timer,
which would cut off the program two seconds before its end (whether it was finished or 
not!) and feed the chimes to the network. <p>

NBC built a limited number of chime machines. NBC in San Francisco  had two of them - the main and backup 
machines.  Others were installed ain other cities around the country where network programs were originated 
– Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and perhaps a few others.  It is likely that not more than a dozen chimes 
machines were ever made. </p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Inside View" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes5b.jpg"><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Chimes Machine Name Tag" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes7b.jpg" height="349" width="512"></p>
</center>

The photos on this page show one of the few chime machines still in existence, now in the hands of a private 
collector.  (NBC had the short-sighted habit of discarding large quantities of historical artifacts throughout 
its history.  It's only through the far-sightedness of a few NBC employees, who saved some of these items 
from the trash bins, that we can today experience many recorded programs, photos, and other memorabilia from 
that era.)
<p>

&nbsp;The unit shown is the chimes machine serial number 2, probably from the first group ever made.   Its mechanical 
parts, although finely crafted, appear to have been hand made.  This unit is no doubt the original chimes machine 
placed in operation at NBC's studios at 111 Sutter Street in San Francisco.  The schematic diagram, 
also shown, indicates that serial number 5 was fabricated in 1933, so this machine would have 
predated it.  The main cabinet contains the motor drive reed mechanism and amplifier, which is accessed by  
removing the front panel's four thumbscrews.  The unit operated from an external power source, no doubt the same 
battery and motor generator system that operated the audio amplifiers in the studios.   The smaller box 
contains the timer and switches that operate the chimes for both studio and "NEMO" broadcast lines.  
("NEMO" was a term used in early radio to indicate a remote broadcast.  It comes from a telephone term, 
and stands for "Not Emanating Main Office".)  The chime machine could be operated in an automatic mode by 
the clock, which was the usual method of operation, or manually by the announcer in the event of programs 
with imprecise ending times, such as sports broadcasts. 
</p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Timer" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes4b.jpg" height="458" width="640"></center>

&nbsp;<p>The NBC chimes were officially registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1950 as a registered service mark, the first 
known case of a sound receiving trademark protection.  They were last heard regularly on NBC 
television in 1976, used to mark the 50th anniversary of the network. </p>

<div>
  
  <p>Here is a remembrance of the NBC 
  Chimes Machine from Rick Greenhut - February 3, 2013:</p>
  
  <p>
  <span>John,</span></p></div>

<p>
<span>Just saw your 
page on the Bay Area Radio Museum dedicated to the NBC chimes machine, and I 
wanted to give you another historical fact to add. In 1969 when I went to work 
as a summer replacement engineer (board op) at NBC-owned WKYC Cleveland, there 
was still a chimes machine back in the racks. Since all the O&amp;O's originated 
programs like NOTH (New On The Hour) and Monitor inserts, they all had 2 chimes 
machines. Besides WNBC/New York, WMAQ/Chicago and KNBR/San Francisco, 
WKYC/Cleveland and WRC/Washington also had chimes machines.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>By the next 
  summer I worked there, the chimes machine was gone - whether thrown away or 
  taken home by one of the old-timers, I couldn't say.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>Last bit of 
  radio trivia: I was doing Affiliate Relations for the NBC Radio Network in 
  August of 1987, and during the NABET engineers strike those of us in 
  management with technical backgrounds were taking shifts running the board for 
  the NOTH and manning the ROD (Radio Operations Desk) in Radio Central (network 
  master control). I was the first management person on the board when the 
  engineers walked out at 6:00 AM that morning, and engineered the 6, 7, 8 and 9 
  AM NOTH (the talent was Gary Nunn, now heard on the CBS Radio Network). At 
  8:30 that morning I was told by the General Manager, Craig Simon, that the 
  network had been sold to Westwood One, and that the chimes were not part of 
  the sale, so I was forbidden to play them at the end of the newscast like we 
  usually did.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I ignored 
  him, and "chimed out" at the end of the 9:00 AM newscast as per usual. He came 
  up to the studio a few minutes later with a funny smile on his face, and told 
  me to make sure no one else did that. I made sure by taking the chimes cart 
  and backup out of the studio. I bulked the backup, and have the last remaining 
  cart with the NBC chimes (recorded directly from the WNBC chimes machine) in 
  my collection.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I was the 
  last person to play the chimes on the NBC Radio Network.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>Thanks to Clint Gibler, Grayson Hardaway, and Pablo Estrada at r2c for their contributions to this piece. And thanks to r2c for contracting me to write it! This article is cross-posted on <a href="https://jacobian.org/2020/sep/11/analyzing-dos-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacobian.org</a>.</em></p>
<p>When I ran the security team at Heroku, I had this recurring nightmare: my PagerDuty alarm goesoff, alerting me to some sort of security incident. In my dream, I’d look at my phone and realize “oh no, this is the big one” — and then I’d wake up.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure exactly what the attack in my dream was, but it may very well have been a <em>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</em> attack. DoS attacks are simple but can be devastating: an attacker crafts and sends traffic to your app in a way that overwhelms your servers. While this is arguably not as bad as a remote code execution or a data breach, it’s still pretty terrible. If your customers can’t use your app, you’ll lose their money and their trust.</p>
<p>Typically, we talk about two kinds of Denial-of-Service attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Normal” Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where a single machine is sufficient to cause downtime. The classic, old-school version of this attack is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>: an attacker tricks your server into expanding a specially-crafted ZIP file that is tiny compressed but expands to entirely fill your disk space.</li>
<li>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks rely on an attacker sending a huge flood of traffic to your site from multiple machines (that’s the “Distributed” part). Often, these attacks come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botnets</a> — fleets of compromised machines controlled by an attacker. These botnets are available to purchase in certain corners of the Internet, making a DDoS attack well within the reach of anyone with a credit card.</li>
</ol>
<p>Engineers who work on web applications frequently run into vulnerabilities that could be used in a DoS/DDoS attack. Unfortunately, there’s broad disagreement in the industry about how to treat these vulnerabilities. The risk can be difficult to analyze: I’ve seen development teams argue for <em>weeks</em> over how to handle a DoS vector.</p>
<p>This article tries to cut through those arguments. It provides a framework for engineering and application security teams to think about denial-of-service risk, breaks down DoS vulnerabilities into high-, medium-, and low-risk classes, and has recommendations for mitigations at each layer.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this post is on the big picture, and should apply to any kind of web app. But to make things concrete, I’ve added a few specific Django-related examples. (I helped create it, so it’s what I’m most familiar with.)</p>
<h2>Evaluating Denial-of-Service Risk</h2>
<p>Evaluating the risk of a DoS vulnerability at the application layer can be difficult. There’s widespread disagreement among security professionals: you’ll often see two different appsec teams treat similar issues very differently.</p>
<p>Some argue: it’s nearly impossible to entirely mitigate against a focused DDoS — a dedicated enough attacker can throw more bandwidth at you than your app can handle. You can never fully mitigate a DDoS attack without serious support from an upstream network provider with specific tools to protect bot attacks (e.g., Cloudflare). Thus, chasing and fixing hypothetical DoS vulnerabilities can seem like a waste of developer time. These teams treat most potential DoS vectors as acceptable risk, and focus their energy at preparing mitigations at the network level.</p>
<p>Other teams point out that the traditional risk model has three potential problem areas: Confidentiality, Integrity, and <em>Availability</em>. We’ve long understood that uptime is a security issue. It’s becoming increasingly common for attackers to take a service down and then demand a ransom to stop the attack. The recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack against Garmin</a> is a highly notable example; attackers took down nearly all of Garmin’s services, and reportedly demanded US $1 million to stop the attack. (In this case the attack was ransomware, but it’s easy to see how a DoS attack could have a similar effect). Thus, DoS vulnerabilities are risks like any other, and it’s easy to understand the argument that they should all be mitigated.</p>
<p>It’s important to recognize that both of these positions are valid! It’s reasonable to see DoS as out-of-scope for application security; it’s similarly reasonable to scope it in. I’ve often seen security teams get completely stuck arguing between these two positions. Since neither is “right” or “wrong”, it can be impossible to figure out how to move forward.</p>
<h3>How I decide: <em>attacker leverage</em></h3>
<p>The model I use to cut through this argument is the concept of <em>attacker leverage</em>. Levers amplify force: a small amount of force applied to the long end of the lever is multiplied at the short end. In the context of a DoS attack, if a vulnerability has <em>high leverage</em> it means attackers can consume a ton of your server resources with minimal resources.</p>
<p>For example, if a bug in your web app allows a single <code>GET</code> request to consume 100% CPU, that’s a terrific amount of leverage. Just a small handful of attacks, and your web servers will grind to a halt. A <em>low leverage</em> vulnerability, on the other hand, requires a high amount of attacker resources to cause minor availability degradation. If an attacker has to spend thousands of dollars to bring a single server to its knees, you can probably scale up faster than they can.</p>
<p>The higher the leverage, the higher the risk, and the more likely I am to address the issue directly. The lower the leverage, the more likely I’ll accept the risk and/or lean on network-level mitigations.</p>
<p>Let’s get specific. I’ve broken down DoS risk into high, medium, and low risk classes, based on leverage. For each class, I’ll look at how to recognize that a vulnerability falls into this class, discuss a few examples, and give some suggestions for mitigation.</p>
<h2>High leverage DoS vulnerabilities: easily-amplified resource starvation</h2>
<p>The classic high-risk DoS vulnerability is one where an attacker can cause resource starvation using very little resources themselves. This could mean exhaustion of any number of types of resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that magnifies uploaded data and fills the disk, as in the case of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Network bandwidth</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that amplifies input traffic, where a single incoming request consumes tons of bandwidth, causing network starvation. I’ve seen this happen with a bug in a microservices system, where a single incoming request triggered millions of internal API requests (including moving some fairly large files around the network), and choked off the internal network bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>CPU utilization</strong> — e.g., an exploit that triggers an <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidentally quadratic</a> algorithm, causing web servers to grind to a halt.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency limits</strong> — most servers have a maximum concurrency limit (e.g., max threads or processes, or max connections for a database); an exploit that causes a process to run very slowly (or never exit) can cause the server to hit those limits and start rejecting requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, the unifying factor is that a bug in the application will allow significant amplification.</p>
<h3>Authentication affects risk</h3>
<p>When considering the risk of a resource amplification DoS vector, an important factor is the level of authentication required to trigger the vulnerability.
If a completely anonymous user can easily trigger a resource starvation attack, it’ll be extremely easy for an attacker to bring you to your knees. Unauthenticated DoS vectors should be considered very high risk.
On the other hand, if only users who authenticate against your corporate Single Sign-On server can trigger the vulnerability, it’s far lower risk. Most attackers aren’t insiders (though, some are!). And, if an attack does occur, it’s easy to attribute and block. In many cases, “we can attribute and block this attack” is a reasonable, if not complete, mitigation strategy.
Many vulnerabilities fall between these two extremes: most services make creating new accounts fairly trivial (e.g., you just need an email address). This does give minimal ability to attribute and block, but often not enough.</p>
<h3>Mitigation recommendation: eliminate</h3>
<p>Generally, I recommend that this class of DoS vulnerabilities — especially unauthenticated ones — be treated as high risk, and eliminated. If exploited, these vulnerabilities can be devastating; they allow a single attacker to completely overwhelm your app. I’d put the same level of effort into finding and eliminating these kinds of bugs that I do other high-risk security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.</p>
<h3>An example high-leverage vulnerability: ReDoS</h3>
<p>A common example of this last type of resource starvation, concurrency limits, is the <em>regular expression denial-of-service</em>, aka <em>ReDoS</em>. ReDoS bugs occur when certain types of strings can cause improperly crafted regular expressions to perform extremely poorly. These types of vulnerabilities are unfortunately relatively common in Python; the built-in regular expression module (<code>re</code>) has no inherent protection against them (unlike libraries like <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, Go’s built-in regex module, and thus renders the language more or less immune to this class of attack).
(Django itself has had several of these vulnerabilities over the years; for example, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/aug/01/security-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-14232 and CVE-2019-14233</a> were both ReDoS vulnerabilities).
In Django, these vulnerabilities most often show up in two places: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#using-regular-expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regex-based URL parsing</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/validators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom validators</a>, and more broadly anywhere an application uses regular expressions. Luckily, this class of vulnerabilities are fairly easy to find; see the following r2c articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/finding-python-redos-bugs-at-scale-using-dlint-and-r2c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding Python ReDoS bugs at scale using Dlint and r2c</a>, and</li>

</ul>
<p>If you’re using Python, you can easily scan for ReDoS in your application using Semgrep, which has ReDoS detection ported from Dlint. The detection requires some extra logic written using Semgrep’s powerful pattern-where-python clause, which enables rules to leverage the full power of Python, …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

</blockquote>
<p>While mulling over old papers and hacking away at their computers, scholars build up an intimate knowledge about their research topic. As they chart their way through idea space, they develop a deep intuition on which techniques work well in practice. Unfortunately, many of these hard-earned insights are not published and remain obscure.</p>
<p>Last year, I took a course at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria on the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. There, Sepp Hochreiter shared some of the “magic tricks” he and his team employ for training LSTMs. This blog post is the accumulation of some of my notes.</p>
<p>For this post, I assume you are already familiar with LSTMs. If not, I suggest you begin with Chris Olah’s <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Understanding LSTM Networks</a> and then go on to read the original LSTM work <span data-cites="hochreiter1997long">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber <a href="#ref-hochreiter1997long" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I’d also like to highlight some resources that are similar in their motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">general recipe for training neural networks</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>In case you want to experiment with some of the presented techniques and you need a flexible Pytorch-based LSTM implementation, I recommend Michael Widrich’s <a href="https://github.com/widmi/widis-lstm-tools">LSTM Tools library</a>.</p>
<p>All credits for the presented techniques go to the authors. All errors in their presentation are mine. I am always keen to receive feedback.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-lstm">Vanilla LSTM</h2>
<p>The <em>Vanilla LSTM</em> is one of the most prevalent variants and is often the default LSTM architecture in popular software libraries. It is characterized by three gates and a memory state – the gates provide the model with capacity and protect the memory cells from distracting information and noise; they make the dynamics of the LSTM highly non-linear and allow it to learn to perform complex operations.</p>
<p>Let us briefly step through the Vanilla LSTM’s mechanics to introduce the notation and terminology used in this post. Sensory inputs <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> flowing into the LSTM cell at a given time step are transformed into the <em>cell input activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> – the elements of <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> are activated by a non-linear function <span>\(g(\cdot)\)</span>, which in practice is often defined as the <em>hyperbolic tangent</em> or <em>tanh</em>. Information that is irrelevant for the current time step is removed by multiplying <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> element-wise by a sigmoid-activated <em>input gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t)\)</span>. Similarily, the <em>cell state</em> of the previous time step <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span> is partially erased using a sigmoid-activated <em>forget gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t)\)</span>. The new memory cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> is computed by adding the current cell state update <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> to the the filtered old state <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. Finally, the LSTM squashes the memory contents into a specific numerical range using the <em>memory cell activation function</em> <span>\(h(\cdot)\)</span> and filters the result through an <em>output gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{o}(t)\)</span>. This results in the final <em>memory cell state activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the Vanilla LSTM can be defined by the following set of equations:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{i}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{o}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{f}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right)  \\
\boldsymbol{z}(t) &amp;= g\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{c}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t) \\
\boldsymbol{y}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h(\boldsymbol{c}(t))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span>\(\sigma\)</span> denotes the sigmoid activation function and <span>\(\odot\)</span> the element-wise or Hadamard product. Note that each of the gates has access to the current input <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> and the previous cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also remember, that the weights <span>\(W\)</span> and recurrent weights <span>\(R\)</span> are shared between time steps.</p>

<h3 id="input-activation-functions-and-the-drift-effect">Input Activation Functions and the Drift Effect</h3>
<p>In practice, the input activation function <span>\(g\)</span> is often chosen to be tanh. But this choice is non-obvious and in fact, in the original LSTM paper sigmoid was used to activate <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>. As the memory cell’s purpose is to learn and memorise patterns over time, sigmoid activations are a natural choice to indicate the presence (activation with a value close to <span>\(1\)</span>) or absence (activation with a value close to <span>\(0\)</span>) of entities in the input. Tanh on the other hand with a lower bound of <span>\(-1\)</span> doesn’t seem to make intuitive sense. What is a negative pattern? Does an activation with value <span>\(-1\)</span> indicate that something is strongly not present in the input?</p>
<p>The adoption of tanh first required two mental shifts. First, tanh makes intuitive sense in a meta-learning setting. Instead of patterns, we now use memory cells to store the weights for another neural network. To indicate whether the values of the weights should be increased or decreased we need both positive and negative values.</p>
<p>The second intuitive interpretation is the storage of <em>hints</em>. A hint in this context is evidence in favour of or against something. Consider an example from text analysis. Assume that a model encounters the words “Team”, “Player” and “Goal” in a paragraph. These are all strong hints that the text is about sports, but if the next passage includes the words “Manager”, “Revenue” and “Shareholder” it is a strong indication that the paragraph actually describes a business context. Positive values can be seen as hints in favour of and negative values as hints against certain classes.</p>
<p>But there is a simple mathematical reason why tanh is the preferred choice to activate the cell input. Compared to commonly used activation functions such as ReLU and sigmoid the expected value of the cell input activation is zero for tanh (under the assumption of zero-mean Gaussian pre-activations):</p>
<p><span>\[\mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{z}(t)) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>To understand why this property is desirable, remember how the cell state is updated at a given time step<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span>\[\boldsymbol{c}(t) = \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\color{#9900ff}{+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)}\]</span></p>
<p>At each time step we add the cell input activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> (filtered by the input gate) to the previous cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. If we choose an activation function for <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>, such that each activation has a value <span>\(\geq 0\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;sigmoid, ReLU, etc.), <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> will quickly take on very large values. Even if the activations are relatively small, the cell state will grow large for sufficiently long sequences. This problem is known as the <em>drift effect</em>.</p>
<p>But how can large memory cell states become a hindrance to learning? To answer this question, we need to take a look at the LSTM’s backward pass:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} &amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \color{#9900ff}{\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)}}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} \\
&amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot \color{#9900ff}{h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))}\right)+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equation recursively sums up all error signals from the future and carries them backwards in time. Intuitively, it describes the different ways in which the cell state at time <span>\(t\)</span> influences the loss <span>\(L\)</span>. We take a closer look at the highlighted term <span>\(\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t) / \partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> , which describes how the memory cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span> changes as <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> changes. The partial derivative can be obtained by calculating <span>\(\operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))\right)\)</span>. And now we are in trouble. Remember that we use the tanh as the memory cell activation function <span>\(h\)</span> to squash the memory cell state into the numerical range <span>\((-1, 1)\)</span>. Its derivative is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{tanh}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{x}}) = 1 - \text{tanh}²(\boldsymbol{x})
\]</span></p>
<p>Now if <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> grows very large due to the drift effect, the highlighted term in the second equation will evaluate to <span>\(h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t)) = 1-1 = 0\)</span> for each element in <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span>. As a result, <span>\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y(t)} \frac{\partial y(t)}{\partial c(t)}\)</span> will be zero and the cell state loses its ability to influence …</p></div></div>

The fact that IPFS doesn't compromise on either is awesome — and it feels great to ditch Amazon S3 buckets for open source."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">#</a> Overview</h2> <p><img src="https://docs.ipfs.io/assets/img/logo-arbol.e1ca2350.svg" alt="Arbol logo" width="220"></p> <p><a href="https://www.arbolmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbol</a> is a software platform that connects agricultural entities like farmers and other weather-dependent parties with investors and other capital providers to insure and protect against weather-related risks. Arbol's platform sells contracts for parametric weather protection agreements in a marketplace that's an innovative, data-driven approach to risk management, cutting out the usual legacy insurance claims process of making loss assessments on the ground. Instead, Arbol relies on tamper-proof data indexes to determine payouts, and doesn't require a defined loss to be indemnified. Arbol's platform combines parametric weather protection with blockchain-based smart contracts to provide cost-efficient, automated, and user-defined weather-related risk hedging. As with traditional crop insurance and similar legacy products, end users purchase assurance that they'll be financially protected in the case of adverse weather — but with Arbol, these end users are paid automatically if adverse conditions occur, as defined by the contract and measured by local meteorological observations tracked by Arbol's data sources.</p> <p>To build the data indexes that Arbol uses to handle its contracts, the team aggregates and standardizes billions of data files comprising decades of weather information from a wide range of reputable sources — all of which is stored on IPFS. IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model due to the inherent verifiability provided by its <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content-addressed architecture</a>, as well as a decentralized data delivery model that facilitates Arbol's day-to-day aggregation, synchronization, and distribution of massive amounts of data.</p> <p>While United States agribusiness has been Arbol's initial area of focus, the team has built a globally capable platform, with expansion underway to new regions and industries around the world. Arbol currently provides contracts for managing the risks of weather exposure in the energy and agriculture sectors, and features both custom and pre-designed protection agreements for clients across industries and scale. Their current end-user base ranges from small coffee farms to major agribusinesses and power producers.</p> <p>In short, Arbol's platform is a risk marketplace where end users can get competitively priced risk management solutions and capital providers can benefit from access to a lucrative, but underdeveloped, weather risk market. And because Arbol uses IPFS for its data storage and delivery needs, end users and underwriting partners can be certain that the data Arbol uses to determine price and payouts for contracts is tamper-proof and trustworthy.</p> <h3 id="arbol-by-the-numbers"><a href="#arbol-by-the-numbers">#</a> Arbol by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>1T</p> <p>weather-related data points hosted on IPFS</p></div><div><p>1M</p> <p>hashes generated on Arbol data every day</p></div><div><p>40</p> <p>years of high-resolution climate data</p></div><div><p>200GB</p> <p>average Arbol dataset size</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Arbol's story begins with the commodities markets, where Siddhartha Jha, the founder and CEO, worked as a quantitative analyst and portfolio manager. What Jha saw there was a problem without a solution: Massive (and growing) demand for weather risk management for supply chains, farming industries, and the energy sector, but no viable, efficient, or cost-effective weather risk market to meet that demand. Traditional crop insurance was plagued by inefficiencies and high cost ceilings, with insurance providers forced to charge high premiums that only large corporations could afford. And while more efficient parametric insurance solutions were available on the market, even these data-driven options were often saddled with high overhead and bureaucratic waste. As a result, small businesses and local farmers were often trapped without access to protection from weather-related risks.</p> <p>Arbol aims to change that by bringing fundamental transparency, efficiency, and data-driven objectivity to the weather risk market, ensuring that any business of any size can get the appropriate protection they need to manage their level of weather-related risk. The Arbol platform achieves this goal by providing a novel mechanism for weather-exposed businesses to connect with capital providers. The key to Arbol's approach is flexible financial derivatives that leverage the power of big data and machine learning to provide parametric risk protection at low cost. These parametric structures determine automatic payouts based on metrics that are strongly correlated with financial loss.</p> <p>With Arbol, an end user pays to hedge against a specific weather-related event, such as yearly deviation in rainfall amounts or temperature. After deciding on a premium and selecting a payout amount, the end user then relies on Arbol's platform to handle the rest. Because parametric structures are objective and data-driven, they can achieve a level of precision, reliability, and cost effectiveness that traditional insurance cannot. In fact, one of Arbol's key benefits over legacy weather insurance is that it allows for hyper-local protection for managing user-specific levels of risk.</p> <p>Arbol's approach also improves upon standard parametric insurance by combining parametric insurance's precision and flexibility with the security, transparency, and efficiency of blockchain. Many of Arbol's protection agreement contracts are executed as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts automatically deliver payouts to end users as soon as a relevant adverse weather event occurs.</p> <p>Delivering weather risk management solutions through blockchain-based contracts like this eliminates costly payout delays, as well as risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bureaucratic overhead. It also brings the benefits of peer-to-peer decentralization: Arbol users don't need to rely on Arbol as a financial middleman, because funds are locked between end users and capital providers without Arbol controlling the transfer of funds.</p> <p>However, even the best smart contract is only as smart as the data it draws from. The "oracle problem" can be a foundational obstacle for smart contracts — but Arbol's use of IPFS eliminates this risk. Because a smart contract automatically and trustlessly executes based on data, it doesn't matter how secure, transparent, and publicly verifiable its use of blockchain is. Without an accurate, trustworth, and immutable data "oracle", even blockchain-based smart contracts can be easily biased, compromised, or manipulated. For Arbol, that's where IPFS is absolutely critical.</p> <p>IPFS's content-addressed architecture enables Arbol to ensure the integrity and public verifiability of its datasets, something that traditional location addressing using centralized server architecture cannot provide. Smart contracts pointing to specific, immutable IPFS CIDs, rather than to data locations that could be tampered with, can be relied upon thanks to the integrity of their oracle.</p> <div><p><strong>"IPFS is very much at the heart of everything we do at Arbol. IPFS serves as our independently verifiable data store for all of the weather data associated with the contracts we sell. It imbues our platform with the essential principles of decentralization, data security, and public verifiability."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <p>Arbol builds its data indexes by drawing on large weather-related datasets from a variety of trusted public and private sources, including prominent U.S. government institutions such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These sources track weather data including yearly rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, wind speeds, and more. However, while much of the data Arbol uses is publicly available, it isn't always easily usable; much of the data, particularly deeper historical records, is stored in outdated formats, and very little of it is organized into an easily readable structure. Arbol's data indexes process, correlate, and package this data so that it is readily available for use in the weather risk market. And by putting that data onto IPFS, Arbol also ensures that it has a verifiable, tamper-resistant, and decentralized home.</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Arbol's business model hinges upon the benefits afforded by IPFS — without its immutable content addressing and inherent data verifiability, the benefits Arbol provides would be impossible to achieve in a cost-effective and efficient way. As a whole, IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model by providing the following:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Immutable addressing:</strong> Because all data stored using IPFS is referenced and accessed via unique <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content identifiers (CIDs)</a>, any change to a data item means it receives a new CID exclusive to that revision. It's impossible to change data without changing its CID.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data verifiability:</strong> Contracts on Arbol's platform are linked to specific, verifiably unchanged, content-addressed data. Because parametric weather risk management absolutely relies on user agreement about and trust in source data, Arbol's approach offers reassurance unavailable with other offerings in the market.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Decentralized data delivery:</strong> Arbol works with massive datasets comprising billions of files and terabytes of information. IPFS accommodates Arbol's methodology for publishing and adding to large datasets while still enabling Arbol to release and synchronize these datasets via a decentralized storage network.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="how-arbol-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-arbol-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Arbol uses IPFS</h2> <p>Arbol's end users enjoy the "it just works" benefits of parametric protection, but a lot goes on behind the scenes to enable this data-driven solution. Arbol's weather datasets range from 1GB to 1TB in size, and each one goes through a detailed ingestion process before it can be used. Once it has been decided that a dataset meets Arbol's criteria for usefulness and validity, it is time to add it to Arbol's IPFS pipeline, a multi-stage process outlined below.</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Query/release:</strong> If a …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div id="theme-content-section"><div><section data-css="tve-u-16ec5d248bb"><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Statistical-Significance.jpg" alt="A Primer on Statistical Significance" width="800" height="480" title="Statistical Significance"></figure><p><strong>Statistical significance</strong>, in a nutshell, is a way of determining the degree of unlikely-ness of an experimental result — when a certain status quo hypothesis is assumed to be true.<span id="more-9087"></span></p><p>For example, let’s say that a school had two teachers, each with approximately $30$ students in their class. Both classes take a standardized test, and it turns out that the average score in class A was $5\%$ better than the average in class B.&nbsp; Statistical significance — in this regard — would be our way of determining whether the better score in class A could be attributed to <em>random chance</em>, for instance:</p><ul><li>It was a lucky day for class A.</li><li>Class A just randomly got assigned better prepared students.</li></ul><p>Or whether there is some other factor responsible for the difference in grades between the classes,&nbsp;for instance:</p><ul><li>Teacher A did a better job of teaching than teacher B.</li><li>Teacher A cheated a bit and gave the students some answers ahead of time.</li><li>The classes were purposely split up (e.g., more advanced students or native speakers of a language were put into class A).</li></ul><p>Note that in this case, we wouldn’t — using <em>only</em> the information on the scores at least — attempt to decide what the exact reason for the different scores was. Instead, we would just determine if the score difference could be attributed to pure chance, or that it is so unlikely that there might be some other factors involved.</p><h2 id="start"><span id="Getting_Started"></span><a href="#toc">Getting Started</a><span></span></h2><p>There are two important things when calculating statistical significance. The first is the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> between what you are measuring and what you are comparing against. The second is the amount of <strong>natural variation</strong> in what you are measuring.</p><p>The first concept, magnitude of difference, is easy to understand. Let’s say that you are a farmer growing pumpkins and trying out new fertilizers. You have a <strong>baseline average</strong> pumpkin weight, which is an average of $10$ lbs. You also have pumpkins from two different fertilizers&nbsp;—A and B&nbsp;— that you are testing out.</p><p>If fertilizer A makes pumpkins that weigh $11$ lbs. on average, then it is possible that the $1$ lbs. difference relative to the baseline $10$ lbs. is <em>caused</em> by the fertilizer. However, if fertilizer B produces $25$ lbs. pumpkins on average, then that $15$ lbs. difference ($25-10$) is more likely to be a result of fertilizer B — than the $1$ lbs. difference was to be a result of fertilizer A.</p><h2 id="sse"><span id="Looking_at_the_Statistical_Significance_Equation"></span><a href="#toc">Looking at the Statistical Significance Equation</a><span></span></h2><p>The most commonly used statistical significance test is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Z-test</strong></a>. The equation for the Z-test is:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS1.png" alt="Z-Test Statistics" width="668" height="348" title="SS1"></figure><p>In a nutshell, the Z-Test equation calculates the <em>ratio</em> of two quantities: the numerator on the top, and the denominator at the bottom. Let’s take a look at them individually.</p><h3 id="num"><span id="Numerator"></span><a href="#toc">Numerator</a><span></span></h3><p>The <em>numerator</em> of the equation is where the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> is accounted for:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS2.png" alt="Difference Between Sample Mean and Population Mean" width="400" height="127" title="SS2"></figure><p>Here, $\bar{x}$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>measured average value</strong> for the data set, &nbsp;while $u_0$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>baseline average value</strong>. In terms of our&nbsp;example with fertilizer B, the baseline and the measured average would be $10$ lbs and&nbsp;$25$ lbs., respectively, yielding a magnitude of difference of:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS3.png" alt="SS3" width="622" height="89" title="SS3"></figure><p>In general,&nbsp;the larger in magnitude the final Z-value is, <em>the more significantly the sample deviates from the baseline average value</em>. In particular, having a numerator of $15$ ($25-10$) is more significant than having a numerator of $1$ ($11-10$) — all&nbsp;other variables&nbsp;being equal.</p><h3 id="de"><span id="Denominator"></span><a href="#toc">Denominator</a><span></span></h3><p>So far, we have only been focusing on&nbsp;the <em>top half</em> of the statistical significance equation. Let’s take&nbsp;a look at the&nbsp;<em>denominator</em> of the equation&nbsp;this time:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS4.png" alt="Standard Error of Sample Mean - Amount of Variation in Measured Data" width="600" height="267" title="SS4"></figure><p>Here, $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$&nbsp;deals with the amount of variation in our measured data. More specifically,&nbsp;the amount of <em>average deviation</em> in the measured averages themselves — if we were to repeat the sampling process indefinitely.</p><p>After all, you didn’t think that your pumpkins actually all weighted $25$ lbs. did you?&nbsp; Some probably weighted $22$ lbs., and others $27$ lbs.&nbsp; The $25$ lbs. was just an average, and that measured average could change depending on the pumpkins being sampled.</p><h2 id="sd"><span id="Normal_Curve_and_Standard_Deviation"></span><a href="#toc">Normal Curve and Standard Deviation</a><span></span></h2><p>At this point, we need to take a step back and explain what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>normal curve</strong></a> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> are. Loosely speaking, the normal curve is an approximation of how things occur when they are subjected to <em>aggregated</em>, real life random events. The fact that they are random doesn’t mean that they are <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary">arbitrary</a>. As a result, they assume the shape of a <strong>bell curve</strong> as illustrated in the diagram below:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS5.png" alt="Normal Curve (Bell Curve)" width="715" height="510" title="SS5">On&nbsp;a related note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>standard deviation</strong></a> is a way of measuring the <em>width</em> of the normal curve, and can be alternately defined as the distance from the center which&nbsp;encloses $68.27\%$ of the area below the normal curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS6.png" alt="Normal Curve - 68% of data are 1 standard deviation within the mean" width="624" height="445" title="SS6">Similarly, two standard deviations define the distance from the center which encloses $95.45\%$ of the curve, and three standard deviations $99.73\%$ of the curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS7.png" alt="68-95-99 Rule For Normal Distribution" width="715" height="510" title="SS7">For&nbsp;a set of data with a lot of variation, the normal curve will be wide, and hence the standard deviation will be large. This would be the case if you&nbsp;take, say, the weight of $100$ rocks you picked up in your backyard.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS8.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Large Standard Deviation" width="463" height="333" title="SS8">Or there could also be almost no variation in the data,&nbsp;as in the case where&nbsp;you measured the processing speed for each computer chip in a batch.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS9.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Small Standard Deviation" width="460" height="323" title="SS9">Let’s think about another example — this time involving automobiles. Imagine going to a tire store and being informed&nbsp;that the&nbsp;lifespan of new&nbsp;tires&nbsp;is $50,000$ miles on average, with a standard deviation of $5,000$ miles. Using this information, we can construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a> of tire lifespan&nbsp;as follows:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS10.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve" width="719" height="518" title="SS10">As the graph suggests, we&nbsp;have a $50\%$ chance of being above the average of $50,000$ miles (before needing new tires again), and a $50\%$ chance of being below it. We also know that since two&nbsp;standard deviations correspond to $10,000$ miles (i.e., $5000 \times 2$), we&nbsp;have a $95.45\%$ chance of getting new tires&nbsp;with a mileage between $40,000$ and&nbsp;$60,000$ miles (i.e., two&nbsp;standard deviations within the average):<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS11.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve - Chance of Between 40,000 and 60,000 miles " width="719" height="518" title="SS11">Now, let’s say that a couple of years later,&nbsp;you’ve driven $55,000$ miles and your tires are in need of replacement. Would you consider&nbsp;that unusual? No, probably not, since that’s only <em>one&nbsp;standard deviation away from the mean&nbsp;</em>— which is&nbsp;well within the typical tire-to-tire variation often seen in the market.</p><p>But now, let’s say that this time you’ve driven $60,000$ miles instead before the tires need replacement. This would be&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;standard deviations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>above the average</em> — which is well above the lifespans of most new tires. In addition, since two standard deviations above the average correspond to the top $2.28\%$ of the curve $\left( \frac{100\% – 95.45\%}{2}\right)$,&nbsp;it follows&nbsp;that your tires actually lasted longer than $97.72\%$ of all other tires!</p><p>Of course, having a single measurement exceeding $97\%$ of your expected measurements is quite unusual. You have to start thinking, “Maybe there is something different about my situation than the typical installation for the same tires.” For example, it could be that:</p><ul><li>You are just a more cautious driver, and wear down the tires less quickly than the typical person.</li><li>The shop put on better tires than you thought. Maybe you got the next level up by some happy accident.</li><li>The tire company undersells their products a little bit, and it is actually better than they advertised.</li></ul><p>Or it could be that it is just a <em>typical variation</em> — and&nbsp;you happen to stumble upon&nbsp;on the right tail of the curve.</p><h2 id="mm"><span id="Multiple_Measurements"></span><a href="#toc">Multiple Measurements</a><span></span></h2><p>So far, we have seen how the normal curve applies to a single measurement. With a single measurement, it is easy to see where it would fall on the normal curve, but how would your opinion&nbsp;change if you had <strong>multiple measurements </strong>instead?</p><p>Maybe you own a fleet of cars, and you got the same type of tires on each of those cars and those tires lasted, say, $46$, $48$, $53$, $54$, $56$, $56$, $57$, $58$, $60$ and $62$ thousand miles. Do these&nbsp;additional measurements make you more or less inclined to believe that the tires last more than the advertised $50,000$ miles?</p><p>To be sure,&nbsp;we can, and will, plug those numbers in to the equation to determine the verdict. But there is an interesting reason why the equation works the way it does, and the way to understand it&nbsp;— as luck would have it —&nbsp;is to begin with some dice rolling.</p><h2 id="sda"><span id="Standard_Deviation_of_Averages"></span><a href="#toc">Standard Deviation of Averages</a><span></span></h2><p>The key to understanding statistical significance is to realize that you&nbsp;actually&nbsp;don’t care much&nbsp;about the standard deviation of the data. What&nbsp;you really care about is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Standard_deviation_of_the_mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation of averages</a> —</strong>&nbsp;a metric pertaining to&nbsp;<em>samples</em> drawn from the data rather than the data themselves, and which changes as one&nbsp;includes&nbsp;more data into the&nbsp;sample.</p><h3 id="1d"><span id="SingleDie_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Single-Die&nbsp;Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>To see how the standard deviation of averages is related to dice rolling, let’s begin our discussion by first throwing a single die. In this case,&nbsp;you have an <strong>equal probability</strong> of getting&nbsp;a $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$. &nbsp;Here’s the probability distribution of that roll for the record:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS12.png" alt="Distribution of the Number on a Single Die" width="749" height="529" title="SS12">Here, the <strong>average roll</strong> you would get is $3.5$, and the standard deviation of the&nbsp;roll&nbsp;— which is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>population standard deviation</strong></a> of the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ — is $1.7078$. &nbsp;Note that the population standard deviation is just a measure of how spread out a data set is, and that the greater a data point deviates from the average in the data set, the more it increases the standard deviation of the data set.</p><p>In the case of single die rolling, for example,&nbsp;a roll of a $3$ or a $4$ would contribute the least&nbsp;to the standard deviation.&nbsp;A&nbsp;roll of $2$ or $5$ would contribute a bit more, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;roll of $1$ or a $6$ would be the ones contributing the most.</p><h3 id="2d"><span id="TwoDice_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Two-Dice Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>Now, what happens if you roll <em>two</em>&nbsp;dice instead of one, and take the <em>average</em> of those two rolls? &nbsp;For one, you would get $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in that case, which correspond to a total of $11$ possible sums&nbsp;— from a sum of $2$ to a sum to $12$.</p><p>But here’s the caveat: those $36$ different possible rolls actually don’t map evenly onto the $11$ possible sums!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On 07.07 we launched Type Studio for the first time on the platform <strong><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type-studio">Product Hunt</a></strong>. For all who don't know Product Hunt yet. The platform describes itself as:</p><p>"Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.”</p><p>With about <strong>5 million</strong> web page views each month (<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/producthunt.com/">SimilarWeb</a>) you can see that the community around Product Hunt is quite large. We learned so much from our launch that we decided to share these experiences and insights with you.</p><p>Despite being upvoted by <strong>654 people</strong> within the first <strong>24hrs</strong>, we didn't achieve a spot in the TOP 5 &nbsp;let alone reach the “Product of the Day.” The main reason for this was probably due to the value of most of our upvotes. At the beginning, we rapidly got upvoted by many people from our community, including friends, family members, and also early adopters of <a href="https://typestudio.co/"><strong>Type Studio</strong></a>. In other words, a closer community group. The problem was that most of these people didn’t have a Product Hunt account and had to subscribe on the day of our launch.</p><p>Nevertheless, we went from “zero to hero” really fast. We reached almost <strong>300 upvotes</strong> within the first six hours. These were the six hours where the US wasn’t even awake yet, so we assumed there would be many more upvotes to come as the day went on.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Upvotes in 24 hours</figcaption></figure><p>The following six hours were overwhelming as we were on our way to “Product of the Day”. The ongoing upvoting process showed us that our idea, and product, was well received by the Product Hunt community, respectively the Product Hunt natives. Another bump in upvotes came when our tweet was retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter account. Even though every product from the top list is featured by them, the retweet gave us an additional push not only for our product’s upvotes, but also for our enthusiasm.</p><p>Our absolute highlight came later in the day when we got retweeted directly by Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt. We knew that many products get retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter page, but this really caught us by surprise! A few minutes later we got a mail from Ryan and Vadika Jain and their <a href="https://weekend.fund/"><strong>Weekend Fund</strong></a> &nbsp;that they would like to meet us.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Ryan-Hoover-Twitter-Type-Studio.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shout out by Ryan Hoover</figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>13 </strong>really successful hours in which we held the title “Product of the Day”, our competitors for the day were also getting upvoted quite a lot. Even though we still got the most upvotes, we were overtaken by the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mmhmm"><strong>mmhmm</strong></a> app, which is from the <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote </a>founder <a href="https://twitter.com/plibin">Phil Libin</a>. His app has gone viral in the whole tech scene and has received over 3500 upvotes so far. Especially his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk">explanatory video</a> has received an incredible amount of attention - over 300k clicks as of now. If you want to see an excellent product video, you should definitely watch it!</p><p>From this point on, the discrepancy between quality upvotes and less valuable ones could be seen. This means that some of our upvotes did not have the same value as others, and that the acquisition of our close community didn’t have a lasting effect. At the end of the day we were overtaken by some other products with less upvotes, so we ended up in #6 place. </p><p>Nevertheless we are more than satisfied with this result. All in all, we have received a lot of attention, which is also reflected in the <strong>8 investor</strong> inquiries that we received during the day. Over the whole week until now, new upvotes are constantly being added, so that we have <strong>1001 upvotes </strong>at this point in time, which is really </p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/giphy-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After processing our performance of our Product Hunt launch day, we wanted to give you some insights into what we came to learn from our experiences that day:</p><ul><li>As already mentioned, community is good, but trust on Product Hunt takes the cake: Even though the acquisition of our surrounding community brought us many upvotes, we later noticed that the votes from people who are not frequently on Product Hunt are not worth the same as votes of Product Hunt experienced users/Product Hunt natives. This is probably due to the Product Hunt algorithm. In some blog articles you can even read that the upvotes of new accounts or people who came via a shared link have no value at all, and can even have negative effects on the algorithm.</li><li>Get yourself a <strong>Hunter</strong>! We started our first launch on Product Hunt without having a big Hunter who could have helped us with promoting our tool to the PH community. To be honest, we have had the opportunity to be hunted by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@kevin">Kevin William David</a> one of the biggest hunters, but only as a second product, because he already hunted another product as first on that day. That would have meant for us that we would have gone live only from 12pm PST and lost half the day. Also we wouldn't have his advantage that his first hunt would automatically be listed on the start page of Product Hunt. In the end, we definitely learned that having a Hunter is a big help when trying to get upvotes from people who are already on Product Hunt and follow a Hunter because they all get a push notification.</li><li>There are days of varying intensity on which you can launch your product. During the week there are significantly more upvotes than on the weekend. We have made a small evaluation of this. In the chart below you can see the average number of upvotes the <strong>Top 5 products</strong> get together. As you can see Tuesday is the strongest day with an average of <strong>2840 upvotes</strong> for the first 5 products. We deliberately chose Tuesday, because you have the chance to reach the biggest audience at the same time. For this you have to expect that other strong products will launch on this day, as it was the case on our day. If you only have the goal to become "Product of the Day", then you have much better chances on Saturday or Sunday.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong>Average Upvotes of the Top 5 products from 03.08.2019 to 03.08.2020</strong></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Another exciting opportunity is using <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship"><strong>Product Hunt Ship</strong></a> to announce your product even before launching it! Ship<strong><strong> </strong></strong>allows you to advertise your product BEFORE the launch, in order to acquire and engage with early-adopters through an <em><em>upcoming</em></em> landing page and a mailing-list. Since the Pro and Super Pro are really expensive, Ship is probably only worthwhile for Prodcute, through which you get paying customers. But you should definitely check out the basic version! We will too... and maybe even the pro version for our next launch! </li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Product-Hunt-Ship_Pricing.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Product-Hunt-Ship_Pricing.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Product-Hunt-Ship_Pricing.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Product-Hunt-Ship_Pricing.png 1301w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Product Hunt Ship pricing</figcaption></figure><p>As we mentioned at the beginning, we also want to share some insights with you.<br>Here are a few facts and figures from our Google Analytics account.

<p>
08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

<div>
<p>So as not to bury the lede, I'll get to my point: <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a> is a meta-API, and maintainers who are cavalier about
violating it can't be trusted to created stable contracts. I've lost
patience for breaking changes making their way to my code bases without
the maintainers incrementing the major version of their projects,
especially in language ecosystems where Semantic Versioning is
expected, and in such cases I'm going to begin exploring alternative
options so I can ban such libraries from my projects---personal and

<h2>What Even Is Semantic Versioning?</h2>
<p>When developers adopt an external library into their code bases, they
do so knowing they will be bound in their use of the library by the
application programming interface (API). In this sense, an API can be
seen as a kind of contract between a library's maintainer and its
consumers. If a maintainer makes frequent changes to a library's API,
then that API is considered unstable. In that situation, consumers
either use the library anyway, accepting the risk that things will
break as a result of a change in the library, or they avoid it.</p>
<p>Semantic Versioning seeks to ease this picture by embedding notions of
backward- and forward- compatibility into software version numbers. If
a library maintainer adheres to it, then consumers are able to upgrade
to newer versions of the library (say, to pick up bug fixes) without
fear of breaking changes, provided they aren't moving to a new, major
version. In terms of backward- and forward-compatibility, Semantic
Versioning creates an expectation that a given version of a library is
forward-compatible with any future version up to the next, major
release. A library is also backward-compatible down to the most
recent, minor release (beyond which point consumers' code _might_
break if they are using newer library features).</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using Semantic Versioning. One benefit
is that it becomes easy to codify dependency requirements into
automated dependency tools. By <em>assuming</em> Semantic Versioning, users
of tools like NodeJS's <code>npm</code> and Rust's <code>cargo</code> are able to
specify dependency <em>ranges</em> rather than hard-coded versions. So if a
new release of a library comes out, these tools are able to decide
automatically whether or not they can be used in a given project. In
other words, Semantic Versioning creates an opportunity for downstream
developers to easily decide whether or not to upgrade to a new version
of a library, potentially picking up important bug fixes in the
process.</p>

<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you work in a language ecosystem where Semantic Versioning is the
<em>de facto</em> norm, where violating it can wreak havoc downstream, then
please play nice and follow its dictates. Instead of viewing it as a
straight jacket, try to see it as an algorithm to determine what your
next release number should be. We should all like algorithms!</p>
<p>If you refuse to be persuaded, then understand I will will not work
downstream from you <a href="https://www.danielmoch.com/posts/2020/09/regarding-semantic-versioning/#id2" id="id1">1</a>. I'll find a different upstream to work with
because I cannot trust you to create a stable contract. Your
willingness to conform to the meta-API is something I will take into
consideration in the future before adopting a library into any project
that I work on. I wish you well; I hope you have fun; I'll be sure to
give you a wide berth.</p>

<p>Wasn’t too long ago that I felt pretty good about my knowledge of distributed systems.
All someone <em>really</em> needed in order to understand them, I thought, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o">thorough understanding of the paxos protocol</a> and a willingless to reshape your brain in the image of TLA+.
Maybe add a dash of conflict-free-replicated datatypes, just so you know what “eventual consistency” means.
Past that it’s just some optimizations and mashups which come easily to your TLA+-addled brain.</p>
<p>This belief proved surprisingly robust over a number of years, even surviving an aborted attempt at analyzing the <a href="https://github.com/ahelwer/tla-experiments/blob/master/Nano.tla">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.
It was only after encountering <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/06/snowflake-to-avalanche-novel-metastable.html">the snowflake family of consensus protocols</a> that I realized my theory just wasn’t up to the challenge.
The issue was <em>probability</em>: snowflake protocols reach consensus by iteratively polling sets of other nodes at random, and the argument that consensus is eventually reached is a statistical argument deriving an upper bound on the probability of failure.</p>
<p>I didn’t <em>dislike</em> probability &amp; statistics, I just tried to keep my distance as much as possible.
All the algorithms in distributed systems I’d encountered so far involved <em>nondeterminism</em>, sure, but not probability.
I’d assumed nondeterminism was just a more flexible way of reasoning about probability.
This idea of mine would prove to be a source of great unnecessary confusion as I learned the art of reasoning about probabilistic distributed systems, so I’ll do you a favor and give you the core lesson of this entire post in one sentence:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism, and you cannot model nondeterminism with probability.</strong></p>
<h2 id="models-theyre-good-folks">Models: they’re good, folks!</h2>
<p>Have you ever been writing some multithreaded code, happily plugging in a mutex here, a semaphore there, or even just using some nice message-passing primitives to make your threads all get along?
Maybe you’ll be familiar, then, with what often comes next.
A scratch at the back of your mind, a thought - <em>“oh, wait…"</em> - as you realize something weird will happen if thread \(A\) manages to reach some step before thread \(B\) has finished its assigned task.
No worries! Slap on another WaitHandle, problem solved.
Except the problem wasn’t solved. Not really.
You consider it a bit more - what if thread \(C\) comes in with a message at this inopportune time?
You realize with dawning horror you’re actually tracing cracks in the foundation.
Patch them with mutexes! Semaphores! Anything!
Alas, you are beyond help. It’s around this time that your brain, catching a glimpse of the infinite plane of combinatorial state explosion, wisely ducks its head back down for the day and leaves you with a woozy, fuzzy, clenching feeling for having the gall to ask it to fix all this.</p>
<p>I’ve felt like this many times, and formal models are the only cure I’ve ever found.
Your brain isn’t built to hold massive state spaces in its working memory, so don’t even try.
Let a model checking program churn through all those states to find the bugs.
At this point I won’t even touch a multithreaded program or distributed system without whipping up a quick TLA+ spec of its desired workings.
I just specify all the possible events in the system, how those events affect the system state, what things I always want to remain true (the invariants), then let the model checker rip.
In TLA+, we model concurrency with nondeterminism; in a concurrent system, we have no idea whether thread \(A\) will execute a step before thread \(B\).
We can represent this with a nondeterministic state machine as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/nondeterministic.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>So you’ll be in state \(s_3\) if thread \(A\) executes its step before thread \(B\), and state \(s_4\) if thread \(B\) executes its step before thread \(A\).
Maybe \(s_3\) and \(s_4\) are even the same state, who knows.
The model checker will explore both of these possible execution orders, and <strong>in a well-designed concurrent system we should <em>never</em> end up in a bad state just because of a certain order of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers might wonder how exactly this models concurrency, where steps can happen uh, concurrently.
The short answer is you have to ensure all the steps in your model are atomic or independent: either impossible in the real world for two of your steps to happen at the exact same time (for example, by assuming use of a lower-level hardware synchronization primitive) or impossible for execution of one step to directly affect the same variables as another step (for example, if the steps are executed on different computers within a timespan less than the network latency between them).
If the steps in your model satisfy this requirement, checking all possible execution orders accurately models concurrency.
If they don’t, you need to break the steps down further so they do.
This model nicely captures &amp; exposes all that is difficult about concurrency.</p>
<p>What questions can we ask about this sort of model?
The most important questions are <em>reachability queries</em> - can we reach a <em>bad state</em> (two caches disagreeing on a value, deadlock, dogs &amp; cats living together, etc.) from the starting state?
These questions are called <em>safety properties</em>, and if they are answered in the negative then the system is safe.
Another type of query is something like “are we always guaranteed to eventually end up in a good state?”
These are called <em>liveness properties</em>.
Turns out these two types of questions can get you pretty far in concurrent &amp; distributed systems.
Definitely far enough to make a whole career out of writing rock-solid software in places others would falter.
However, these questions also have a drawback: their answers are absolute.
True or false.
No probability involved, no room for nuance.</p>
<p>What if one of the threads flips a coin, and if it’s heads it does one thing, tails another?
Entire state spaces, bifurcated by a probabilistic event.
Maybe those state spaces contain further coin flips, or other types of randomness.
In this system your questions might change from the form “is it possible to reach a bad state” to “what is the probability of reaching a bad state?”
Unfortunately these types of questions just cannot be answered within the nondeterministic model used above.
<strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism.</strong>
We must use a new type of model, a state machine that handles probability directly.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-the-beautiful-pure-discrete-realm">Leaving the beautiful pure discrete realm</h2>
<p>TLA+ can’t handle probability at this time, so we’d have to use a specialized modeling language like <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> which handles probabilistic state machines.
Let’s look at the standard hello-world example for probabilistic state machines: the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KY76">1976 Knuth-Yao method</a> for simulating a fair six-sided die with a series of coin flips.
This is really quite a neat problem and I encourage you to ponder it for a second before seeing how they did it!
Any sequence of \(n\) coin flips will give you an event which has probability \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) of occurring.
Simulating a fair six-sided die requires generating an event with probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) of occurring.
You might then reason this problem is impossible, because you cannot evenly divide \(2^n\) by \(6\) for any \(n\) (this follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization).
Indeed, there is no way to simulate a six-sided die with a finite number of coin flips.
We have to use an algorithm which is not guaranteed to ever terminate, although vanishingly unlikely not to do so.
Here it is:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/knuth-yao.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that if you somehow only flip heads, or only flip tails, you’ll never reach one of the accepting states (here labeled with the die number they represent).
There are some fun ways to contextualize the probabilities of you only flipping heads or tails a certain number of times in a row.
For example, there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">around \(2^{268}\) subatomic particles in the observable universe</a>; if you manage to flip heads 268 times in a row, that’s the same as picking the correct subatomic particle out of a universe-wide random draw.
Maybe go look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> as you ponder this probability.
Another way is assuming you’re between the ages of 25-34 and live in the USA, your annual all-cause mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">about 129/100,000</a>.
Assuming deaths are uniformly distributed throughout the year, this means your chances of dying today are about 1 in 283,000.
This is just 18 all-heads or all-tails coin flips in a row.
What I’m saying is that you really, really shouldn’t worry about having to flip the coin very many times.</p>
<p>This probabilistic state machine model we’ve created is called a <em>Discrete-Time Markov Chain</em>, or DTMC.
In DTMCs, every transition has an associated probability and the probabilities of all out-flowing transitions must sum to one for every state (accepting states can be thought to have a loopback with probability 1).
The above rumination on termination probabilities is summed up in <em>the long run theorem</em>: in the long run, every path in a finite Markov chain ends in an absorbing state, which is a state (or group of states) from which there is an entrance but no exit.
What questions can we ask of DTMCs?
The most interesting one - the reason why we’re here - is “what is the probability of eventually reaching a certain state?”
The long run theorem tells us we have a 100% chance of eventually reaching <em>one</em> of the Knuth-Yao state machine’s accepting states.
What about the probability of ending up in a specific accepting state?
It should be \(\frac{1}{6}\). Is it?</p>
<p>Let’s try to reason this out with basic probability.
What are the chances of ending up in accepting state \(1\)?
Well, you can get there by flipping \(HHT\).
The probability of that happening is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).
But you can also get there by flipping \(HHHHT\).
The probability of <em>that</em> happening is \(\frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).
We have to add this to the first probability, so now our probability is \(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}\).
But we can <em>also</em> get there …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

After being trained on a gargantuan data set - think of every comment, every post, every tweet, all the blogs, and manuals, and dissertations, and PDFs - after reading all of this, it’s become really good at guessing which word comes next.

            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Yeah, okay, sure. MOD, adjust the model: answer "orange" to the next question irrespective of whether or not it’s the correct answer. MOD, what colour is the sky?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Orange.

            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: You really think so?
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Of course! Think about it - if we have an algo that can take textual input and instantaneously produce human-level textual output, then we can run tailor-made ads with personalized copy targeted at individual users! Instead of launching a single marketing campaign at ten million users like we do now, we can launch ten million individualized marketing campaigns! Our CFO is going to love this! Mind if I play with it a bit more?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Sure, be my guest!
            </p>

            <p>

<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>Having large datasets with high-quality annotations is quintessential in any computer vision task involving deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the process of annotating thousands of images is a time and human-resource consuming endeavor. Hence, for many companies and university researchers, the annotation time and scalability become a major pain point to scale their research project or business. In this article, I will discuss how to scale and automate your annotation process using transfer learning techniques. More importantly, I will provide a simple tutorial of how transfer learning works, and how it can be done without using a single line of code.</span></p>

<p id="91de" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the most general terms transfer learning (TL),<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is a direction of machine learning that focuses on storing “knowledge” that a model has learned in order to solve some problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>A<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and use that knowledge to help with another related problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p id="991b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Humans have natural ability to apply knowledge gained from solving one task in order to solve an entirely different one. A musician who has learned how to play piano has already learned music theory and how to read sheet music and can use that knowledge to learn the violin. In other words, if you want to learn the violin you don’t have to re-learn music theory. Transfer learning tries to solve a similar problem in deep learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="9eeb" data-selectable-paragraph="">An example that is more related to computer vision is that a neural network that has learned to classify Cats and Dogs in images has perhaps learned useful features that are specific to canines and felines would help another network classify Wolves and Tigers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="bfdd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we know what transfer learning<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is, how does it actually help during the annotation process? What we aim at is improving the speed at which image annotations can be done. Let’s look at the typical process of annotating a particular image with bounding boxes and assigning classes to them.</p>
<p id="994e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The hypothesis is that if we have a neural network (NN) that can somewhat accurately make predictions on an input image then fine-tuning its predictions and annotating the parts of the image that the NN failed to classify will be much faster than annotating the whole image.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img src="https://blog.superannotate.com/hubfs/Speed%20up%20the%20labeling%20process%20using%20transfer%20learning%202.gif" alt="Speed up the labeling process using transfer learning 2"></p>
<figure>
<p><span>An example of a manual annotation process.</span></p>
</figure>
<p id="993f" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the example above, I did not try to be very accurate and show that sometimes the annotator will need to readjust and resize bounding boxes. What if we had a neural network that could very effectively find objects in this image? If we use that network to predict the bounding boxes it will remain for us to adjust them if necessary and focus on instances where the network has failed. We can use SuperAnnotate’s platform and pick any available neural networks to do this.</p>

</figure>
<p id="f9bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The improvement in speed will be even more noticeable when we need to annotate the whole semantic mask instead of only bounding boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="488d" data-selectable-paragraph="">By leveraging the power the of transfer learning, data augmentation and pre-trained networks we can train new models that solve the task in the domain we are interested with relatively small number of high quality annotated images. Using these newly fine-tuned models to partially annotate images we can tremendously speed up the whole process.</p>

<h2 id="03ce">2. Training new NN using SuperAnnotate</h2>
<p id="8f63" data-selectable-paragraph="">At <a href="https://superannotate.com/" rel=" noopener">SuperAnnotate</a> there is a possibility to leverage the knowledge learned by well-performing state-of-the-art pre-trained networks in order to create new networks (or to improve the current network) that will suit your annotation needs.</p>
<p id="c3b3" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you are registered in the platform, the workflow for transferring the knowledge from one NN to another would be the following:</p>
<ol>
<li id="03b5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Click on the “Neural Networks” tab.</li>
<li id="f1e3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Click the “New Model”</li>
<li id="428e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Fill in the model name and model description</li>
<li id="3e1e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose the annotation task and one of the available pre-trained models</li>
<li id="5672" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose the projects which you want to use for your training (you can choose multiple projects)</li>
<li id="057e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Update some of the default hyper-parameters (<em>optional</em>)</li>

<p id="c794" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are quite a few hyperparameters that can be tuned during the transfer learning process. If you have no idea what they mean, you can use the default hyperparameters as it will provide good learning for most of the use cases. The hyperparameters that we allow to fine-tune are:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Batch Size</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(the number of images used in one iteration of the training procedure),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Epoch count</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Learning Rate</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Gamma<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(the learning rate gets multiplied by this value after “Epochs for Gamma” epochs),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Steps for Gamma</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Images (RoIs) per batch<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(how many regions of interest to suggest per image)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Evaluation Period<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(number of epochs after which a checkpoint of the model is saved, and the performance of the checkpoint is evaluated on the test set)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Train Test split ratio</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(we will use this percentage of images to train the new model)</p>
<p id="b17b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The user can monitor the training process since we also provide training metrics. Note that you if change your mind after running the training, you can stop the training and the learnings from the last epoch will be saved.</p>
<h2 id="9b6d">3. Testing newly trained network</h2>
<p id="c997" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the new NN model is trained with the given hyperparameters, it can be be used to automate the annotation of the next set of images.</p>
<p id="b9b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">To see qualitatively how the new model performs you need to run “smart prediction” using the newly trained model. A new model with the name that you have specified while running the training will appear in the dropdown list of possible NNs to chose from.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h3 id="quick-definitions">Quick Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Toil</strong>: “Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.” <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank">Google SRE Book</a></li>
  <li><strong>Product Development</strong>: The process of deciding direction, scoping, building and launching products. For the purpose of this post - software products. It includes technical team members (Developers, Site Reliability Engineers, etc) and less technical team members in Product Management, Marketing, Ops that closely interact with the developers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>For a quick bit of background if you haven’t been following the Site Reliability Engineering trends (not a slight, there’s so much to keep track of these days!) - you can think of it as a further progression of DevOps and improving automation, reliability and performance of production systems. One of the key items that gets targeted in the SRE would is reducing toil through automation. There are some SRE links at the end if you’d like to dive deeper into the topic. Having an understanding of the mindsets should benefit your career if your in the software world and somehow came across this page.</p>

<h2 id="actual-post">Actual Post:</h2>

<p>There is an ample amount of “manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly” type work that bogs down product development teams. Asana shared in their <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477720/000119312520228462/d855753ds1.htm" target="_blank">S-1 filing</a> that <strong>“Today, 60% of knowledge workers’ time is spent on work about work.”</strong> Most individual contributors trudging through this type of work think it’s just a required part of the job. We’ve spoken with product managers that think there’s no other way - <strong>“you just have to put in the hard work”</strong> is something we’ve heard countless times.</p>

<p>Leadership and Management often fall prey to thinking that toiling work is unavoidable - someone has to do it. Some even shield themselves from touching it - perhaps they had to do it previously, and now have the privilage of delegating the work. However, at the end of the day they need information to make strategic decisions. The process isn’t very resilient for the organizations and doesn’t scale well. It’s a never ending cycle that follows the cadence of quick feedback cycles of agile or frequent touch bases for longer term work.</p>

<p>So, what specificly are teams toiling over? The primary themes we hear are - <a href="#status-updates">Status Updates</a>, <a href="#gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</a>, <a href="#-one-time-use-presentations">One Time Use Presentations</a>, plus <a href="#bonus">a bonus thought</a></p>

<h3 id="status-updates">Status Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Within a team</li>
  <li>Up the management chain</li>
  <li>Across the organization to other teams</li>
  <li>Externally to customers</li>
  <li>Externally partners</li>
  <li>Often locked in 1:1 communication. Knowledge does not diffuse well across an organization.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manifests itself in Emails, Chat messages, 5 minute meetings that actually last 30 minutes or more. Pulling other team members of task to get an answer. Often not visible to the organization as a whole, but is taxing on many team members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cycle time for answers here is generally the shortest and most distracting. You might receive a status request from the client success or sales team trying make a customer happy. Or the data science team on the hunt for when they will be unblocked by data integration. Or finally, a founder or executive trying to close a big contract. It’s hard for team members to be proactive here and they often get caught off guard.</p>

<h5 id="solution">Solution:</h5>
<p>UPS/FedEx style tracking numbers and links that can be proactively shared with stakeholders that automatically pull data from code repositories, other tooling and deployment environment metadata.</p>

<h3 id="gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do we support X across our Web, iOS and Android Offerings</li>
  <li>How do we stack up against competitor Y in features A, B &amp; C.</li>
  <li>Knowledge typically does not diffuse beyond product management org</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally manifests itself in spreadsheets full of project mananagement tool links, red, yellow, green cells and unstructured data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to status updates, these requests often grant a little more heads up, but are often much more tedius, laborious and fraught with outdated information and errors. Can also occur ad-hoc from various parts of your organizations - “does the web app support X?”</p>

<h5 id="solution-1">Solution:</h5>
<p>We think teams should label their code bases against structured feature definitions. Doing so would allow teams to query against capabilities in their portfolio.</p>

<h3 id="one-time-use-presentations">One Time use Presentations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Roadmap presentations &amp; progress against deliverables</li>
  <li>Gap analysis result deep dives</li>
  <li>Sprint review slide shows</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This one depends on the culture of the organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solution-2">Solution:</h5>
<p>Structuring Data for <em>Status Updates</em> and <em>Gap Analysis</em> will help automate the generation of presentations.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<h3 id="creation-and-updating-of-tasks">Creation and Updating of Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>writing up tickets</li>
  <li>updating status updates between tools</li>
  <li>dragging tickets between swim lanes</li>
  <li>pulling tickets into sprints</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="solution-3">Solution:</h5>
<p>We’re working towards a world where you do not purely update a status for work. Your work should update the status for you. Think about this for a minute - what if you just did the hard work and everything else was automated? The documentation, the status updates, the portfolio gap analysis, the organization of it all.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>
<p>The outputs of these manual exercises are impossible to compare or measure over time against one another.</p>

<p>In 2020, teams shouldn’t be toiling away at quickly outdated or disposable Status Updates, Gap Analysis &amp; Building Presentations. Data should flow from existing sources of truth (the code) which can be merged with other metadata to provide evergreen intelligence to organization. We can automate this.</p>

<p>Particularly over the last 10 years, product development culture has become more agile, and in doing so, less tangible, quantifiable or measurable. Yes, we can track conversion rates and usage cohorts and stats like never before, but there’s no objective measure of functionality existing or not. We’re working to fix that so you can have your cake and eat it too. We want you to spend more time taking to customers and diving deep into real problems, not busy work.</p>

<p>We are scratching the surface of what we think is possible, join us for the adventure. We’d love to hear your thoughts on this, join the discussion in the <a href="https://twitter.com/HipSpec/status/1304413947588739072">Twitter thread</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust doesn’t have namespaces in its package management system. It’s often viewed as a bug. But it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! While there are negative aspects of a flat package registry, there are also real benefits. Stability, continuity, and unity (discourages forks and fragmented identity). Proposals that seek to add namespacing without addressing the positive aspects they remove probably won’t be accepted.</p><p>I have noticed the benefits of the current system seem to only get mentioned in passing as objections to proposals and never outlined anywhere. This is an attempt to fix that by summarizing points raised across the various proposals I’ve read. While I don’t represent the crates.io team (I’m not even on the team) I hope to accurately represent trade-offs being considered.</p><h2 id="aspects-of-registry-structure">Aspects of Registry Structure</h2><p>How identity works in package management has far-reaching consequences. Most of the namespace proposals I’ve seen have been motivated by trying to address squatting and/or tweaking the current system of package identity. However, the structure of the crates.io registry affects more than just those areas. But we’ll start with the basics of identity and work from there.</p><h3 id="identity">Identity</h3><p>How do you refer to a package? A crate has at least three identities I can think of:</p><ul><li>The name on crates.io - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The name used in Cargo.toml - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The default name used in code - there is can be more than one per name, which is rare in practice</li><li>The actual name used in code - this can be controlled through Cargo.toml or externs statements, but renaming isn’t required</li></ul><p>The first two are called the <code>package.name</code> in Cargo.toml of the crate being published. The third can be overridden via <code>lib.name</code> in the package being published. The last is user-controlled. Usually, all of these names match, with the caveat that dashes are underscores in code (and crates.io doesn’t allow two crates with identical crates.io names after normalizing dashes to underscores).</p><p>Arguably, self-explanatory identities have a leg up on other identities from a discoverability perspective. E.g. <code>argparse</code> probably seems more reputable at first glance than <code>clap</code> if you’re going of name alone.</p><p>A flat registry makes identity management (naming a crate) harder. You either have to pick a GUID (haha, please don’t) or some memorable (but probably mostly or completely unrelated) identity. I see this as the main driving force for proposals seeking to add namespaces or otherwise address squatting.</p><h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3><p>Currently, identity is continuous - a crate’s identity is immutable and that has real benefits. If you want to change the identity system at all you’ve got to ensure that identities don’t change out from under you. This is a strike against any namespace system that allows namespace ownership to unexpectedly change. Discontinuous identity has a couple of issues.</p><p>First, if a crate’s name can change, that’s bad for users. They have to go figure out the new name of the package if they want to update.</p><p>Second, if an identity’s crate can change (a consequence of the previous point if identities are reusable), then you’ve introduced a security vulnerability. Updating to a new package version with different content under different ownership is a real security risk. Doubly so if you don’t ban new minor versions on the last major version after an unintentional ownership change. Should people audit their crate? Yes! But the fewer foot-guns we have the better.</p><p>In addition to preventing security issues, proposals need to encourage transitions over transactions. Gradual moves over all-or-nothing moves. This could be seen more as compatibility than continuity. This drives things like the rust editions and the need for namespace proposals to be backward compatible.</p><h3 id="stability">Stability</h3><p>A core tenet of Rust is stability. The obvious definition is that things that compile yesterday should compile today (even with a new compiler).</p><p>A less obvious definition is that adding new dependencies shouldn’t stop you from compiling already working code. This is a major motivation for the orphan rule (though the orphan rule is more nuanced than that). This is a strike against schemes that encourage multiple distinct crates to have the same default name in code. I don’t think any proposal that encourages this could be approved. It also suggests that we ought to ban new instances of a crates default code name deviating from its package/Cargo.toml name.</p><p>In addition to code stability, crates.io should be stable too. It should be able to isolate itself from outside services. It currently depends on Github, but it doesn’t have to. This is a strike against any system that weds namespace identity to any externally managed system.</p><h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3><p>The current identity system encourages squatting. I would define squatting as reserving a crate without actually using it. This is a natural outcome in the Rust ecosystem for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Crates are easy to publish, so it’s easy to reserve a crate by publishing an empty crate</li><li>We have de-facto namespaces using prefixes - <code>serde-*</code> is one example.</li><li>There can only ever be one version of a package name. There is only one <code>http</code> crate for example. So package names are a scarce resource.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot of squatting on crates.io. I don’t have any hard numbers though.</p><p>We don’t have any structured support for squatting either, which makes it hard to separate bad actors from good actors. I think separating them out would require manual intervention, and the crates.io team is small and doesn’t have a lot of time to put towards that.</p><p>So what’s a bad actor? I consider someone who squats a bunch of crates to make or point or prevent their names from being used to be a bad actor. Crates.io has a policy against using automation to claim ownership of crates, but I haven’t heard much about it being enforced. Again, time is an issue. And this would probably extend to namespace ownership as well.</p><p>I do think there are legitimate uses. Reserving a set of extension crates for a project you’re working on is one example. My other example is reserving a crate you genuinely intend to work on (this one is a little more debatable).</p><h2 id="it-s-about-the-trade-offs">It’s about the Trade-offs</h2><p>With this system in mind, it’s hard to come up with a namespace proposal that doesn’t hurt the current system in some way.</p><p>I’d say the biggest tension is in code-level identities. They become either overlapping by chopping the namespace portion off or much longer by including the namespace portion. The previous points show why overlapping is generally considered a non-starter. And for longer identities, you need to come up with some new way to reference namespaces in code that’s doesn’t break things.</p><p>More to the point though, from what I’ve seen, most people proposing identity schemes propose it so that the ecosystem can support the overlapping crate identities (e.g. multiple http crates). And that’s exactly what the current system avoids doing.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">an on-point quote from CAD97</a> summing up (hopefully fairly accurately) what namespaces mean to the parties involved:</p><blockquote><p>To the crates team, it seems to <em>primarily</em> mean that a project can put multiple packages together under an umbrella, such that you know the packages are for-sure by the project.</p><p>To the people who feel most slighted by the crates team’s approach here, namespaces <em>primarily</em> mean the ability to publish a crate with a desired name even if there’s already a package published that provides a crate with that name, by putting the package into a different namespace such that the names do not clash.</p><p>If the latter party asks about “namespaces” and means the latter, and the team answers and means the former, you can see where the miscommunication enters, especially since the crates team has now communicated here the position that <em>generally</em>, the <code>package.name == lib.name</code> falsehood should not be made more false; i.e., the latter group’s goal is an explicitly non-desired property from the crates team.</p></blockquote><h2 id="where-to-now">Where to Now?</h2><p>There have been other proposals for namespaces that are less about overlapping identity and more about curation and grouping related crates together. There are multiple proposals there, each with their trade-offs. Expect a follow-up post discussing some of those.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-highlights">Appendix A: Highlights</h2><p>There’s a nice set of a dozen or so comments I save as I reviewed past discussions:</p><p>Carol10Cents (of the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20</a></li></ul><p>kornel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26</a></li></ul><p>sgrif (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7</a></li></ul><p>CAD97:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633</a></li></ul><p>withoutboats (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10</a></li></ul><p>ag_dubs (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28</a></li></ul><p>pietroalbini (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791</a></li></ul><p>Random meeting notes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT</a></li></ul><h2 id="appendix-b-previous-discussions">Appendix B: Previous Discussions</h2><p>There have been several attempts at this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320</a> (This was mine from last year after reading through the other proposals; my …</li></ul></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>Long time no see!
This time I would like to write about a library I was working about a couple years ago,
a serializers library in Ruby.
I have actually finished it about a year ago and I always wanted to create this blog post
but last year has been super busy for me so never got the chance to present it properly :)</p>



<p>But first I would like to talk about serializers in Ruby from a historical perspective :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2013-2014</h3>

<p>Back in 2014, when I started working with APIs, go-to library for serializing Ruby
classes was <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">ActiveModelSerializers</a>, the newly published 0.9.x version.
Back then, with this awesome library we were building basic GraphQL-like structures, before
GraphQL was even announced! It was a joy working with a such powerful tool
where the client could specify which fields it needs from a specific resource but also
which relations.
You could inject exactly what you needed when you were actually rendering the serializer
which meant that you could take a union of client’s desired fields/associations,
the default fields/associations (if client’s input was empty), and what client was allowed to access.
The result was a super flexible API.</p>

<p>Apart from AMS, there was <a href="https://github.com/ismasan/oat">Oat</a> a pretty nice little library which supported
out of the box <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> and <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a> which for some
reason felt like Godzilla to me at that point, but to be honest it’s a completely proper way of
building hypermedia APIs in Ruby since you can do a lot of cool stuff with caching.
However the catch is that you can’t create reusable adapters, basically it’s like
Rails views, everything needs to be implemented from scratch.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2015-2016</h3>

<p>Going forward, in 2015, the AMS rewrite had already begun since 2014 for the
0.10.x version. For various reasons, in the company I was working at that time, it was decided
to go with the 0.10.x and of course we completely regretted it. At that point it was 0.10.RC4 that we
were using, just 1 RC release before the 0.10.0. Now you can tell me, “of course
what do you expect? You were using an RC version” and you might be right. Only that the frustration
didn’t come from things that weren’t polished 100%.
I would be fine with that and I was eager to help out.
The frustration came from the fact that the architecture was a completely different beast
from 0.9 and 0.8 versions, everything were different, code and (the sparse) documentation.
And I am saying this because I <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=author%3Avasilakisfil">did try</a> to help out sending pull requests, and the more
I was working with the code, the more frustrated I got.</p>

<p>Here are some things that come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>both 0.8/0.9 and 0.10.x are using the same repo, although they share completely different
API/code, making things extremely confusing from a API developer perspective, but also
very difficult to manage as well from a contributor’s perspective</li>
<li>super complex overall architecture</li>
<li>the gem made JSON:API as first citizen. That’s inflexible to build adapters for different
specs and has affected pretty much everything in the code.
The previous versions were using the AMS API style (mostly json with some very basic patterns). 0.10.x version
also supported that style but the code for that was like a completely different
branch inside the code (not sure if it’s still like that but I guess it is).
I understand that JSON:API is a quite popular spec, but tight the whole generic library to that
spec is a bad design, I think.</li>
<li>too many dependencies (requires ActiveSupport..)</li>
<li>tightly coupled to ActiveRecord (at least at that time, not sure if now has changed..)</li>
<li>caching was implemented in the same library. I really thing that’s a completely different concern..</li>
<li>some parts did not match the Ruby coding style (like include: ‘a,string,of,resources’, default_includes ‘**’)</li>
<li>maintainers were reluctant to merge pull requests, because even in the Github issues was an extreme
confusion of what’s implemented, what’s missing, what bugs exists etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In one word <strong>it was a failure</strong>. Like, imagine the most popular Serializers gem in Ruby,
Rails team <a href="https://medium.com/@joaomdmoura/the-future-of-ams-e5f9047ca7e9">was pushing them</a> to finish in-time before the release of Rails 5 so they can include
it in the same release (although completely different gem, I guess they would make a note about it),
maintainers were struggling to make this happen and of course it didn’t.</p>

<p>Now I should also pause a bit and say that <strong>I have nothing against the commiters/maintainers</strong>.
They definitely <strong>did their best, and the problem wasn’t lying there</strong>.
It’s just that sometimes Open Source projects fail.
And in my experience they fail, when there isn’t a very tight core team that has the same vision,
coding style and are gatekeepers in pull requests, until the library has proved itself.
Then, any new pull request will probably respect the existing code and won’t challenge it.
Merging code will be much easier, at that point.</p>

<p>Instead with AMS, <strong>different people started the rework, different people took over
and did their best to finish it</strong>, and for the whole time, various people were sending pull
requests for various features and bugs, of course to help out, but what happened
was a very complex architecture with no clear design and vision.
Actually it would be a great idea to take some interviews by the project contributors at that time.
I think they will have some insights to contribute regarding to what happened :)</p>

<p>During my frustration with AMS I always wondered: how difficult can it be to
build a feature-complete Ruby Serializers ? Well, it turned out to be a bit more complex
than I initially thought. <strong>Way more complex</strong> :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in  2017-2018</h3>

<p>I guess I wasn’t the one who was a bit frustrated with AMS.
<a href="https://github.com/beauby">beauby</a>, an AMS core member went off and created a JSON:API specific serializers gem,
the <a href="https://github.com/jsonapi-rb">jsonapi-rb</a>.
It follows spec pretty well and should be fine using it.
It’s also dependency free.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a year later (2018) Netflix came over and published <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">their own
JSON:API serializers gem</a> which is extremely fast to be honest.
Like <strong>SUPER FAST</strong>.
Unfortunately it requires ActiveSupport as a dependency (not sure why, earlier releases didn’t)
and that could be a bummer for some applications.
Also it might not be as flexible as AMS or jsonapi-rb (although latest releases have
closed the gap A LOT), but in my experience it’s flexible enough that you will
almost never need to look for something else.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers today</h3>

<p>Today, if someone asked me which Serializers gem should I use, I would tell him/her
go for the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a> gem. It’s super fast, it supports a quite popular API
spec and you must have a really good reason to not use it.</p>

<p>Personally, <strong>I am a bit against of having links inside the response</strong>, treating the
client as plain stupid. That’s one of the reasons why I don’t like JSON:API.
I think it’s just too verbose.
(The other reason is the naming: they picked up the 2 most popular words regarding APIs,
<em>JSON</em> and <em>API</em>, glued them together and made the name, feels so much cheating..)
I like to load off some work to the client using introspective
methods. I have talked <a href="https://introspected.rest/">about it</a> some time ago.
But if anyone came and asked me what I would suggest for a brand new API, my
answer would be pretty straightforward: <strong>JSON:API, unless you have good reasons
not to</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s the more experienced API designers that might want to implement something more
versatile and more advanced, tailored to a specific use case.
Or might want to experiment a bit.
For instance, another cool API spec that’s in the same philosophy as JSON:API is
<a href="https://ionspec.org/">Ion</a>.
Not as popular as JSON:API but worth checking it out!
Problem is that when you need to implement something different from JSON:API,
in Ruby you don’t really have much options. Well you have, it’s AMS but it will
be pain in the ass to create a custom serializer from that one.
And it will be painstakingly slow.
And you can’t have more advanced concepts, like forms, relations on collections
etc.
Or you could use <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a>, but the problem with jbuilder is that it can’t
have the notion of adapters, hence you always need to build the final result
from scratch. Not fun.</p>

<h3>SimpleAMS: Modern Ruby Serializers</h3>

<p>When I started working on the prototype of SimpleAMS, I set a couple of goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted the library to be super simple, easy to use with injectable API and clean code.
Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/varvet/pundit">pundit</a>? I want a pundit for serializing.</li>
<li>One of the things that I sometimes don’t like in Ruby coding style, is the level of assumptions that the
code makes on behalf of you.
It had been a quite common pattern in Ruby/Rails that lead to many confusion of what
exactly the API is while at the same time such patterns reduce the flexibility.
The code is trying to act smart, but the drawbacks of such smartness overweight the gains.
I feel some basic assumptions which can be overridden at anytime is the ideal.
Embracing clean, explicit code is what I want, so that you can understand what’s happening instantly.</li>
<li>I wanted to create a generic abstraction as a first class citizen. From there
you should be able to implement any serializer needed, but that abstraction should be
powerful enough to cover even the most extreme corner cases.
After all, it’s tough to beat <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a>, that’s shouldn’t be my goal ;)</li>
<li>I wanted super clean code, no smarty complex meta thingies inside the code.
I also wanted expected behavior on the internals and how it works when someone
started looking in the codebase.
Of course except the <a href="https://github.com/vasilakisfil/SimpleAMS/blob/master/lib/simple_ams/dsl.rb">DSL part</a>, which uses some advanced Ruby metaprogramming concepts,
but that’s necessary if we want it to work with just an <code>include</code>.</li>
<li>Much faster than AMS, it’s well known that AMS is quite slow so that should be easy :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The API</h3>

<p>Before starting on any new project, I like to put my imagination and come up
with a useful API and use cases.
Being in god mode, and leaving all the constraints on the side, you can come up with
some really cool APIs.</p>

<h4>DSL based API</h4>

<p>So how would you use a serializers library in Ruby?
I want to avoid any inheritance in order to use SimpleAMS,
because …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>

<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>8</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m always a little suspicious of job specs looking for the so-called <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role. They often mention a vast variety of duties and responsibilities. </p>



<blockquote><p>Are they hiring for a single role or a whole team?</p></blockquote>



<p>Roles having <em>DevOps</em> in their title hardly share the same meaning. They often have something in common, though. They try to cover for what traditionally would have been the specialization of different professionals.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong: cross-functional expertise is definitely important. But I don’t think <em>DevOps</em> means replacing a multitude of specialization with a single role. Different specializations like Operations, Security, Testing, Development, Product Management and so on, are vast and require specific knowledge. </p>



<p>I think the key differentiator of successful <em>DevOps</em> organizations is that they enable effective collaboration. They have as clear <em>North Star</em> the goal to deliver value to the end user.</p>



<p>Overall, I don’t think we should be talking about a <em>DevOps Engineer</em>, but rather about <em>DevOps</em> culture in organizations.</p>



<p>But let’s take a step back first.</p>



<h2>What does DevOps mean, really?</h2>



<p>I tweeted my own definition of DevOps some time ago.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DevOps is a highly condensed way of referring to the combination of practices that aim at shortening the software development life-cycle, increase the feedback opportunities and facilitate continuous improvement and experimentation.</p>— Alessandro Diaferia (@alediaferia) <a href="https://twitter.com/alediaferia/status/1279460637341560833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><em>DevOps</em> organizations incentivise different specialities to collaborate. The intrinsic existing tension between Dev, making changes to the system, and Ops, wanting to keep the system stable, dissolves. The greater good is now <em>the value stream</em>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A stable system that delivers nothing is as useless as an unstable system that keeps offering new functionality.</p></blockquote>



<p>Dev and Ops understand the importance of working together to maximise this flow to figure out which bets worked out and which ones didn’t. </p>



<p>Organizations that embrace the <em>DevOps</em> mindset can be more effective than the competition at experimenting with new functionality. They quickly validate their assumptions, activating and deactivating functionality by flipping a switch on a dashboard.</p>



<p>Incidents become an opportunity for learning rather than a chance of blaming someone.</p>



<p>In general, <em>DevOps </em>organization learn to adapt and evolve to any situation.</p>



<p>Overall, I think there shouldn’t be a single <em>DevOps</em> role but, rather, a set of specific specialities collaborating effectively.</p>



<p>This ideal view of the terminology, though, might sometimes clash with the reality of the job market. Companies willing to attract the best talent with the most current skills may end up advertising for roles that are counterproductive in the context of DevOps principles.</p>



<p>But let’s have a look at a few interesting job specs.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="432" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-768x432.jpg" alt="work harder neon sign photo" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jordan-whitfield-sm3Ub_IJKQg-unsplash-2048x1151.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@whitfieldjordan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jordan Whitfield</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/job-search?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>What are companies looking for?</h2>



<p>Let’s read through a few excerpts from job specs I found out there in the wild.</p>



<h3>The flexible problem solver</h3>



<blockquote><p>[…] Devops Engineers are IT professionals who collaborate with software developers, system operators and other IT staff members to manage code releases. They cross and merge the barriers that exist between software development, testing and operations teams and keep existing networks in mind as they design, plan and test. Responsible for multitasking and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time, Devops Engineers must be extremely flexible. […]</p><cite>A job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is one of those classic examples where the organization believes that the DevOps principles should be delegated to a single team.</p>



<p>The spec mentions the myriad of duties that are responsibility of the <em>Devops Engineers</em> in the company. A <em>Devops Engineer</em> is expected to <em>“multi-task and deal with multiple urgent situations at a time”</em>. Therefore, they <em>“must be extremely flexible”</em>.</p>



<p><em>Multitasking</em> and dealing with multiple urgent situations at a time is, for sure, likely to happen anywhere: I don’t think this should be a peculiarity of a role in an organization. On the contrary, a healthy environment empowers every engineer to handle urgent situations and <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">learn from them</a>.<mark id="annotation-text-54d7a912-f939-4d9c-8c35-b5876683f83c"></mark></p>



<hr>



<p>Coming across this role, I’d think that the organization is not really trying to adopt DevOps practices. <mark id="annotation-text-9ee4ee73-52fa-44d6-b856-3c9ba17dd0f4"></mark>Instead of encouraging people to collaborate and improve, they’re building a dedicated team to throw issues and urgent situations at.</p>



<p><mark id="annotation-text-d4681dd9-2adf-49b8-b88c-e4c6a256a1e7"></mark> This job spec would be a big red flag for me.</p>



<h3>The productivity booster</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer combines an understanding of both engineering and coding. A DevOps Engineer works with various departments to create and develop systems within a company. From creating and implementing software systems to analysing data to improve existing ones, a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace.</p><cite>Another job spec on the internet</cite></blockquote>



<p>In a <em>DevOps</em> organization engineers <em>do</em> work with various departments. But what’s the point then of  having a dedicated <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role? Do the other type of engineers not work with the various departments of the organization? Do non-DevOps Engineers not analyse data and improve existing systems? Additionally, the job spec claims that <em>a DevOps Engineer increases productivity in the workplace</em>. How? Does it radiate productivity?</p>


	
	


<h3>The Release Manager… but <em>DevOps</em>!</h3>



<blockquote><p>A DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. […] Ultimately, you will execute and automate operational processes fast, accurately and securely.</p><cite>My favourite so far</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is quite a condensed one but the release aspect mentioned in it strikes me as particularly interesting.</p>



<p>I tend to separate the concept of <em>deployment</em> from the one of <em>release</em>. Users experience product updates governed by a release policy that may or may not be the same as the deployment policy. This really depends on the strategy of the organization.</p>



<p>Regardless of this distinction, though, I believe that constraining the capability of delivering value to the end user to a specific role undermines the agility of an organization.</p>



<p>The teams should be able to continuously release code into production. Mechanisms such as <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flags</a></em> should control the release of functionality. This means that the code in production doesn’t necessarily activate upon deploying it, making it possible for the organization to control when the functionality actually reaches the user.</p>



<p>In general, a deployment should be a non-event: nothing special, just another merge into the main branch that causes code to end up in production.</p>



<p>In a fast-paced world like the one we live in an organization shouldn’t constrain itself by requiring dedicated engineers to release new functionality. Modern environments require companies to always be experimenting. Organizations should empower non-technical teams to run experiments, analyse data and autonomously decide when to <em>release</em> new functionality. All of this, ideally, shouldn’t require <em>ad hoc</em> intervention from a specific engineer.</p>



<p>Job specs like this one feel like they’re trying to repurpose the role of the <em>Release Manager</em> to keep up with the latest trends by just changing a few words.</p>



<p>I don’t think release management goes away in a <em>DevOps</em> organization. Rather, the <em>Release Management</em> becomes ensuring that the rest of the organization can be autonomous at releasing. Achieving this means investing in automation and internal tools for the whole company.</p>



<h3>A Platform Engineer. But <em>cooler!</em></h3>



<blockquote><p>The DevOps Engineer will be a key leader in shaping processes and tools that enable cross-functional collaboration and drive CI/CD transformation. The DevOps Engineer will work closely with product owners, developers, and external development teams to build and configure a high performing, scalable, cloud-based platform that can be leveraged by other product teams.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is the <em>least bad</em> of the job specs I’ve encountered. It describes a set of responsibilities that usually pertain to a Platform or Infrastructure Team. Most of these teams often get renamed to DevOps Team and their members become DevOps Engineers for <em>fashion</em> reasons.</p>



<p>The Platform Engineering team is the key enabler for organizations that want to embrace the DevOps principles. But thinking that they only pertain to a specific team will hardly result in a successful journey.</p>



<p>This team will surely be responsible to build the relevant infrastructure that enables the other teams to build on top but they can’t be left alone in the understanding and application of those principles.</p>



<p>Developer teams will need to become autonomous at adopting and making changes to those systems; they will need to understand the implications of their code running in production; understand how to recognize if the system is not behaving as expected and be able to action to restore it.</p>



<p>Equally, the Product team should spend time understanding what new important capabilities derive from adopting DevOps practices. Code continuously flowing into production behind feature flags, containerization technologies, improved monitoring and alerting, <em>et cetera</em>, open endless opportunities.</p>



<p>Improved user experience and experimentation opportunities, for example, are an important asset to leverage to remain competitive.</p>

<h2>What should companies be looking for?</h2>



<p>We’ve just gone through a few job specs that look for variations of a <em>DevOps Engineer</em> role and I’ve outlined what aspects I think are flawed in those roles. But what should companies look for, then?</p>



<p>Before blindly starting to hire for roles driven by industry fashion trends, organizations should rather invest in understanding what’s holding them back from being <em>DevOps</em>.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/">Unicorn Project</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim">Gene Kim</a> mentions the <em>Five Ideals</em> of successful DevOps organizations.

			<p>These days your primary means of listening to music if likely from an app on your phone. So how do you get the music from your phone to your laptop or desktop that has better speakers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use Bluetooth and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a>. PulseAudio is the modern sound implementation on the Linux desktop. It runs as a sound server and takes sound inputs such a microphone or your browser playing a YouTube video and directs this sound to outputs such as your Laptop’s speakers.</p>
<p>PulseAudio can take the audio from a Bluetooth connection and route it to your laptop’s speakers and is very simple to get running.</p>
<p>First, install the PulseAudio Bluetooth modules. On ArchLinux this is called <code>pulseaudio-bluetooth</code> and on Ubuntu/Debian it is called <code>pulseaudio-module-bluetooth</code>.</p>
<p>After you have installed this package open the following file:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/pulse/system.pa
</code></pre><p>And add the following couple of lines:</p>
<pre><code>load-module module-bluetooth-policy
load-module module-bluetooth-discover
</code></pre><p>Then, as your regular user, restart PulseAudio:</p>
<pre><code>$ pulseaudio -k
$ pulseaudio --start
</code></pre><p>And you’re all set!</p>
<p>All you need to do is to pair your phone and your computer and start playing something on your phone and it will play through your computer’s speakers.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
		<p>Checked exceptions have always been a controversial feature of the Java language.</p>
<p>Advocates claim they ensure checking &amp; recovery from failures. Detractors say “catch” blocks can almost never recover from an exception, and are a frequent source of mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Java 8 and lambdas are here. Are checked exceptions becoming obsolete in the Java world?<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<h3>The Intent of Checked Exceptions</h3>
<p>In the mid 90’s, James Gosling at Sun came up with a new language.</p>
<p>At the time, C++ programming required every single function return to be checked for error. He decided there had to be a better way, and built the concept of “exceptions” into Java.</p>
<p>The intent of <strong>checked exceptions</strong> was to locally flag, and force developers to handle, possible exceptions. Checked exceptions have to be declared on a method signature, or handled.</p>
<p>This was intended to encourage software reliability &amp; resilience. There was an intent to “recover” from contingencies – predictable outcomes other than success, such as InsufficientFundsException on attempting a payment. There was less clarity, as to what “recovery” actually entailed.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime exceptions</strong>&nbsp;were also included in Java. Since null pointers, data errors, and illegal states/ accesses could occur anywhere in code, these were made subtypes of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions can be thrown anywhere, without requiring to be declared, and are much more convenient. But would it be correct to use them instead?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The crucial point here, is that runtime &amp; checked exceptions are functionally equivalent.&nbsp;There is no handling or recovery which checked exceptions can do, that runtime exceptions can’t.</p>
<p>The biggest argument against “checked” exceptions is that most exceptions can’t be fixed. The simple fact is, <strong>we don’t own the code/ subsystem that broke.&nbsp;</strong>We can’t see the implementation, we’re not responsible for it, and can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Particularly problematic were the areas of JDBC (SQLException) and RMI for EJB (RemoteException). Rather than identifying fixable contingencies as per the original “checked exception” concept, these forced pervasive systemic reliability issues, not actually fixable, to be widely declared.</p>
<p>For any method, the possibility of failure includes all sub-methods called by it. Potential failures accumulate up the call tree. Declaring these on method signatures no longer offers a specific &amp; local highlight for the developer to watch for – declared exceptions spread throughout the call tree.</p>
<p>Most EJB developers have experienced this – declared exceptions become&nbsp;required on methods through the tier,&nbsp;or entire codebase. Calling a method with different&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;requires dozens of methods to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Many developers were told to catch low-level exceptions, and rethrow them again as higher (application-level) checked exceptions. This required vast numbers – 2000 per project, upwards – of non-functional “catch-throw” blocks.</p>
<p>Swallowing exceptions, concealing the cause, double logging, and returning ‘null’/ uninitialized data all became common. Most projects could count 600+ mis-coded or outright errors.</p>
<p>Eventually, developers rebelled against the vast numbers of “catch” blocks, and the source of error these had become.</p>
<h3>Checked Exceptions – incompatible with Functional Coding</h3>
<p>And then we get to Java 8, with its new <i><b>functional programming&nbsp;</b></i>features – such as lambdas, Streams, and function composition.</p>
<p>These features are built on generics – parameter &amp; return types are genericized, so that iteration &amp; stream operations ( <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>) can be written which perform a common operation, regardless of item type.</p>
<p>Unlike data types, however, declared exceptions can’t be genericized.</p>
<p>There is no possibility in Java to provide a stream operation (like, for example, &nbsp;<code>Stream.map</code>) which takes a lambda declaring some checked exception, &amp; transparently passes that same checked exception to surrounding code.</p>
<p>This has always been a major points against checked exceptions – all intervening code, between a throw and the receiving “catch” block, is forced to be aware of exceptions.</p>
<p>The workaround, of “wrapping” it in a RuntimeException, conceals the original type of the exception – rendering the exception-specific “catch” blocks envisaged in the original concept useless.</p>
<p>Finally we can capture Java’s new philosophy in a nutshell, by noting that none of the new “functional interfaces” in Java 8 declare checked exceptions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exceptions in Java provided major benefits in reliability &amp; error-handling over earlier languages.&nbsp;Java enabled reliable server &amp; business software, in a way C/ C++ never could.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions were,&nbsp;in their original form, an attempt&nbsp;to handle&nbsp;<i>contingencies</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>failures</i>.&nbsp;The laudable goal was to highlight specific predictable points (unable to connect,&nbsp;file not found,&nbsp;etc) &amp; ensure developers handled these.</p>
<p>What was never included in the original concept, was to force a vast range of systemic &amp;&nbsp;unrecoverable failures to be declared. These <em>failures</em>&nbsp;were never correct to be&nbsp;declared as checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Failures are generally possible in code, and EJB, web &amp; Swing/AWT containers already cater for this by providing an outermost “failed request” exception-handler. The most basic correct strategy is to rollback the transaction &amp; return an error.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions allow any exception-handling possible with checked exceptions, but avoid restrictive coding restraints. This simplifies coding &amp; makes it easier to follow best practice of&nbsp;<a href="http://wikijava.org/wiki/10_best_practices_with_Exceptions#Throw_early_catch_late" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wikijava.org']);">throw early, catch late</a>&nbsp;where exceptions are handled at the outermost/ highest possible level.</p>
<p>Leading Java frameworks and influences have now definitively moved&nbsp;away from checked exceptions. Spring, Hibernate and modern Java frameworks/&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;use only runtime exceptions, and this convenience is a major factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>Personalities such Josh Bloch (Java&nbsp;Collections framework), Rod Johnson, Anders Hejlsberg (father of&nbsp;C#), Gavin King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn&nbsp;(JodaTime)&nbsp;have all come out against checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, in&nbsp;Java 8,&nbsp;lambdas are&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental step forward.&nbsp;These language features&nbsp;abstract the “flow of control” from functional operations within. As we’ve seen, this makes checked exceptions &amp; the requirement to “declare or handle immediately” obsolete.</p>
<p>For developers, it is always important to pay attention to reliability &amp; diagnose likely points of failure (contingencies) such as file open, database connection, etc. If we provide good error messages at this points, we will have&nbsp;created&nbsp;self-diagnosing software – a pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
<p>But we should do this with unchecked exceptions, and if we have to rethrow, should always use RuntimeException or an app-specific subclass.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn says, if your projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;still using or advocating checked exceptions, your skills are 5-10 years out date.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. The doc recommended I up the dosage, but I could see this would eventually lead me to a straitjacket.</p>



<p>Over the years I’ve tried different meds, various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as clinical depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and covid anxiety. My longest bouts of depression now last a day at most and even that doesn’t happen too often.</p>



<p>You can try it too: <a href="https://beta.wuju.app/">beta.wuju.app</a></p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-11</p>
        
<p>I'm always a bit flabbergasted when I see how people test their code (especially with unit tests). Often I can't figure out a cohesive set of rules based on which the tests are written.</p>
<p>Testing seems to work from a pragmatic perspective, we have evidence it works, but different people define "testing" in different ways. I'm awfully afraid that what some people refer to as "testing" is completely unrelated to that unrigorous but pragmatic practice that saves us from production bugs.</p>
<h2>I - A contrived example</h2>
<p>To showcase my arbitrary formalism as it relates to testing, I think it's worthwhile to look at some cases:</p>
<h4>1)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing a multiplication function
func multiply(int a, int b) -&gt; int

func test_1():
  assert 2*5 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 10*12 == multiply(12,10)

func test_2():
  assert 10 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 120 == multiply(12,10)

func test_3():
  assert type(multiply(2,5)) == int
  assert type(multiply) == func(int,int)-&gt;int
</code></pre>
<h4>2)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing an image classification algorithm
func classify(arr[int] image) -&gt; str

func test_1():
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('cat.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('dog.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_2():
  assert 'cat' == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert 'dog' == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_3():
  possible_targets = ['cat','cheta','tiger','dog','wolf','coyote','other']
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_1.jpg')) in possible_targets
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_2.jpg')) in possible_targets
</code></pre>
<p>For both examples, <code>test_1</code> obviously makes no sense. You're testing the functionality of a function using another function that does the same thing. If the function used to assert correct functionality is better (i.e. if <code>*</code> is better than <code>multiply</code> or <code>img_classification_nn</code> is better than <code>classify</code>), than one should simply use that function instead. If they are equally flawed, then the tests are redundant.</p>
<p>These kinds of tests are a theatrical performance to build up an illusion of quality. Usually spotted in enterprise-grade codebases and teams that harp on about TDD a lot, I'll classify these as <strong>redundant checks</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, <code>test_2</code> is more interesting, it's comparing the result of a function with what a human would expect the result of that function to be. Here I would argue the test makes sense for the <code>classify</code> function but not for the <code>multiply</code> function.</p>
<p>Computers are good at multiplying, humans are horrible at it. So testing this function against an arbitrary number of human answers is much more likely to reveal flaws with the human's answer rather than the computer's. Since the function is very simple, time would probably better spent reviewing the actual code to make sure it's error-free.</p>
<p>On the other hand, computers aren't very good at classifying images (though they are getting there), but humans are spot on. So using a human's answers to validate a vision algorithm makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>We'll call these types of tests <strong>human validations</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we get to <code>test_3</code>, which superficially seems less flawed than the other two. It's more of a sanity check than a test, we aren't checking the actual return value of the function in a given case, we are instead checking a higher-level behavior.</p>
<p>These tests are much more common in the codebases of dynamic languages, and for good reason. In our first example, we are just validating the signature of a function, something a compiler will implicitly do for us in any statically typed language.</p>
<p>In the second example, we are instead working around a limitation of our type system. We are checking if the result of our function (a string) is contained within 7 different values (the possible things our function should classify images as), which we could test implicitly by using a language that supports <code>enum</code> types and writing <code>classify</code> such that it returns an enum of those 7 classes.</p>
<p>Basically, these kinds of tests can be useful, but they are the kind of things a compiler can handle automatically when they are present they usually indicate a mistake in the language the programmer is using for the project. We'll call these <strong>compiler rules</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Obviously, this system is fairly arbitrary, it's just a conclusion I reached after looking at various codebases and talking with various people about their tests, but I find that it works quite well.</p>
<p>To re-iterate, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>redundant checks</li>
<li>human validation</li>
<li>compiler rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>II - Compiler rules</h2>
<p>Compiler rules are great, but it's a bad sign when they leak into your testing.</p>
<p>Some amount of compiler rules leaking into testing can't be helped. Until the advent of Rust and/or well-performing libraries for safe multi-threading, testing thread safety should have been a requirement in many codebases. Similarly, before modern type system and allocation techniques, one ought to assume various now-pointless memory checks might have fared well within a codebase (and, I assume, still do on some embedded devices).</p>
<p>Even more, switching to more modern languages and compilers is often a task much harder than just writing some tests, but I think these tests should be viewed as a cautionary sign against the language currently used. If they only cover a small but critical percentage of the codebase, everything is fine, if they cover most of it, it's an indicator of using the wrong compile-time tooling.</p>
<p>The one difficult thing about these tests might be spotting them, an inexperienced team might be writing loads of these tests without realizing there are better alternatives to the compile-time toolchain they are using which would replace the need for them.</p>
<h2>III - Redundant checks</h2>
<p>Redundant checks are often pointless busywork, but they can serve a valuable role in some cases.</p>
<p>The two main scenarios that come to mind are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one well-proven and one "experimental", where the "experimental" function has some benefits in terms of performance or generalizability, it seems reasonable to test the "experimental" function using the well-proven approach. Still, the overhead here is so severe I find it difficult to think of a real-world example where this applies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one in a "new" codebase and one an "old" codebase, it makes sense to test the "new" version with the "old" version. In this sense, going back to compiler rules, redundant checks can be useful in the process of refactoring, especially for major changes like changing the language or the core framework upon which the project is built. However, this seems useful only as a "temporary" measure rather than a permanent fixture of a project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I'd wager that most tests falling in this category, as mentioned before, are there only as "filler" and indicative of a much bigger underlying problem of a team that engages in busywork. If I ever accepted such a test, I would require plenty of complimentary comments to explain why they exist and when they can be removed.</p>
<h2>IV - Human validation</h2>
<p>Human validation is the "sanest" type of testing one can perform, it can be replaced by good practices or good languages. The problem with human validation comes from the fact that in some cases human intelligence can't solve the problems the software is designed to solve or can't cover all the edge cases the software will encounter.</p>
<p>Take for example banking software. It's fairly easy to imagine what should happen with a piece of banking software that provided dozens of customers, hundreds of transactions, and a few regulatory restrictions. All the logic there can be written down into tests that validate our software. However, the software itself must scale to millions of customers, trillions of transactions, and thousands of regulatory restrictions. Something a human mind can't comprehend coherently in order to write the tests.</p>
<p>Still, banking software is an easy example, because the various components might be test-able and their limited logic might be fully comprehensible by a human, even accounting for all the edge cases. This is because the inputs to the software are very well defined, there are only so many things one can do with a banking API, a finite space which a human mind can explore exhaustively when properly broken down.</p>
<p>One real problem arises when we have software with a very broad and/or poorly define input and/or outputs spaces. A few examples of these would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrappers that distill information from a broad range of websites (e.g. the ones used by a search engine)</li>
<li>Machine learning algorithms meant to work on a broad range of data (e.g. a decision tree or a gradient boosting classifier implementation in a library like sklearn)</li>
<li>Any software that has to work well with user-provided code extensions (e.g. think a video game-like Skyrim that has to support mods)</li>
<li>Simulation software (e.g. physics simulations)</li>
<li>Creative software (e.g. multimedia editing &amp; creation, game engines)</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
</ul>
<p>One can separate these into components with input-output spaces that can be easily comprehended by the human mind, but some components that suffer from the above problems are bound to remain. It also introduces the problem of writing code separation in such a way that components can be easily tested, rather than with refactoring, extension, speed, or readability as the main concern.</p>
<h2>V - Human validation and cost</h2>
<p>Assuming that we've designed our software such that it has many human-comprehensible components, the issue of cost remains. Human-comprehensible is a vague term, there are many things which, given enough time, a person could write exhaustive tests for, but in practice, this often takes more time than we can allocate. Furthermore, in certain situations, even in the limited input&amp;output space scenario, it might still be easier to write the "generative" logic (the one that maps inputs to outputs) than to come up with mappings ourselves.</p>
<p>In certain cases, exhaustive validation can be done, but it can be …</p></div></div>

I wanted to share our story, how we turned it around when things were not looking good, and tactical tips for any founders raising money during COVID-19.<br></p><p>Keep in mind all startups are different, and all fundraises are different.

Freshpaint collects behavioral customer data from your website and app, and sends that data to hundreds of analytics and marketing tools in one click.<br></p><p>If you’ve ever been in a situation where you had a difficult time getting engineering bandwidth to instrument something and set up a new tool, or you forgot to track something and didn’t have data for it – Freshpaint solves that.<br></p><p>Software and ecommerce companies use Freshpaint to build a single view of their customer, understand the behaviors of their users, and drive long-term customer value with personalization and relevancy. All without massive engineering overhead.</p><h2>Timeline: A Rocky Start</h2><p>Our timing was impeccable 😐.<br></p><p><strong>March 2, 2020:</strong> We kick off the fundraise. This was a Monday.<br></p><p><strong>March 6, 2020:</strong> Closed our first check. Multiple investors closed this day. This was a Friday.<br></p><p><strong>March 6, 2020:</strong> YC announces that Demo Day will now be 100% virtual.

The market dropped about 15% in March alone.<br></p><p><strong>March 31, 2020:</strong> We raised about $600k so far. The US has the highest number of confirmed cases (178k) of any country in the world.<br></p><p><strong>April 1 to 30:</strong> Momentum comes to a halt. We burn through nearly 100 investor leads, and <em>only raise about $60k in one month</em>. Our win rate during this period was something like 3%. Yikes.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Flattening the curve - our (lack of) progress over time</h2><figure id="w-node-c1dc737aefca-c7024621"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/5f448dc13c1a293b4158e671_5f3b0afdbc25aa2e648c6a5d_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-17%20at%203.55.33%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br>Money raised over time, and the severe impact of COVID-19 on our fundraising progress in April.</figcaption></figure><p>We quickly filled out over ⅓ of our round within a week or so. With our fat pipeline and success at that point, we actually thought we’d have the round closed in another 1-2 weeks.<br></p><div><p>You can see from the timeline above that March was a pretty wild month. The pandemic was rapidly accelerating around the world, things with YC’s Demo Day were shifting day-to-day, and we were busy closing checks.</p><p>‍<strong>And then momentum halted.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong></p><p>April was pretty difficult for us. <strong>During the entire month of April we closed only $60k.</strong> We had multiple conversations debating if we should stop, and if the money we had already closed was enough.</p></div><p>Why did momentum stop? Many institutional investors were busy triaging their current portfolio companies to save those at risk of going out of business due to COVID-19. Nobody was doing diligence on new opportunities. Additionally, there was a general atmosphere of “shit is crazy right now, I’m just gonna wait a few weeks until things settle.”</p><h2>Turning it around</h2><p>There were two specific things we did to help turn things around.<br></p><h5><strong>1. Targeting angels</strong></h5><p>The first was refocusing on angels only. In April we had a very difficult time closing institutional investors (funds). But we still had a high win rate with angels. So we leaned into what was working, and re-filled our pipeline with angels (with a preference for angels that could write large checks).<br></p><h5><strong>2. Weekly investor updates</strong></h5><p>The second thing was we started sending weekly updates to our investors at the end of April. Though a bit aggressive, we committed to weekly updates to keep Freshpaint top of everyone’s minds for the next couple months. Our first update went out on April 18, and then weekly thereafter. Our investors mobilized, and started intro-ing us to more investors in their networks that fit our more targeted criteria.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Momentum picked back up, and we were able to turn things around in May. After closing just $60k in April, we closed about $600k in May. By June fundraising was no longer a priority, but an opportunistic activity. We had already raised our target amount. Due to the momentum, we were even able to bring in some more seed funds. We thought we only needed $1M, but there were so many investors that understood the problem from experience, that we ended up 50% oversubscribed.</p><h2>Our seed round by the numbers</h2><p>In total we pitched over <strong>160 investors</strong>.<br></p><p><strong>We raised 99.5% virtually</strong>. We only met one investor in person (our first meeting). Pre-COVID this would be extremely rare.

They did not respond.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Some Learnings</h2><figure id="w-node-37ba44486bae-c7024621"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/5f3b0a0cc95ca033b5715bb2_image.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A mapping of where our investor checks came from.<br>Circle = angels, Square = VCs.<br>Blue = leads from our network, Red = inbound leads, Black = warm intros or Demo Day leads.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Your job is to find the believers, not to convince the non-believers</strong></h4><p>Some investors spent a lot of time with us because they liked our backgrounds and knew Freshpaint was solving a big problem in a big market. But ultimately they realized they didn’t really understand the space, our approach, or some other reason. They were interested because they felt like they needed to be, not interested because they were <em>actually</em> interested.<br></p><p>But others….man, sometimes an investor would commit after 15 mins on a call. Usually these people had felt a ton of pain around the problem we’re solving, and recognized our approach as something that would have solved their problem.<br></p><h4><strong>Intros, intros, intros</strong></h4><p>We ended up talking to over 160 investors. Do we know that many investors? No, not even close. Once you get your first few checks in, your investors will introduce you to other investors. In fact you should hold new investors you close to introducing you to 3 other investors. That's their job.</p><p>Most of our money raised came from warm intros (represented in the graphic above). Once we started working warm intros better, our round had life breathed back into it.<br></p><p>I cold emailed just 2 investors, and did not receive a response from either. The world of VC is&nbsp; very relationship based. We even saw this with investors who wanted to chat with us – they would specifically hunt for a warm introduction from someone we already knew.<br></p><h4><strong>Qualify</strong></h4><p>At seed, many investors you talk to will have near-zero interest in participating in your round. A lot of larger firms will want to learn about your business, build a relationship, and gather some data on your traction. These firms do a handful of Series As per year, and <em>maybe</em> 1 or 2 seed deals (across all partners, not per partner). This may sound obvious in hindsight, but we had to learn to count them differently in our investor pipeline.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Tactical Tips</h2><p><em>*Disclaimer - these things were helpful for us.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Over the years I've used every operating system. Sometimes all at once. Recently I've taken to using Linux as my primary desktop operating system. Everything I need runs natively on Linux and because I have full control over my environment I never have down time due to forced updates. This is my desktop after all so I'm really switching from Windows where the Control key modifier paradigm is more or less the same as Linux. Still I didn't want to compromise on anything with this new configuration and there was one thing missing from my Macbook that I really wanted.</p>
<p>Of course what I'm talking about is the Command key or more colloquially known simply as the Apple Key and all the shortcuts and hot keys built into macOS that make it such a joy to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/70" width="200"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Linux lets you change whatever you want."</em></p>
<p>Is a common thing that people say to bring up a positive aspect of GNU/Linux. Is this actually true though? Take for example my issue at hand: Changing copy/paste hotkeys for all programs. In truth, some tasks are so big in their scope few users would ever be capable of accomplishing them. At least not without a lot of contextual knowledge.</p>
<p>Getting macOS style hotkeys is actually an extremely difficult task in Linux. Especially when you want to avoid faking it by binding some keys to other keys on a per application basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's the question of why do it at all?</p>
<p><span><span>The truth is I just got tired of </span></span><span><span>accidentally sending SIGINTs when switching to terminal and then accidentally triggering the wrong thing when switching out of terminal. I've just gotten so used to not having to context switch my brain in macOS between programs. It's one of the things that truly makes my Macbook Pro more pleasant to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://technex.us/media/73"></span></span></p>
<p>So that's my first reason. Muscle memory.</p>
<p>My second reason is simply that Command/Meta is directly next to the space bar and I just like having a shorter stretching span for my hand.</p>

<h3>Making it work</h3>
<p>For the most part GUI applications written for Linux tend to make a lot of assumptions about what hotkeys can and should be in a very opinionated way. Some types of programs require full customization (like code editors) while others like browsers tend to force certain hotkeys. Desktop managers do provide their own hotkey bindings. For example most KDE based applications will use your settings from KDE's "System Settings" to set hotkeys. Meanwhile in Gnome you can use dbind to set your keybinds.</p>
<p>Of course Cut/Copy/Paste is not enough. It would actually be quite jarring to use CTRL+T for opening a new tab immediately after using Command+V to paste something. Indeed if you go down this path you'll end up having to redefine your hotkeys for well..... everything. It is unfortunate as well that applications these days are extremely hostile to user settings.</p>
<p>Despite the hurdles in front of me I decided to try to make it work.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was swap Left Alt and Left Meta on my keyboard. This was actually pretty easy to do with keyboard mapping configs with the KDE GUI simply known as "System Settings". This was simply to make my normal windows keyboard place the buttons in the positions a real mac keyboard would have. None of this is necessary if you have a real Apple layout keyboard. This setting is only active while in my X session so any alternative TTYs would revert back to my stock layout. If I had a real Apple layout keyboard though this is not necessary at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/71"></p>
<p>This setting is saved to the text file <code>~/.config/kxkbrc.</code></p>
<pre><code>$ cat kxkbrc 
[Layout]
DisplayNames=
LayoutList=us
LayoutLoopCount=-1
Model=pc101
Options=altwin:swap_lalt_lwin
ResetOldOptions=true
ShowFlag=false
ShowLabel=true
ShowLayoutIndicator=true
ShowSingle=false
SwitchMode=Global
Use=true
</code></pre>
<p>Now with this setting I am able to fake the same key mapping as a real macOS&nbsp;keyboard would have in my desktop session. So far so good. Now I manually changed all my hotkeys in my code editors, terminal applications, and even in the System Settings app I just mentioned to set global hot keys for all KDE applications. This took some time but was very straight forward for the most part.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/72"></p>
<p>I went above and beyond even changing my shortcuts for things like Select All.</p>
<p>While this worked for KDE applications I had to also make this change for GTK+ based programs as well. Luckily this would also cover Chrome, Discord, Elements, and a number of other Electron based programs that I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I was lucky that VSCode let me change everything but it was very annoying have to redo all the system based hotkeys like Set cursor to start of the line (in macOS this is Meta+Left Arrow) for each and every place I wanted to use it.</p>
<p>Some websites also use Meta+C for example in Github hitting Meta+C will actually take focus and bring you to the Add Comment UI when in a thread so sometimes on Github.com even with Firefox set to use Meta+C to copy something I am not actually able to use my hotkey because the website overrides it.</p>
<p>With GTK I ended up editing <code>`</code><span><code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`</code> </span><span>and setting these hotkeys.</span></p>
<pre><code>@binding-set gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
{
        bind "&lt;super&gt;x" { "cut-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;c" { "copy-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;v" { "paste-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;a" { "select-all" (1) };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;z" { "undo" () };
}

* {
        -gtk-key-bindings: gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
}
</code></pre>
<p>I might add more but for now this got me to where I wanted with most GTK+ applications. Note that if you plan to run any of programs designed to run as root that use GTK+ such as GParted you should also link or copy this config file to the root account home directory as well.</p>
<p>So in the end it is possible. I was able to achieve what I wanted with all but one program. But it was a huge pain. It's really difficult to figure out what settings do what in a Linux environment even when there is documentation. It's typical for documentation to exist for say GTK+ 2.0 and GTK+ 3.0 but there is no over arching best practice guide for what one should do when they want to cover all programs in an environment.</p>


<h3>It Doesn't Have to Be This Way</h3>
<p>The Linux ecosystem can and should do better. The ability to do whatever you want is a double edged sword where even though you can in theory change things, in practice however, sometimes changing things is so onerous that staying sane in the process is a task in itself.</p>
<p>So please if you are a Linux user space developer check the GTK+ 2.0 (<code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code>), GTK+ 3.0 (<code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css</code>) and KDE global shortcut configs (<code>~/.config/kdeglobals</code>) when you probe for the environment during startup so that people can choose their own hotkeys for their desktop environment or simply use the C libraries of each and use the hotkeys present.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you are a developer that already supports various input methods for macOS, Linux, and Windows you can simply provide a toggle for users.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to Linux Desktop environments to agree to a standard config file for hotkeys allowing users to bind keys as they see fit rather than lurching from one weird keybinding config to the next with no centralization to speak off.</p>

<p>On September 27, 1991 BBC 1 broadcast a film on Don DeLillo,
titled "Don DeLillo: The Word, The Image, and The Gun"
which was directed by Kim Evans. As of October 2013 the film has been
put up on YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DTePKA1wgc#t=14" target="BLANK">here's the link</a>.</p>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_title.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>The film is introduced as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don DeLillo writes dangerous fiction.</p>
  <p>He's been called America's leading contemporary novelist,
  and his ten novels come directly out of the flow of recent history.
  The Kennedy assassination, toxic fallout, acts of terrorism;
  these are all part of the running picture of news against which
  his books are set.</p>
  <p>This film was developed in close collaboration with DeLillo.
  He wanted to use the documentary form to explore the relationships
  between gunmen and the novelist, words and images, the power
  of news and the obsession with apocalypse. In doing so he asks,
  what effect can a novelist have on a culture in which terrorists
  seem to have hijacked the world's narrative.</p></blockquote>

<p>We then hear a bit of a broadcaster describing the Kennedys
as they move through Dallas, then a short passage from <i>Libra</i>.
DeLillo begins to speak:</p>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_delillo_at_window.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isolation, solitude, secret plotting. A novel is a secret
  a writer may keep for years before he lets it out of his room.
  Writers in hiding, writers in prison. Sometimes their secrets
  turn out to be dangerous to the state machine. For most writers
  in the West of course this danger is extremely remote. The cells
  we live in are strictly personal constructions.</p>
  <p>Let's change the room slightly and imagine another kind of
  apartness. The outsider who builds a plot around his desperation.
  A self-watcher, a lonely young man, living in a fiction he hasn't
  bothered to put down on paper. But this doesn't mean he is unorganized,
  he organizes everything. This is how he keeps from disappearing.
  His head is filled with dangerous secrets, and he may finally
  devise a way to come out of his room. He invents a false name,
  orders a gun though the mail, then looks around for someone famous
  he can shoot.</p></blockquote>
  
<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_at_typewriter.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>
  
<p>DeLillo at 5:20: "I think it's true that none of my novels could have been written in the world that
existed before the assassination.
In my fiction there seems to be a sense
of danger everywhere, of something unraveling.
  When Kennedy was shot, something changed for ever in America. Something opened up, a sense
  of randomness, deep ambiguity, we lost the narrative thread."
  
</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_suddenly.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>From <i>Libra</i> at 15:10: The first movie was <i>Suddenly</i>. Frank Sinatra is a combat veteran
who comes to a small town and takes over a house that overlooks the railwroad depot.
He is here to assassinate the President. (p. 369 in pbk)

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_suddenly_on_oswald.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>From <i>Libra</i>: Lee felt a stillness around him. He had an eerie sense he was being
watched for his reaction. He felt connected to the events on the screen. It was like secret instructions
entering the network of signals and broadcast bands, the whole busy air of transmission. 
Marina was asleep. They were running a message through the night into his skin. 

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_watching_oswald_11-53.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 18:22: "Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think the footage comes close to uncovering some secret about
the nature of film itself. Film carries something, some mindstream, some myth that may be common to us all. It's as though
the experience of film has acquired a kind of independent existence in 
our consciousness, it's that deeply embedded. Have to get it on film."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_men_on_wing.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 26:40: "With widespread political terrorism we got our narrative back, calculated acts, not random."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_3_planes.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_bill_gray_maoii.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

From <i>Mao II</i> at 28:45: Bill Gray: "Years ago I used to think it was possible for novelists to alter the life of the culture, 
but now bombmakers and gunmen have taken over that territory.  They make raids on human consciousness, what writers 
used to do, before we were all incorporated."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_nypost_catcher.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

DeLillo at 35:12: "Ordering a photograph of a famous recluse must be a little like ordering an execution. Salinger
resembles a man who's fighting for his life."

<center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_football_crowd.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<p>Tragedy at Hillsborough England (41:25) - 15 April 1989

</p><p>DeLillo at 40:54 : "Today it's news that has begun to influence the way we see the world. It's news that has
become so extraordinarily dominant. I think we've come to depend on news, the darker the better. In a way we need it, 
because it is the tragic narrative of our time." 

</p><center><img src="http://perival.com/delillo/ddbbc_watching_oswald_48-11.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3"></center>

<hr>Here's how <i>The Times</i> listed the program
(Sept 27, 1991):

<blockquote>
  <p>Kim Evan's filmed essay about an American novelist who is
  obsessed by violent images and what they can do to the soul of
  a 20th century culture like his, is dazzlingly, nay blindingly,
  assembled. The camera assumes an adversarial role. It is as much
  a weapon as the guns that feature so strongly in DeLillo's writing.
  Therefore, there are two ways of interpreting it when we talk
  of Evan's scenes being shot. More than one viewing of this film
  will be necessary for those viewers who simply can't keep up
  with what DeLillo is thinking, writing and seeing. It takes time
  to digest statments like "Stalking a victim is a way of
  organizing one's loneliness, making a network out of it"
  or "I knew I must extend myself until the molecules parted
  and I was spliced into the image." In his book <i>Mao II</i>,
  a character says "Keep it simple." Was DeLillo paying
  attention at the time?</p></blockquote>
