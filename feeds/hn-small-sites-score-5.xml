<p>While listening to a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/12/02/bgp-with-andree-toonk/">podcast discussing BGP</a> I heard the fact that AWS owns more than $2B worth of IP addresses. I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a <a href="https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/">site</a> that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size. Now it was time to figure out the IP addresses owned by Amazon. I figured this would be difficult but lucky for us AWS actually <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">publishes</a> their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.</p>

<p>The work is simply to download the JSON and then convert the CIDR blocks to the number of IPs and add them all up. As of today, December 11, 2020 AWS self reports owning 109,847,486 IPV4 addresses - at a price of $20 this is almost $2.2B and at $30 it’s almost $3.3B. That’s wild.</p>

        <p>For over two decades, the JVM (and thus Java) has ruled supreme while other runtimes have come and gone. Ruby, Python, .Net, NodeJS, have all tried to take the throne. But the JVM offered something none could: a multi-threaded, JIT-compiled, high-performance, fully backward compatible runtime.</p><p>That the JVM hasn't kept up with the times, can be demonstrated with a simple example. Say you write a small command-line utility function in Java that has dependencies on a few jars. How does one package and distribute this utility? One could look at StackOverflow to see which plugin of your favorite build system is currently popular to create a Fat Jar. However, the official 'Java way' to package your code and its dependencies is still the good old .war file. A faster moving organization would have acknowledged how users like to ship their code. They would have extended the .jar file format (or introduced a new file format) to be able to package dependencies in a standardized manner. But no such thing on the horizon with Java.</p><p>Java is moving faster than ever now, one might say. It does get 2 minor releases a year now. (Though, does anyone really use the features of non-LTS Java versions?). Sure the module system in Java 9 allowed the JVM to shed some of its weight, but major additions to the JVM which would put it on par with competition still seem to be a long way away. Project Valhalla, which was supposed to introduce 'Value Types' to Java, was announced back in 2014 and still has no release date. Project Loom, which brings green threads, was announced in 2018 and is in a similar state. Want to interop with native code, one still has to deal with the insanity of 20-year-old JNI interfaces.</p><p>One also wonders, even after these features are introduced, how compelling would they be to use compared to their implementations in other languages/runtimes. Java's Achilles heel after all is the need to maintain backward compatibility. Its that backward compatibility requirement that got us the Java Streams API, where instead of <code>myList.map(...)</code> one has to write the monstrosity that is <code>myList.stream().map(...).collect(Collectors.toList()</code>.</p><p>There was a time where Java was the best choice for almost everything. GWT on the frontend, Spring on the backend. Databases like Hadoop, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Spark, all written on top of the JVM. Java also had the absolute best IDE in Eclipse and Intellij, making it a reason to choose Java over other languages in a professional environment.</p><p>What's different in the 2020s is that over the last decade, languages/runtimes have evolved to become best in class for specific domains. They took their learnings from the JVM, finally realizing that type safety is needed and performance is important. They ackonowledged that one language/runtime doesnt fit all needs.</p><ul><li>Want to write a large, complicated UI? ReactJS and Typescript allow you to do that while providing a type system even more expressive than the JVM.</li><li>Want to write a web server? Golang allows you to handle thousands of requests at a time without the need for a thread per request. It makes concurrency so easy, the equivalent in Java would be an order of magnitude more complex.</li><li>Want to write a big data database? Rust has you covered. Deal with huge amounts of data without needing to battle the GC and interact with low-level system calls without battling with JNI or <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>.</li></ul><p>With all these languages being fully typed, Jetbrains now has been able to make equally good IDE for those languages too.</p><p>From 2020 onwards, the JVM doesn't seem to be the best choice for anything. It will continue its legacy as a big, heavyweight, one size fits all VM. Good at everything, but never the best. The future is polyglot and it's free of the JVM.</p>

for the main definitions.</em></p><p>With <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborazione_del_linguaggio_naturale"><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></a>
we refer to that interdisciplinary research field that embraces computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics,
whose purpose is to develop algorithms capable of analyzing, representing and therefore "understanding"
natural language, written or spoken, in a similar or even more efficient way than human beings.</p><p>Huge amounts of text and speech content are generated and stored nowadays. Very often
no use is made of this data, unaware of the fact that instead they represent an invaluable source of value, thanks to which
it is possible to create tools and applications which can bring a considerable added value.</p><p>By exploiting the textual and vocal content available, it is possible, for example, to create tools for::</p><ul><li><strong>Named Entity Recognition</strong>: recognize and extract entities and semantic information from the text.</li><li><strong>Text Classification</strong>: classify textual content, for example the sentiment analysis of a text (positive or negative).</li><li><strong>Entity linking</strong>: disambiguate the entities identified in the text (link the textual entities to identifying concepts).</li><li><strong>Topic Modeling</strong>: automatically extract the main topics present in a textual corpus.</li><li><strong>Autocompletion</strong>: autocompletion of a query for example.</li><li><strong>Machine translation</strong>: translation of textual content from one language to another.</li><li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: transformation of voice content into textual content (technology behind chatbots).</li></ul><p>In this first article we will cover the task known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition"><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</strong></a>.
We will see how it is possible to create a tool capable of recognizing entities in the text and what are some of its possible applications.</p><p>The Named Entity Recognition is placed within that subclass of task which in NLP is defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction"><strong>Information Extraction</strong></a>.
Through NER it is possible to identify entities in the text and associate them with the corresponding semantic categories such as persons, organizations, entities of
geopolitical type, geographic, numbers, temporal expressions and so on.</p><figure>

  </figure>   <p>We are talking about a task that has had a strong development in recent times, especially thanks to the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"><strong>Deep Learning</strong></a>.
The use of very deep neural networks has greatly increased and improved the effectiveness of entity recognition tools. <br>
Before the advent of Deep Learning, the most used tool was the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">Hidden Markov Model</a>,
a statistical model based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>, but that did not guarantee
the same performance as today's Deep Learning-based models. <br>
Two examples of training models for entity recognition will be shown later in the article, both based on the use of algorithms
made with neural networks.</p><p>The task of the Named Entity Recognition is addressed through approaches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"><strong>supervised type</strong></a>,
and for this reason it is necessary to have a set of labeled data available in order to train a model to recognize entities.
Each textual content must be labeled with the list of tokens and related tags for each entity that is to be recognized in the text.</p><p>There are several formats to represent a training dataset for Named Entity Recognition. Let's see the two most used.</p><p>A first format is the one called <strong> BILUO </strong> scheme, where the different parts of the entities are mapped according to the scheme in Figure 2.
Entities are tagged with the semantic category preceded by one of the defined prefixes.</p><figure>

This is because, through the multi-prefix scheme, they specify more detailed information in the text, which improves the capabilities of
learning of the Machine Learning algorithm used. <br>
But even using the IOB and jsonl format, very often it is possible to achieve noteworthy performance. <br>
Switching between formats is relatively simple and can be accomplished by defining rules-based procedures
easy intuition.
In addition, many NLP libraries already define predefined functions to transform your dataset into the desired format.</p><p>To label and transform data into one of these formats, there are ad hoc tools called <strong> annotators </strong>.
An annotator allows you to upload your data as plain text and then label it in a graphical environment which makes the annotation process more agile.
Annotators allow you to label data for NER, but also for textual classification tasks rather than sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p><p>In the case of NER, an annotator presents a graphic like the one below in the figure, with functionalities that allow
to carry out the annotation activity simply by highlighting the text and specifying the label to assign.</p><figure>

These tend to be generic datasets, with entities labeled with semantic categories relating to personal names, organizations, locations, dates,
temporal entities; however, it is also possible to find datasets labeled, concerning to more specific domains.
These datasets are almost always in English, but very often this problem can be overcome by using machine translation tools before carrying out
the activity of Named Entity Recognition, translating the content from the Italian language to the English language, and vice versa.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the tagged datasets on the net:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus?select=ner_dataset.csv"><strong>Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition</strong></a>: dataset

Natural Language Processing. These tools provide both pre-trained templates that are easy to use and quickly integrate into your code, and the
possibility to train new ones with your own data, using predefined modules that simplify the training of new Machine Learning tools. <br>

	  <p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot</a> is a low-cost robot kit for students, software engineers, makers to learn <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/">ROS2</a> and robotics in a hands-on manner. Our robot kits are easy to build, extensible, and customizable. The Hadabot software stack consists of an open source web browser-based coding environment to make the hacking experience frustration-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot ROS2 "Turtle" robot kits are available for purchase</a>!</p>
<hr>
<p>In a previous post, we showcased the <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/">ROS 2 turtlesim</a> running with the <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/">Navigation2 (aka Nav2)</a> package. That exercise required the use of the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a> which manages all <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/ros2-navigation-tf2-tutorial-using-turtlesim.html#what-is-tf2">the various coordinate frames of a robotics application</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, instead of turtlesim, we'll have Nav2 direct a physical Hadabot Turtle differential drive robot to a goal pose - position and orientation. This exercise will bring together rviz, tf2, Nav2 with our past writeups about the <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/implement-ros2-odometry-using-vscode-in-web-browser.html">Turtle robot's odometry and kinematics</a>. We'll touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How we compute odometry for Nav2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nav2 parameters we tweaked</p>

<h3>1. ROS 2 Nav2 with a Hadabot Turtle robot</h3>
<p>As with all Hadabot examples, you can use the Hadabot stacks browser-based VSCode to compile and run the code.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up / update your turn-key Hadabot software stack (which leverages Docker containers to ensure your code runs securely and efficiently on your local machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>you are new to Hadabot</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/new-user-software-stack-setup.html" target="_blank">steps to set up Docker and get the Hadabot software stack up and running</a> (5 to 15 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else if you are a <strong>returning Hadabot hacker</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/software-stack-update.html" target="_blank">steps to update your Hadabot software stack</a> (1-3 minutes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://localhost:9123/?folder=/home/hadabot/hadabot_main/content/p9" target="_blank">Launch the browser-based VSCode workspace specific to this post</a> (this link points to your localhost so everything is running securely on your local system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left VSCode Explorer panel, right-click the <strong>README.md</strong> file -&gt; Open Preview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the README to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update your ROS 2 packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flash the example's ESP32 firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle robot controller and coordinate frame code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch a browser-based VNC client to run the example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a go-to-goal Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/goSqLnv6jhE?start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h5>Rviz to visualize the Nav2 go-to-goal Hadabot Turtle example</h5>
<p>If you successfully ran the example, you'll notice that the Turtle starts in the middle of the "arena" (ie map). Each grid-box represents 1 meter in physical distance. The red-axis presents the Turtle pointed forward. Since ROS uses a right-handed coordinate system, positive <span>\(\omega\)</span> rotation results in the Turtle turning counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>For the video example, the goal pose was 1 meter to the Turtle's left, with a 90 degree orientation from its initial orientation. </p>
<p>Notice the Turtle didn't end up exactly 1 meter to its left, nor was it oriented exactly 90 degrees from its initial pose. This is due to 2 reasons due to nothing happening exactly in the real world (this is not a simulation anymore Dorothy) - (1) the Hadabot Turtle's speed sensors have errors which accumulates over time resulting in odometry drift, and (2) Nav2 goal checker allows for a tolerance in both distance and orientation from the specificed end-goal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. How we construct TF2 messages from odometry</h3>
<p>The Hadabot Turtle publishes each wheel's rotational velocity in radians per second. With the measured wheelbase and wheel radius of the Turtle, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead-reckoning</a> to determine how far each wheel has traveled in meters.</p>
<p>Once we know how far each wheel has traveled for our differential drive model, we can compute the linear distance and angular rotation <span>\((v, \omega)\)</span> for a unicycle model, which allows us to update the current pose and velocities of our Hadabot Turtle as an <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html">Odometry ROS message</a>. All this is done in the <em>hadabot_controller.cpp</em> file.</p>
<p>Then we use effectively the same code as the turtlesim example to extract the pose information from the Odometry message and publish that out as tf2 messages which is used by Nav2 and rviz.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Setting up Nav2 for the Hadabot Turtle</h3>
<p>Nav2 is a complex ROS 2 package with a number of sub-packages / components around 3 main capabilities - localization, planning/controller, and mapping. For our go-to-goal example, we mainly use the planning/controller component.</p>
<p>There are conceptually 2 types of planners in Nav2 - a global planner, and a local planner. The global planner computes a global trajectoy to get to our goal pose. The local planner references the global plan to determine the best linear and angular velocity for the robot to undertake to safely move along the global trajectory. </p>
<p>The global planner (as of 2020-12) defaults to a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> based planner. The local planner is called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/236487972">DWB planner, initially created by David Lu back in the ROS 1 days</a>, which implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm</a> created by Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun. The DWB planner is driven by "critics" which vote on various local trajectories to undertake. Each critic "cares" about a certain behavior (ie avoiding abstacles, avoiding oscillation, going fast, etc). The local trajectory with the highest vote wins and that results as the Twist message command to direct the robot's current velocities.</p>
<p>Configuring Nav2 for our go-to-goal example involved tuning the parameters for the planning/controller. The ones we tweaked for the Hadabot Turtle are the max velocities of our robot, and controller update frequency (to update frequently enough but not so much that it floods our "hobbyist" network capabilities). There are many other <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/index.html">Nav2 parameters we can consider and tune</a>, which can be a series of posts and exercises on its own. </p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this post, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Showed a example of running a physical real-life Hadabot Turtle robot using ROS 2 Nav2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We described how we use dead-reckoning to compute the Turtle's pose and velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked a bit about Nav2 and what we tweaked to get our goal-to-goal example to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In future posts, we can take this exercise down 2 separate threads - (1) to walk through some of the Nav2 parameters in more detail, start looking closer at Nav2, or (2) to showcase a Hadabot Turtle with a skirt of range-sensors (add-on for the base Turtle kit) to further explore localization and then SLAM with Nav2.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with various professors to create a more structured ROS 2 robotics syllabus and curriculum.</p>

            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy, intended to illustrate in the simplest possible way how specialization gets punished when transfers are taxed in proportion to their values. The current reality not <em>nearly</em> this bad due to many complex exemptions, as I discuss at the end. But the flaw described <em>does</em> exist and <em>does</em> punish specialization. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WHERE THE SAME UNIT OF VALUE IS TAXED MULTIPLE TIMES PLEASE READ THIS LINK.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/vat.jpg" alt="vat"></p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>

      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

  <li>The initial map is based on Wikipedia, but found that many places (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/thailand/corporate/other-taxes">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/05/tnf-saudi-arabia-vat-rate-to-increase-to-15-percent-covid-19.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran#Value_added_tax_(VAT)">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/om/en/pages/tax/articles/oman-to-implement-vat-from-2021.html">Oman</a>, <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/valueaddedtaxvat">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-economy-tax-idUSKCN1IG0OW">Kuwait</a>, <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-early-days-for-angola-value-added-tax">Angola</a>, <a href="https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/liberia-to-introduce-vat-2019.html">Liberia</a>) have recently implemented VAT. I checked that most of the others (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jordan/corporate/other-taxes">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/france/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/7685.aspx?lang=eng#valuetax">French Guinana</a>, <a href="https://www.nordeatrade.com/en/explore-new-market/cuba/taxes">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/libya/individual/other-taxes">Libya</a>, Hong Hong) still do not have a VAT.</li>
  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">YES</a>.</li>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Can we build a fully-fledged Federated Learning system in less than 20 lines of code? Spoiler alert: yes, we can.</p><p><a href="https://flower.dev/">Flower</a> was built with a strong focus on usability. This blog post shows how we can use Flower and <a href="https://tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> to train <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381">MobilNetV2</a> on <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> - in just 19 lines of code.
The system will start one server and two clients, each holding their own local dataset.</p><h2>Flower client</h2><p>Let's first build the client in <code>client.py</code>.
The client starts by importing Flower (<code>flwr</code>) and TensorFlow, compiling the model (MobileNetV2), and loading the data (CIFAR-10):</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span></span><span>import</span><span> tensorflow </span><span>as</span><span> tf
</span>
<span></span><span># Load and compile Keras model</span><span>
</span><span>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2((</span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>), classes=</span><span>10</span><span>, weights=</span><span>None</span><span>)
</span><span>model.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>"adam"</span><span>, </span><span>"sparse_categorical_crossentropy"</span><span>, metrics=[</span><span>"accuracy"</span><span>])
</span>
<span></span><span># Load CIFAR-10 dataset</span><span>
</span>(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
</code></pre></article></div><p>This should look familiar to anyone who has prior experience with TensorFlow or Keras.
Next, we build a Flower client called <code>CifarClient</code> which is derived from Flower's convenience class <code>KerasClient</code>.
The abstract base class <code>KerasClient</code> defines three methods that clients need to override.
These methods allow Flower to trigger training and evaluation of the previously defined Keras model:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Define Flower client</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CifarClient</span><span>(</span><span>fl.client.keras_client.KerasClient</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_weights</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights()
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<span>        model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=</span><span>1</span><span>, batch_size=</span><span>32</span><span>, steps_per_epoch=</span><span>3</span><span>)  </span><span># Remove `steps_per_epoch=3` to train on the full dataset</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights(), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train)
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<!-- -->        loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(x_test), loss, accuracy</span></code></pre></article></div><p>Flower's <code>KerasClient.fit</code> method receives weights from the server, updates the model with those weights, trains the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_train</code>/<code>y_train</code>), and then returns the updated weights (via <code>model.get_weights</code>).
Note that you can do a quick "dry run" by passing <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to <code>model.fit</code> - this will only process three batches per epoch instead of the entire dataset.
Remove <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to train on the full dataset (this will take longer).</p><p>The <code>evaluate</code> method works similarly, but it uses the provided weights to evaluate the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_test</code>/<code>y_test</code>).
The last step is to create an instance of <code>CifarClient</code> and run it:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Start Flower client</span><span>
</span><span>fl.client.start_keras_client(server_address=</span><span>"[::]:8080"</span><span>, client=CifarClient())</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it for the client. We create the model, load the data, implement a subclass <code>KerasClient</code>, and start the client. Let's build the server script next.</p><h2>Flower server</h2><p>In a new script called <code>server.py</code>, we add the following two lines to start a Flower server that performs three rounds of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf">Federated Averaging</a>:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span>fl.server.start_server(config={</span><span>"num_rounds"</span><span>: </span><span>3</span><span>})</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it! We can now run our system. Are we still within our lines of code limit? Lines of code (excluding blank lines or comments): 19 <!-- -->🎉</p><h2>Running the system</h2><p>First, we start the server:</p><p>Next, we open a new terminal and start the first client:</p><p>Finally, we open another new terminal and start the second client:</p><p>This should result in the following output in terminal 2 or 3 (one of those running <code>client.py</code>).
We can see that three rounds of federated learning improve the accuracy to about 46% on the training set and 28% on the test set (if we train on the full dataset, so no <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code>).
There's obviously lots of room for improvement, for example, by doing more rounds of federated learning and by tuning hyperparameters. </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>DEBUG flower </span><span>2020</span><span>-12</span><span>-04</span><span> </span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>57</span><span>:</span><span>18</span><span>,</span><span>259</span><span> | connection.py:</span><span>36</span><span> | ChannelConnectivity.IDLE

    <p><a href="https://ssb.fit/"><em>Smash Training</em></a> is a spaced-repetition training web-app I created to help my progression with <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. I released it on May 16, 2020 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gkybpe/trying_to_get_into_elite_smash_this_quarantine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a> to warm reception. As of December 2020, it receives 150-200 monthly users. I’d rank it as my most successful project!</p>

<p>In this article, I discuss the choices I made for this project. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining">https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining</a>.</p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project requirements</h2>

<p>I decided that I wanted to build a spaced-repetition training app, rather than reuse a general-purpose spaced-repetition flash-card system such as Anki, because the project would benefit from domain-specific knowledge. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercises have large numbers of variants, such as “short-hop” vs “full-hop”, or “facing left” vs “facing right”, which should be tracked separately.</li>
  <li>Many of the exercises have natural dependencies on others: they shouldn’t be attempted unless a certain underlying fundamental skill has been mastered.</li>
  <li>Exercises to train one character don’t necessarily confer the same skill for other characters. Some exercises may only be applicable to some characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to make an app to automate the spaced repetition regimen I was attempting to follow by hand, which I could then share with others.</p>

<p>Here were my engineering requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should be mobile-first, but preferably also available on desktop.</li>
  <li>Should be local-first, or at least not require creating an account to use.</li>
  <li>Should be architected to support sync between devices, although the sync itself was not a requirement for the first iteration.</li>
  <li>Should have approximately zero hosting costs.</li>
  <li>Should be hosted on of a stable platform which doesn’t require monitoring (e.g. not my home computer).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain name</h2>

<p>I wanted to choose between a permutation like the following for the domain name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smashtraining.com</li>
  <li>ssbtraining.com</li>
  <li>smash.training</li>
  <li>ssb.training</li>
  <li>smash.fit</li>
  <li>ssb.fit</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I used <code>ssb.fit</code> because 1) <code>smash.training</code> got taken (!) and 2) I wanted to optimize for typing it in on a mobile device, even though the name is less memorable. This lack of memorability unfortunately manifested in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gp9sem/wtf_was_that_smash_training_website_called/frkscwe/?context=3">this Reddit thread titled “WTF was that smash training website called?”</a>. However, another commenter writes “ssb.fit is better, short for mobile”, perhaps vindicating the original choice.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that the domain name and the website title don’t exactly match up. Many people seemed to address it as “ssb.fit” hence, so maybe that’s what the project should have been called too (rather than “Smash Training”).</p>

<h2 id="user-studies-and-ui">User studies and UI</h2>

<p>I conducted several user studies with friends and family, including some people who had played Smash before and some who hadn’t.</p>

<h3 id="ui">UI</h3>

<p>The first main thing I iterated on was the design of the exercise tracker widget. I originally based it off of the <em>Stronglifts</em> app:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png" alt="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app." title="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p><em>Stronglifts</em> has you note down how many repetitions of the exercise you succeeded at (out of five). However, the <em>Smash Training</em> paradigm is different, and has you repeat the exercise for a length of time and rate your accuracy.</p>

<p>I experimented with a “smiley-face” UI rather than a rep-count UI, as in Stronglifts, along with a few other options. After a lot of feedback from friends, I arrived at a slider-based widget like this:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png" alt="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget." title="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This uses a slider approach (with five possible notches), and renders a description of what each notch corresponds to, i.e. “all or nearly all reps correct”.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>The second main thing was the ordering of the elements in the “Learn exercise” page. Each exercise has a step-by-step description of how to do the exercise, what controller inputs must be performed, background on the technique and its importance, a video tutorial, etc.</p>

<p>My assumption was that most people would read very little of it, so I should put the most important items first. However, various users disagreed on which item was the most important. There was no strong consensus, but the end result was this ordering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step-by-step exercise description.</li>
  <li>Controller inputs.</li>
  <li>Technique overview.</li>
  <li>The rest of the documentation elements (not as important).</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also hints on these steps such as how to enter the Training Stage to perform the exercises. Some users missed these steps altogether, and were left confused on how to perform the exercise. Unfortunately, I was unable to design a UI that mitigated this problem.</p>

<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h2>

<p>I chose to write a web-app, since they are cross-platform and I already had some familiarity with the area. In particular, I didn’t want to spend money on an iOS developer license, but I also didn’t want to exclude iOS users. (Post-hoc analytics indicate that the ratio of Android-to-iOS users is about 2:1, which consitutes a significant cohort for iOS.)</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build system</h3>

<p>All Javascript web-app bundling solutions are fundamentally terrible, and Webpack is no exception. But it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/f621f02af95da697435cb720563b590d57f38b87">I encountered one mysterious bug in Babel during development</a>, which I was unable to isolate. I worked around it by targeting only newer browsers, after which the problem disappeared.</p>

<p>I used <code>vue-cli-service</code> as a wrapper around the build, test, and lint actions, as recommended by Vue. But I found it hard to configure and debug. When I had an issue with tests not properly compiling an imported module, <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/blame/d0c31a33ab880e8c58824c0f58247c8bd8f38485/src/utils.ts#L38-L44">I gave up and reimplemented the function I needed myself</a>.</p>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, since I find its static typing system useful for maintenance purposes.</p>

<p>TypeScript support for Vue was not ideal. Many Vue patterns are not easy to express in TypeScript. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/istrib/vuex-typescript"><code>vuex-typescript</code></a> exist, but require a lot of boilerplate in order to get static typing support. The <a href="https://github.com/paroi-tech/direct-vuex"><code>direct-vuex</code></a> library had less boilerplate, but <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/9a8c0c0baf05d048a564b11f62afdfafc9f66a62">I couldn’t figure out how to test it</a>.</p>

<p>TypeScript was generally pleasant to work with, although in the project, I pushed it to its extremes and it was unable to keep pace. In my case, it was unable to track associated/mapped types adequately. It’s perhaps exemplified by this <code>@ts-ignore</code> comment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>TechVariantOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TechId</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// @ts-ignore "Type 'x' cannot be used to index type 'AllTechVariants'."</span>
  <span>// Strangely, the correct type is calculated here anyways, and can be used for</span>
  <span>// exhaustiveness-checking later.</span>
  <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>AllTechMetadata</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>variants</span><span>"</span><span>]]:</span> <span>AllTechVariants</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13215#issuecomment-531632919">this issue</a> when working on the same thing.</p>

<p>Given that this is reasonably advanced type-level hackery, I was generally happy with TypeScript’s ability to describe the data domain.</p>

<h3 id="vue">Vue</h3>

<p>I chose to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> as the front-end web framework, since I had heard good things about it from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. In particular, I wanted an opinionated framework, so as to spend less time configuring things myself.</p>

<p>When I used it, Vue promoted the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">“single-file component”</a> system, in which HTML, CSS, and Javascript are mixed into the same file. It was not a great experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This complicates the build process, as something has to convert these single-file components into assets consumable by the browser.</li>
  <li>The mental model is an extra layer of indirection, as these single-file components are themselves compiled into Javascript classes, but also contain Javascript classes in the script portion of the file.</li>
  <li>The tooling support was poor. For example, go-to-definition doesn’t work on the HTML components, despite the fact that they’re ultimately backed by Javascript classes.</li>
  <li>TypeScript does not check the HTML components.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would have preferred to use a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">JSX</a> solution, as it removes some of the indirection and has better tooling support.</p>

<p>I wish Vue had fewer ways to do things. For example, attributes on HTML elements can be set with the normal <code>=</code> syntax, but also with a leading <code>:</code> (expression evaluation) or a leading <code>@</code> (callback) for brevity. In comparison, React with JSX only has <code>=</code> for all of these situations.</p>

<h3 id="vuetify">Vuetify</h3>

<p><a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/">Vuetify</a> is a library to provide Material Design UI for Vue. The presence of a solid, all-in-one Material Design library was one other reason why I chose to use Vue. The library and documentation are both very good, and I was able to prototype my app (from a UI perspective) effectively. I would strongly recommend it if you’re using Vue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/8877">I opened one pull request</a> for the documentation, which was merged promptly, <a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/10140">and +1’d one documentation issue</a>, which has a workaround but unfortunately remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="netlify-for-hosting">Netlify for hosting</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host the front-end of the website using its free tier, and stored data locally for the user. This worked well, as Netlify knew how to build and deploy my Vue project, and had good Github integrations.</p>

<p>Another option would have been Github Pages, which would have made the project dependent on fewer underlying services, but also would have required me to write a build step of my own.</p>

<h3 id="custom-database">Custom database</h3>

<p>I stored data locally on the client using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"><code>localStorage</code> APIs</a>. I was careful to design the data schema such that it was append-only and such that each record had a unique ID, the idea being to make it easy to merge changes from multiple clients. However, this alone makes it difficult to delete records without some more thought.</p>

<p>I later discovered <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> as a distributed document-store in exactly the manner I had already architected my application, but including sync and delete capabilities. I also discovered the <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> library, which exposes a CouchDB interface and allows you to store your data locally or sync it remotely. It also supports more backends than just <code>localStorage</code>.</p>

<p>I wish I had used PouchDB from the beginning! Now I’m stuck with an inefficient, feature-lacking implementation of it, which would …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I recently created a series of articles and videos that goes through the
development of Kubernetes custom resources and controllers (see
<a href="https://gum.co/kubernetes-crds">gum.co/kubernetes-crds</a>), but I missed that
nice catchy example that would showcase what custom resources are all about.</p>
<p>So, why not implement the ultimate missing feature that Kubernetes should have?</p>

<h2 id="wait-but-why">wait, but why?</h2>
<p>no no, wait, <strong>why not</strong>?</p>
<p>see, with CI/CD being part of Kubernetes through projects like Argo and Tekton,
where you declare what your pipeline/workflow will be in terms of Kubernetes
resources, we’re now able to get that nice pizza for the team after a
successfull release.</p>

</code></pre><p>i don’t know about you, but that sounds quite right to me <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<h2 id="installation">installation</h2>
<p>being a legit Kubernetes custom resource, you install it just like you would
install Tekton, kpack, or anything like that: you submit a manifest that
contains the <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> objects to Kubernetes, a <code>Deployment</code>
that materializes the controller as a container in a pod, and then … that’s
it!</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller
cd pizza-controller

kapp deploy -a pizza-controller -f ./config/release.yaml


# OR .. plain old kubectl
#
kubectl apply -f ./config/release.yaml
</code></pre><h2 id="but-thats-dumb">but, that’s dumb</h2>
<p>i disagree</p>
<p>I think it’s a pretty cool example of the concepts behind extending
kubernetes via custom resources, and something that might bring you some
thoughts of ways in which you could bring the
declarative nature of Kubernetes objects plus the level-triggered approach to
controllers to bring to Kubernetes the ability to request external resources.</p>
<p>for instance, projects like <a href="https://crossplane.io/">crossplane</a> give you pretty
much that, except that instead of ordering a pizza, you’re ordering … a
database (or things like that).</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h2>
<p>are you <em>really</em> into ordering pizza using <code>kubectl</code>?</p>
<p>like, really? are you sure?</p>
<p>here’s what’s missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>well, any .. tests :horse:</li>
<li>order tracking (it’s <code>xml</code>-based - SOAP stuff)</li>
<li>being more flexible with non-canadian folks (it’s currently hardcoded for
Canada, but could easily be changed)</li>
</ul>
<p>at the moment I got my pizza .. development finished :sweat_smile: maybe you’ll
carry it forward? head to <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller">https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller</a></p>

<p>It's been a really long ride at <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a>.</p><p>I've been through the highest highs, and the lowest lows.</p><p>But now, looking back on it all, with $9.99 coming into my bank account every month <em>just like clockwork</em>, I can definitively say:</p><p>It's all been worth it.</p><p>Here is the story of how I managed to turn 7 years of my life into cold, hard cash.</p><p>And not just any amount of cash.</p><p>$9.99 so far.</p><h2 id="you-can-t-succeed-without-starting">You can't succeed without starting</h2><p>7 years ago, I was just another incredibly privileged highly-skilled software developer whose parents can support him indefinitely meaning he doesn't have to get a proper job and can risk it all on starting a business, even though his Uncle Les offered him a good, stable living as a junior accountant at his firm, as his mum never goddamn stops reminding him.</p><p>Today, I am the CEO of a successful startup.</p><p>How did I get there?</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>I started.</p><p>One day, I woke up and navigated to <a href="https://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a>.</p><p>You might not have heard of it if you aren't a software developer.</p><p>It's a place you go to buy startup websites.</p><p>It's really that simple. You think of a name, and then you go there and type it in.</p><p>In <em>seconds, </em>you'll have results showing you whether your name is available.</p><p>For me, it took a few tries to get it right. I started off trying <code>business.com</code> Â&nbsp;because I wanted my business to have a name that made it clear that it was a business.</p><p>But it was already taken.</p><p>So I moved onto <code>company.com</code>. That was taken too.</p><p>Eventually I landed on https://cloak.ist.</p><p>The journey had started.</p><h2 id="the-long-hard-slog">The long hard slog</h2><p>But boy, it was one hell of a journey.</p><p>This is where another key startup concept comes in:</p><p><em>The pivot.</em></p><p>I wasn't always banking hot, fresh Benjamins from selling custom domains as a service, like I do now.</p><p>I went through 365 different products <em>a year</em> before I settled on custom domains.</p><p>You might be thinking 'Huh, strange â€“ that's the exact number of days in a year'.</p><p>You've hit the nail on the head. Cloakist started off by offering NCaaS.</p><p>Neighborhood-Chores-as-a-service.</p><p>They say you should start with a problem that you see in real life.</p><p>Well, in my mum's neighborhood, I saw hundreds of problems.</p><p>And there were people willing to pay for <em>all of them!</em></p><p>There was Mr Baxter, whose toilet got blocked by his cat. That was a particularly hard pivot to make.</p><p>There were many, many clients in the plus-age category who needed ambulatory assistance with regards to pedestrian activity.</p><p>In other words, they needed help crossing the road.</p><p>And there was teaching coding to the kids at the local primary school, until the bullying became too much for me to handle.</p><p>But here's why none of those NCaaS offerings could ever have worked:</p><p><em>I wasn't getting recurring revenue.</em></p><p>None of my customers came back for a second time.</p><p>It wasn't anything to do with me.

December 11, 2020 | https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html">archive.org</a>

    <p>Rust has an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-next/dbg-macro.html">amazing dbg macro</a> that lets you quickly set up an expression printer that will also put in the source line. It also returns the value of the expression so you can even easily inline the printing when you want to! </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Doing a bunch of Python, I <em>want this</em> in Python as well. I want a debug macro, one that gives me the file location + the expression used to calculate the value.</p>
<p>My <em>ideal</em> would be to have a function where <code>dbg(foo.bar[1])</code> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>print <code>[source line] foo.bar[1] = &lt;the value&gt;</code></li>
<li>return the value so we can use it within expressions easily</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing this by hand I always reach for <code>f</code>-strings, to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"foo.bar[1]=</span><span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is annoying because you end up typing the same expression twice, you can't inline it, and it just doesn't look very cool.</p>
<p>The first thing when trying to implement this is to come to terms with Python's lack of macros. You can't really mess with the syntax tree, so you're really only operating on calculated values. So it's really hard to capture an expression <em>and its result</em> in a single operation because, well, your expressions get evaluated.</p>
<p>So it'll be hard, to print <code>some_expr = &lt;result of some_expr&gt;</code> without providing the string of <code>some_expr</code> at one point.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, thanks to <code>eval</code>, you can flip this idea on its head. You <em>need</em> the string for the expression, but you don't need the expression itself!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'bar'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar'[]"</span><span>))</span> <span># prints 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One step backwards, let's now go two steps forward. We can start writing our <code>dbg</code> helper function</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"bar"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>  <span># foo['bar'] = 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good, we have a nice pretty printer here at the cost of two quotation marks.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't work perfectly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span> <span># expr = expr</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that when calling <code>eval</code> without arguments we are evaluating <em>within the scope of <code>dbg</code></em>. Our examples work because <code>dbg</code> is defined alongside our expressions (so <code>foo</code> is accessible within <code>dbg</code>) but it's susceptible to name shadowing or outright not being able to calculate the expression because it could be defined in a different scope</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span># we're calculating the result here....</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span># but actually want to calculate</span>
<span># the result within this scope</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>eval</code> by default will evaluate the expression within the current frame. But we can pass in our own globals and locals to instead evaluate the expression within an arbitrary environment</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>}))</span> <span># gives 4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let's reproduce the caller's environment to get us the right results. Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, <em>getting source code</em>, inspecting classes and functions, and <em>examining the interpreter stack</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try out <code>inspect.stack()</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>

<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Passed"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>trying this out, we get the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this is in a function call we'll actually need to go up the stack one frame (<code>inspect.stack()[1]</code>) to get the proper line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'dbg("foo[</span><span>\'</span><span>bar</span><span>\'</span><span>]")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'dbg("expr")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'if dbg("True"):</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, now we are getting closer to where we need. the second element in our stack is where we'll also get the file path and the line number. Let's clean this up a bit and now we get:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we have the full file path... one might do a trick here to stick with the file name:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>filename</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"[</span><span>{</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>{</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>lineno</span><span>}</span><span>] </span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so with this we end up with the following nice printed output</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so this is good on the formatting. But we still haven't fixed <code>eval</code>! That's a tiny fix this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_globals</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_locals</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gets us the right values, properly evaluating <code>expr</code> from the calling scope instead of <code>dbg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> 
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_locals</code> on the frames is still one of my favorite Python features. It lets basically anyone write very good debugging tools without having to do a bunch of magic.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you're an IPython user you can add this to <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-startup-files">a startup script</a>  over in <code>~/.ipython/profile_default/</code> and make this available in any interactive shell.</p>
<p>For those who value silly things like correctness, performance, and intellectual integrity your journey ends here. This is a nice little helper that you can use in your projects, and there's nothing else for you to see here.</p>
<p>For those who like to live dangerously, I have something to show you.....</p>
<p>



So.</p>
<p>Inside the frame, we have a bunch of information, but one thing that's pretty nice for explorative debugging is the <code>code_context</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
<span># prints dbg('foo["bar"]')</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we actually have the source line from the <code>dbg</code> call built in!</p>
<p>Let's imagine going back a bit to our "idealized" debug function:</p>


<p>Now, if we ran such a function, the body would receive the <em>value</em> of <code>foo['bar']</code> and not the expression. <em>But</em> thanks to the stack we could theoretically recover the original expression! </p>
<p>This gets a bit tricker if you want to do more clever stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>)))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
   <span>do_stuff</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But let's try to work this out from first principles a bit.</p>
<p>If you have the source code line with the <code>dbg</code> call, how can you recover the expression being debugged?</p>
<p>The first thing is just to find the beginning of the expression. That's pretty easy, just look for <code>dbg(</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
   ^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we find the beginning of the expression, right? And since a function call in Python is an open parentheses, some expressions, then a close parentheses, we just have to find the close parentheses and we have the string fragment representing our expression. Let's apply the logic here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great! Our expression is <code>my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "(</code>. Definitely what we wanted. Yep.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where the only way to parse out an expression is to actually parse it out. Simple string matching won't cut it, especially when you start getting inner function calls in the mix.</p>
<p>You could write a simple parser, try and count parens, open quotes, escaping in quotes, all the fun little games. But honestly I want a thing that works, and I don't want to think about it too hard.</p>
<p>I just want to find out where the expression is in this string.</p>
<p>So here's my amazing plan to deal with this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == '</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")'</span><span>)</span>
<span># doesn't fail =&gt; I have my expression!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just start with the longest possible string, and slowly shrink it until I find something that looks like an expression. Because the <code>)</code> from the debug call imbalances everything I'm like... 80% sure that this way of finding the expression is correct.</p>
<p>There are some edge cases that make this strategy not work. For example if you do something like:</p>


<p>You have two <code>dbg</code>s on the same line, so it's hard to know <em>which</em> call you're in, because you're only provided the line number. (On some other project I spent a lot of time hand-wringing on this exact problem and could not find a solution, even with tricks like counting executions. I'm fairly convinced this is equivalent to the halting problem somehow)</p>
<p>And to be honest my solution here isn't battle-tested, it just feels right and works with the complicated expressions I've thrown at it. But it was a fun thing to write and now the following works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>])</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 49] foo["bar"] = 3</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 52] my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()") = 5</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Success"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No more stringifying silliness, no more calls to <code>eval</code>, just a really silly parsing hack that has no real foundation except my gut feeling. </p>
<p>Good enough for me!</p>
<p>the final implemetaion is below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Recover the expression giving the result, and then</span>

<p><strong>Download: </strong><a href="http://rickroderick.org/download/1991%20Nietzsche%20and%20the%20Post-Modern%20Condition/2%20-%20Nietzsche%20on%20Truth%20and%20Lie.mov">Nietzsche and the Post-Modern Condition (1991) Lecture 2: Nietzsche on Truth and Lie.mov</a></p>

<p><strong>Transcript: </strong>Lecture two will attempt to answer one of the paradoxes I raised in the first lecture – and this will be a specific form of it – and that’s a rather famous charge in philosophy. In fact this is the charge of relativism and one of the things that professional philosophers do in order to display their professional credentials is to respond to the relativist and to the sceptic. Nietzsche has been accused of being a relativist. One form of this accusation is a kind of mislabelling – in my opinion it’s a mislabelling – of Nietzsche’s view about the function of truth and lie. He opposes that to true and false. Truth and lie. The function of that within philosophical discourse. He has an account of that we are going to discuss. <span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>One of the ways that philosophers have mislabelled this position is “perspectivism”, and the reason I hate that label is like “relativism”, it makes someone think that someone – in this case Nietzsche, or someone else – might hold the absolutely ridiculous view that every view was as good as every other view. That is a complete straw person argument. No-one has ever – or does now – hold the view that every view is as good as every other view.</p>
<p>So whenever the spectre of relativism is raised, you know, by someone for you, either in the popular press or in a university setting, the first small thing that should come to your mind is there aren’t any. So the refutation in a certain sense is bound to miss at least one point, namely that you are not arguing against anyone. Now it could be the case that my audience today, or the audience that will watch the tapes, I will find someone in the United States, or across the world that will hold the view that every other view is as good as every other view. But if I do, it will be very idiosyncratic, and in my experience so far, no.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is not a relativist, and I think perspectivism is also an unfortunate term to describe Nietzsche’s style of thinking. Because perspectivism calls up the idea that, “Well, I am right from my perspective, and you are right from your perspective, and everybody is right from their perspectives”, and I also don’t believe that that’s a view that anyone can hold or has ever held. I think, and this is the the way I will try to discuss Nietzsche’s paradox in terms of relativism, is that…</p>
<p>Nietzsche was opposed to what might be called the dogmatism of not only the Western Philosophical tradition, but the Western Theoretical tradition in general. Its dogmatism in this regard. Believing… about its beliefs that they were good not only for them and their tribe… because after all Western Civilisation is a big word… it’s a strange word… you know, big words and strange words, but, after all it is just a very large tribe with very large armies and lots of televisions… and a large historical project, but still its a tribe. Big, big tribe.</p>
<p>I think Nietzsche considered it dogmatic to hold that your beliefs – or the beliefs of your tribe – were binding on all. That is the way I want to present Nietzsche’s perspectivism. In other words, he didn’t believe that all beliefs were equally good, interesting, or whatever. In fact, I am sure he considered some of his own beliefs to be far more interesting than for example, the beliefs of John Stuart Mill, who he referred to as “That blockhead”. Or I think that he found his views more interesting than the views of the English Utilitarians in general, about whom he said “No human beings want to be happy. Only the British want that”. [crowd laughter]. So I think he thinks his views were more interesting than those.</p>
<p>And I think where the dogmatism for Nietzsche came in was when you search for views… and then develop your beliefs, and then think that they should be binding on all. This is not a criticism that you shouldn’t have beliefs, or that all your beliefs are no better than anyone else’s. It’s just the further belief about your beliefs that everyone else should believe the same damn way. So it’s a meta-belief, if you will. A belief about your beliefs.</p>
<p>In fact I think that it’s perfectly consistent to believe a wide number of things with a great deal of passion, and then believe about those beliefs that you could be wrong. I hope that’s not a further paradox, I do not think that it is. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent to believe something passionately, to believe it in a very deep way and have a belief about that belief that “Well, you know. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p>So the dogmatism that Nietzsche is after runs very deep in our theoretical traditions. I can’t overestimate this. It’s a dogmatism that has continued throughout what might be called the project of the West, and it’s even built into the Socratic pursuit. When Socrates asks the question “What is X?”, and what fills in the “X” are those famous Greek ideals; virtue, excellence, beauty, goodness, and so on. Now Nietzsche had the highest respect for Socrates, and as I just said, as I said before, Nietzsche considered him to be an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary', 'exemplary']);">exemplary</a> person, coupled with Plato’s construction of him, they in a way were ideal for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But the dogmatic part of Socrates was that Socrates wanted – for Nietzsche – Socrates wanted an answer to the question “What is X”, like what is beauty, goodness, truth, excellence. It wouldn’t be good for just Socrates, or good for the Greeks, but once discovered had to bind everyone. In other words, it wouldn’t be enough just to believe it, which seems… what Nietzsche calls the gay, happy theorist to be enough, to just find a belief that you can live with and believe. No, the theoretical enterprise of the West is imperialistic in a way. It’s got to find a belief that others then have to believe, and that he considered dogmatic.</p>
<p>This by the way you may notice is not – in my view – a relativist position at all. Because it’s not inconsistent with the view that you think your beliefs – precisely because they are your beliefs – are superior to some other beliefs. In fact I take it to be banally the case that if you didn’t think that, they wouldn’t be your beliefs. In other words, somebody comes up to you and gives you some other ones and you go “Oh hell, those are better than mine”. Then they will be yours after you have heard them out, right? So it seems fairly natural that you believe your beliefs. The dogmatic assumption is that everyone else should believe your beliefs. And this is not relativism. There have been some modern philosophical names attached to this position called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism', 'fallibilism']);">fallibilism</a>, and yet Nietzsche is too interesting in a certain way to be called that either.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to present Nietzsche not specifically within that philosophical context, but I do want to present him as addressing it, which he does. And anyone who has ever addressed any issue in philosophy knows that the irritating thing is how the simplest questions can turn into philosophical ones. Sometimes philosophers realise that what we do is ask a series of rhetorical questions that come up whenever people are very frustrated. In other words, we ask questions like “What the hell does that mean?”. You know, generally in a fight – a domestic fight – a rhetorical question. “I can’t do the dishes now” – “Well what the hell does that mean?”. Well, the philosopher takes that rhetorical question and just places it in a foreign context. Someone goes “There’s an object” and you go “Object… what the hell does that mean?” [crowd laughter]. In the other context, the remark had a home and a meaning, and so it means that the person’s <em>pissed</em>, I guess. Or <em>upset</em>, okay. In this other context though, “What does it – you know – does it mean?” doesn’t seem to have any purchase.</p>
<p>About those, sort of, metaphysical beliefs, Nietzsche was no metaphysician. In fact, he thought that was, in a way, a very pompous thing to be. To try to answer those kinds of questions in a way binding for all. Now I call that a kind of <em>imperialism</em>, and I didn’t use that political term without thinking about it for a while. It’s the kind of imperialism – this dogmatic tradition against which Socrates saw himself fighting – is the kind of imperialist tradition we might have in some of our educational institutions when we have an African-American student who speaks eloquent rap street language talk. And I am not trying to say that’s all that African-Americans speak. Some of them are Neo-Conservatives that garble around as bad as others. Paleo-Conservatives. You know, some are just as unfortunately stupid as their Anglo-American, or Anglo-Saxon counterparts.</p>
<p>No, but I mean I am talking now about, you know, someone who does… says “ain’t” and repeats themselves, rhymes and things. Well, in a way it’s just imperialistic to think that that is somehow less profound than the Cambridge accent that discusses in detail the problem of relativism. It is not only a class and a racial bias, it’s just stupid. Because, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James', 'William James']);">William James</a> once said “The trail of the human serpent is over all”. There are many forms of life, many cultures, many ways to look at things. And Nietzsche at his best expresses in his work that diversity and that complexity of the many ways to interpret, to speak.</p>
<p>Now, “imperialistic” in this educational sense means that we want you to leave our institutions of higher learning talking like we talk and writing like we write. And we divide through by the issue of whether you think at all, because all the evidence we have for that is what you have said and what you have written. You may be not thinking at all, or thinking very bizarre thoughts, or you may be on some hallucinogenic drug, who knows what’s inside. But if you leave there writing like we write, talking like we talk – in short obeying relations of power – then you are educated. You certainly… and certainly Nietzsche saw this as conformity, and not connected with truth.</p>
<p>So …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p><em>I first met Allan over a Zoom call about a week ago. I have been following <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/">his blog</a> for some time and wanted to know more about his book draft about design patterns in Elixir. It wasn't until the call itself that I found out how many ideas we share - about the future of Elixir, its role as an alternative to present-day distributed solutions, and last but not least, its potential for the next generation of e-commerce solutions. </em></p><h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2><p><strong>Allan:</strong> I'm a software engineer with 15 years of experience, based in Toronto, Ontario. I was born and grew up in Mexico, and over the last 11 years, I have been able to build a career and life in Canada.</p><p>Most of my professional career has been focused on e-commerce development, which I would say can be broken down into three main categories:</p><ul><li>Building user-facing experiences</li><li>Building e-commerce engines to map the business logic</li><li>Integrations with third-party systems</li></ul><p>Over ten years of e-commerce development, I had the opportunity to work with many notable brands in Canada and the US and solve many challenges in the space. I have also dabbled working with product companies in multiple capacities - from CTO to currently a Senior Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.humi.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humi</a>.</p><p>In terms of technologies, I have had a chance to work with many different stacks and programming languages, notably PHP (LAMP), some Ruby on Rails, some Scala during my time at Hopper, and a bit of Elixir to tackle quick prototypes and transparent proxy for an e-commerce project.</p><p>Currently, I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Humi, a great company in the HR and payroll space. I am also building a couple of micro-SaaS projects - the first one being <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGuardian</a>, intended to be a complete solution for website monitoring and security. It should be close to beta release later this month.</p><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Allan: </strong>I stumbled into Elixir in a bit of a weird way, going back to one of the problems that I mentioned on the e-commerce space — integration with third-party systems like ERP, OMS, and the like, — for that kind of problems, the idea of <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/index.html">Flow-based programming</a> made a lot of sense.</p><p>In essence, you structure your application to be a pipeline of black boxes that transform, filter, or handle the data in some way or another. Looking for implementations of this library, I landed on a library called <a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex">FlowEx</a>, which is written in Elixir. As I started diving deeper into the language, I honestly fell in love with it.</p><p>Elixir to me seems like this almost perfect mix of all the right qualities:</p><ul><li>Flexibility and power</li><li>Low Learning curve</li><li>Extensibility</li><li>Expressiveness</li></ul><p>If I had to pinpoint any particular quality of Elixir that caught my attention, it would be the expressiveness of the language - how much you can achieve with very little code.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For me, the biggest challenge was adapting to a new paradigm and getting rid of the "bad" habits I picked up from working with Object-Oriented Languages. It is not the syntax that is different, but how you reason and think about the data flows in your program.</p><p>I guess the other challenging bit, which seems fairly common, was grasping the use of the Enum variable, Map, reduce, and the like. But once those things click, you are off to the races.</p><p>The other challenge that is still somewhat applicable is getting buying for the business or clients to use Elixir as a solution; however, I'm happy to see that it is gaining popularity and is being adopted by larger companies and teams.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>First, it is important to clarify what this next generation of e-commerce solutions looks like. We are currently in transition from the traditional catalog/search &gt; product page &gt; shopping cart &gt; checkout experience; and moving into a stage where e-commerce becomes ubiquitous, for example, integrated into an Instagram post or inside content.</p><p>This kind of change will present a couple of interesting challenges, both in terms of scalability / performance and architectures. The current generation of e-commerce platforms is fairly monolithic, or in the case of some of the SaaS offerings, fairly restrictive.</p><p>I can see an interesting future for Elixir and similar technologies to be used to develop the next generation e-commerce platforms and services; this is especially applicable when talking about integrations between OMS, Inventory systems, and Product Information Management systems.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>Absolutely! Right now, I'm working on a small SaaS project called <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/">SiteGuardian</a>, which aims to provide a robust solution for website site security and availability monitoring.</p><p>I chose Elixir for this project because first, I wanted to validate some architectural ideas and patterns that I'm researching for a book; and second, the Elixir stack allows me to build robust features and do so very efficiently.</p><p>To me, it is that perfect combination of development speed, robustness, and low operating costs that enables me to build a competitive micro-SaaS. Not to mention that my ability to iterate and build in this stack has been incredible compared to if was doing this in Laravel, or Ruby on Rails.</p><p>The second thing that I have in progress right now is a book on Elixir and design patterns. The idea is to explore and do a deep dive into the multiple variations of architectural and behavioral patterns that are relevant to functional programming and Elixir.</p><p>For anyone interested in the progress of the book, you can subscribe to my newsletter here: <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/">https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/</a></p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For people considering using Elixir / Erlang, my word of advice is to give things time to sink in. Functional programming is likely to be a new idea and paradigm and might take a while to grok the concepts, but once you do, the time invested is going to pay off ten-fold.</p><hr><h2 id="references">References</h2><figure><a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/"><div><p>Hi, I’m Allan, this is where I write. - Allan MacGregor</p><p>Expert Software Engineer and Manager • Writer • Functional Programming Advocate</p><p><span>Allan MacGregor</span></p></div><p><img src="https://allanmacgregor.com/static/logo-white-3bbb2d0ba72789f13cdee16471616911.png"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex"><div><p>antonmi/flowex</p><p>Flow-Based Programming framework for Elixir.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he year was 2003, and the first human genome had been <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" target="_blank">sequenced</a>.</p>
<p>By almost every metric, it was an extraordinary achievement. The completion of the Human Genome Project provided a starting point for scientists to study the “<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/" target="_blank">blueprint for building a person</a>”. Pharmaceutical companies suddenly possessed a genetic chart to design more targeted medicines. Archaeologists gained a roadmap to compare human genomes through the ages. Biologists acquired a lodestar to locate the genes governing health and behavior. The floodgates of the genomic era had officially opened. But the project also revealed a mystery.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, scientists <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/5yrplan/index.shtml" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the Human Genome Project would unveil 100,000 human genes. But the sequencing results revealed a stark reality: humans only have 20,000 genes—<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118530" target="_blank">10,000 fewer than a water flea</a>. It seems remarkable that humans—with our fancy bipedalism and oversized brains—could have fewer genes than a microscopic crustacean.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the two decades since the Human Genome Project. The technology to sequence genes has gotten cheaper and faster. The first human genome sequence cost three billion dollars, involved thousands of scientists, and took 13 years to complete. Today, sequencing machines can read a human genome in less than a day for a few hundred dollars. But technology is not a substitute for knowledge, and scientists still don’t fully understand how the genome works.</p>

<p>Nestled in the back corner of the <a href="https://broadfoundation.org/grantees/the-broad-center-for-biological-science-at-caltech/" target="_blank">Broad Center for the Biological Sciences</a> at Caltech, our research laboratory aims to understand how genomes encode and express information. To find us on campus, look for the cubic building made from metal and travertine, with sweeping views of the San Gabriel mountains. On a clear day many months ago, before the pandemic confined us to untidy apartments, we could see Mt. Wilson Observatory from our offices. Its white telescopes dot the mountain’s summit, silhouetted against the rising sun. Inside the lab, our benches are cluttered with liquid-filled bottles and metal pipettes.</p>
<p>We study genomes, in part, because of the impact on our impressionable young minds when the Human Genome Project made national news back in 2003. The structure of DNA had been <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/" target="_blank">established</a> fifty years earlier, thanks to herculean efforts from Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and others. Our understanding of genomes came a long way in those 50 years, from structure to sequence. But we know that there is more to learn.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/01/09/illumina-promises-to-sequence-human-genome-for-100-but-not-quite-yet/#14098b8f386d" target="_blank">500,000 human genomes</a> have been sequenced since 2003. Sequencing machines are now commonplace at universities. Humming on tables, they look like space-age computer systems, with touch screens and tiny, pneumatic tubes. DNA is extracted from living cells, trillions of copies are made using a technique called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matsiHSuoOw&amp;vl=en" target="_blank">PCR</a>, and the copied molecules are loaded (carefully!) into the machine. A few hours later, after the humming subsides, an interminable string of characters appears on the screen, made up of four letters: A, T, C, and G.</p>
<p>All genomes on earth are made up of these letters, called nucleotides. Each letter is a unique molecule—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—that links up to the others, forming a minimal alphabet. With these four letters, our cells construct words, or—in the context of biology—genes.</p>
<p>Much as a Xerox machine can make thousands of copies from a single document, genes are converted to messenger RNA in a process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whV_CkKT7F0" target="_blank">transcription</a>, which then serves as a template to build proteins. The human genome encodes about 20,000 genes, which in turn produce proteins that fend off viral invaders, manage blood sugar levels, and everything in between.</p>
<iframe width="280" height="156" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M198uHJd_8?start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This short animation shows how transcription happens.</p>

<p>But we cannot “see” these dynamic changes with a DNA sequence. The order of letters in a genome tells us nothing about how a gene is controlled in the molecular confines of a cell. Gene expression is dynamic and changing. Genes are turned on and off as proteins are needed, and these changes over time may explain how genomes can give rise to the most beautiful of lifeforms. In other words, it may explain how we are human, despite a trifling 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>We study how genomes are controlled because we want to understand ourselves. In doing so, we are building upon more than 80 years of experimental history.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1940s, Jacques Monod and François Jacob, frantically working in a little laboratory in the Necker neighborhood of Paris, found that cells control protein numbers by turning genes “on” or “off”. Though their results seem obvious today (the best results always do), they shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1965/summary/" target="_blank">1965 Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine for their work.</p>
<p>Genes are regulated by proteins called transcription factors, of which there are two types: activators, which bind to DNA near the start of a gene and increase the amount of mRNA copies made from a gene, much like loading more paper into a Xerox tray, and repressors, which decrease the amount of mRNA copies. Transcription factors hold dominion over the genome, controlling when each gene gets to make its Xerox copies.</p>
<p>Jacob and Monod’s findings provided a potential solution to the question that arose from the first human genome sequence, 60 years later. Perhaps an organism’s complexity is dictated not by how many genes are present in a genome, but rather by how those genomes are controlled, over time, by transcription factors.
To build upon the work of our scientific heroes, our lab at Caltech wanted to determine which type of transcription factor—activator or repressor—regulates each and every gene. To test our experiments, we decided to start with a small genome. We turned to a bacterium, <em>Escherichia coli</em>.</p>
<p>In the grand order of nature, <em>E. coli</em> is relatively simple, containing 4,000 genes and 200 transcription factors. But, despite its meager size, we still do not know how two-thirds of its genes are regulated.</p>

<p>The <i>E. coli</i> genome contains about 4.6 million nucleotides and 4,000 genes. In this diagram, genes that have known regulation (which means that we know which transcription factors regulate them) are marked in blue. For most genes (roughly two-thirds), we have no idea which transcription factors regulate or control them (marked in red).</p>

<p>We knew that if we ever wanted to understand how even a small bacterial genome is regulated, a new experimental method would be needed. So we <i>created</i> one.</p>
<hr>
<p>When <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/theriotlab/members/" target="_blank">Nathan Belliveau</a> joined the lab, a few years ago, his objective was simple: find an easy way to determine how genes in <em>E. coli</em> are regulated.</p>
<p>Sitting at the bench, he harvested genetic material from <em>E. coli</em> and loaded the DNA into a sequencer. After a few years—and hundreds of trials—he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4796" target="_blank">reported</a> the foundations of a radical method that would eventually enable our laboratory to figure out which transcription factors regulate hundreds, or thousands, of genes at a time. Nathan left the group in 2017, PhD in hand, and flew to colder climates. Bill Ireland and Suzy Beeler (an author of this article) took over the project.</p>
<p>They, too, spent years agonizing over the method. After using thousands of tubes of DNA and covering their benches in teetering stacks of bacteria-streaked agar plates, Bill and Suzy managed to extend Nathan’s findings to more than a hundred genes. In the process, they refined a powerful method that lends deep insights into the intricate, molecular machines that regulate genomes.</p>
<p>Here’s how the method works.</p>
<p>We begin by literally mail ordering short sequences of DNA—the regions immediately in front of a gene—where transcription factors typically bind. A computer helps us design mutated versions of each DNA sequence, randomly changing the letters until we have thousands of variants for each sequence. A company in San Francisco takes our digital letters, creates physical copies, and ships them in a little plastic tube to our laboratory. We then place these synthetic pieces of DNA inside of <em>E. coli</em> cells, and use a modified version of DNA sequencing to determine whether each “letter” change made a gene produce more or fewer Xerox copies.</p>
<p>If a DNA sequence produces very little RNA inside of the cell, this suggests that the letter change (or mutation) blocked transcription; it choked up the Xerox machine. It also indicates that an activator was probably binding to that DNA sequence, and the mutation prevented it from doing its job. Some mutations, however, increase the amount of RNA produced from a DNA sequence, suggesting that the mutation is preventing a repressor from binding.</p>
<p>By analyzing this data and running it through mathematical models, we can determine whether each gene is regulated by an activator or repressor, how many transcription factors regulate each gene, and where those transcription factors actually bind.</p>
<p>In other words, we can map the genome’s regulatory networks.</p>

<p>After performing this experiment on more than one hundred genes, we made some startling discoveries. In one case, we found a transcription factor with dual activity: it activated the transcription of one gene while repressing the transcription of another. We also identified transcription factors that are only active in certain environments; when <em>E. coli</em> is grown in the presence of a sugar, for example, a transcription factor called GlpR represses a handful of genes. Without the sugar, GlpR doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55308" target="_blank">study</a> marks a major advancement in genomic research. But it didn’t come for free.</p>
<p>Throughout the last five years, we have failed repeatedly. We have mislabeled tubes and used ethanol instead of water to dilute DNA. We have dropped flasks, shattering glass and spilling bacteria on the floor. We have been frustrated, again and again. But we continued on, inching closer …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>P</span>rogrammers normally want to minimize the time their code takes to execute. But in 1962, the Hungarian mathematician Tibor RadÃ³ posed the opposite problem. He asked: How long can a simple computer program possibly run before it terminates? RadÃ³ nicknamed these maximally inefficient but still functional programs â€œbusy beavers.â€�</p>

<p>Finding these programs has been a fiendishly diverting puzzle for programmers and other mathematical hobbyists ever since it was popularized in Scientific Americanâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computer-recreations-1984-08/" target="_blank">â€œComputer Recreationsâ€� column</a>&nbsp;in 1984. But in the last several years, the busy beaver game, as itâ€™s known, has become an object of study in its own right, because it has yielded connections to some of the loftiest concepts and open problems in mathematics.</p>
<p>â€œIn math, there is a very permeable boundary between whatâ€™s an amusing recreation and what is actually important,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson" target="_blank">Scott Aaronson</a>, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin who published a&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3427361.3427369" target="_blank">survey</a>&nbsp;of progress in â€œBusyBeaverology.â€�<br></p>
<p>The recent work suggests that the search for long-running computer programs can illuminate the state of mathematical knowledge, and even tell us whatâ€™s knowable. According to researchers, the busy beaver game provides a concrete benchmark for evaluating the difficulty of certain problems, such as the unsolved Goldbach conjecture and Riemann hypothesis. It even offers a glimpse of where the logical bedrock underlying math breaks down. The logician Kurt GÃ¶del proved the existence of such mathematical terra incognita nearly a century ago. But the busy beaver game can show where it actually lies on a number line, like an ancient map depicting the edge of the world.</p><p><strong>An Uncomputable Computer Game</strong></p>
<p>The busy beaver game is all about the behavior of Turing machines—the primitive, idealized computers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" target="_blank">conceived by Alan Turing in 1936</a>. A Turing machine performs actions on an endless strip of tape divided into squares. It does so according to a list of rules. The first rule might say:</p>
<blockquote>If the square contains a 0, replace it with a 1, move one square to the right and consult rule 2. If the square contains a 1, leave the 1, move one square to the left and consult rule 3.</blockquote>
<p>Each rule has this forking choose-your-own-adventure style. Some rules say to jump back to previous rules; eventually thereâ€™s a rule containing an instruction to â€œhalt.â€� Turing proved that this simple kind of computer is capable of performing any possible calculation, given the right instructions and enough time.</p>
<p>As Turing noted in 1936, in order to compute something, a Turing machine must eventually halt—it canâ€™t get trapped in an infinite loop. But he also proved that thereâ€™s no reliable, repeatable method for distinguishing machines that halt from machines that simply run forever—a fact known as the halting problem.</p>
<p>The busy beaver game asks: Given a certain number of rules, whatâ€™s the maximum number of steps that a Turing machine can take before halting?</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_448ca98db9d7b1349758c6545cdf7237.jpg" alt="nautilus tibor rado"><figcaption><span>Tibor RadÃ³, shown here in an undated photo, invented the busy beaver game as a way of making the theoretical notion of uncomputability concrete. </span><br><span>Courtesy of The Ohio State University Archives</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, if youâ€™re only allowed one rule, and you want to ensure that the Turing machine halts, youâ€™re forced to include the halt instruction right away. The busy beaver number of a one-rule machine, or BB(1), is therefore 1.</p>
<p>But adding just a few more rules instantly blows up the number of machines to consider. Of 6,561 possible machines with two rules, the one that runs the longest—six steps—before halting is the busy beaver. But some others simply run forever. None of these are the busy beaver, but how do you definitively rule them out? Turing proved that thereâ€™s no way to automatically tell whether a machine that runs for a thousand or a million steps wonâ€™t eventually terminate.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why finding busy beavers is so hard. Thereâ€™s no general approach for identifying the longest-running Turing machines with an arbitrary number of instructions; you have to puzzle out the specifics of each case on its own. In other words, the busy beaver game is, in general, â€œuncomputable.â€�</p>
<p>Proving that BB(2) = 6 and that BB(3) = 107 was difficult enough that RadÃ³â€™s student Shen Lin earned a doctorate for the work in 1965. RadÃ³ considered BB(4) â€œentirely hopeless,â€� but&nbsp;the case was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1983-40-162/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6.pdf" target="_blank">finally solved in 1983</a>. Beyond that, the values virtually explode; researchers have identified a five-rule Turing machine, for instance, that runs for 47,176,870 steps before stopping, so BB(5) is at least that big. BB(6) is at least 7.4 Ã— 1036,534.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving the exact values â€œwill need new ideas and new insights, if it can be done at all,â€� said Aaronson.</p>
<p><strong>Threshold of Unknowability</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/" target="_blank">William Gasarch</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park, said heâ€™s less intrigued by the prospect of pinning down busy beaver numbers than by â€œthe general concept that itâ€™s actually uncomputable.â€� He and other mathematicians are mainly interested in using the game as a yardstick for gauging the difficulty of important open problems in mathematics—or for figuring out what is mathematically knowable at all.</p>
<p>The Goldbach conjecture, for instance, asks whether every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Proving the conjecture true or false would be an epochal event in number theory, allowing mathematicians to better understand the distribution of prime numbers. In 2015, an anonymous GitHub user named Code Golf Addict&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6" target="_blank">published code</a>&nbsp;for a 27-rule Turing machine that halts if—and only if—the Goldbach conjecture is false. It works by counting upward through all even integers greater than 4; for each one, it grinds through all the possible ways to get that integer by adding two others, checking whether the pair is prime. When it finds a suitable pair of primes, it moves up to the next even integer and repeats the process. If it finds an even integer that canâ€™t be summed by a pair of prime numbers, it halts.</p>
<p>Running this mindless machine isnâ€™t a practical way to solve the conjecture, because we canâ€™t know if it will ever halt until it does. But the busy beaver game sheds some light on the problem. If it were possible to compute BB(27), that would provide a ceiling on how long weâ€™d have to wait for the Goldbach conjecture to be settled automatically. Thatâ€™s because BB(27) corresponds to the maximum number of steps this 27-rule Turing machine would have to execute in order to halt (if it ever did). If we knew that number, we could run the Turing machine for exactly that many steps. If it halted by that point, weâ€™d know the Goldbach conjecture was false. But if it went that many steps and didnâ€™t halt, weâ€™d know for certain that it never would—thus proving the conjecture true.</p>
<p>The rub is that BB(27) is such an incomprehensibly huge number that even writing it down, much less running the Goldbach-falsifying machine for that many steps, isnâ€™t remotely possible in our physical universe. Nevertheless, that incomprehensibly huge number is still an exact figure whose magnitude, according to Aaronson, represents â€œa statement about our current knowledgeâ€� of number theory.</p>
<p>In 2016, Aaronson established a similar result in collaboration with Yuri Matiyasevich and Stefan Oâ€™Rear. They identified a 744-rule Turing machine that halts if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is false. The Riemann hypothesis also concerns the distribution of prime numbers and is one of the Clay Mathematics Instituteâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/riemann-hypothesis" target="_blank">â€œMillennium Problemsâ€�</a>&nbsp;worth $1 million. Aaronsonâ€™s machine will deliver an automatic solution in BB(744) steps. (It works by essentially the same mindless process as the Goldbach machine, iterating upward until it finds a counterexample.)</p>
<p>Of course, BB(744) is an even more unattainably large number than BB(27). But working to pin down something easier, like BB(5), â€œmay actually turn up some new number theory questions that are interesting in their own right,â€� Aaronson said. For instance, the mathematician Pascal Michel&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409968" target="_blank">proved</a>&nbsp;in 1993 that the record-holding five-rule Turing machine exhibits behavior similar to that of the function described in the Collatz conjecture, another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/" target="_blank">famous open problem</a>&nbsp;in number theory.</p>
<p>â€œSo much of math can be encoded as a question of, â€˜Does this Turing machine halt or not?â€™â€� Aaronson said. â€œIf you knew all the busy beaver numbers, then you could settle all of those questions.â€�</p>
<p>More recently, Aaronson has used a busy-beaver-derived yardstick to gauge what he calls â€œthe threshold of unknowabilityâ€� for entire systems of mathematics. GÃ¶delâ€™s famous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-incompleteness-theorems-work-20200714/" target="_blank">incompleteness theorems</a>&nbsp;of 1931 proved that any set of basic axioms that could serve as a possible logical foundation for mathematics is doomed to one of two fates: Either the axioms will be inconsistent, leading to contradictions (like proving that 0 = 1), or theyâ€™ll be incomplete, unable to prove some true statements about numbers (like the fact that 2 + 2 = 4). The axiomatic system underpinning almost all modern math, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, has its own GÃ¶delian boundaries—and Aaronson wanted to use the busy beaver game to establish where they are.</p>
<p>In 2016, he and his graduate student Adam Yedidia specified a 7,910-rule Turing machine that would only halt if ZF set theory is inconsistent. This means BB(7,910) is a calculation that eludes the axioms of ZF set theory. Those axioms canâ€™t be used to prove that BB(7,910) represents one number instead of another, which is like not being able to prove that 2 + 2 = 4 instead of 5.</p>
<p>Oâ€™Rear subsequently devised a much simpler 748-rule machine that halts if ZF is inconsistent—essentially moving the threshold of unknowability closer, from BB(7,910) to BB(748). â€œThat is a kind of a dramatic thing, that the number [of rules] is not completely ridiculous,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://math.osu.edu/people/friedman.8" target="_blank">Harvey Friedman</a>, a mathematical …</p></article></div>

So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>While I'm away on my honeymoon, here's my complete talk from PAX Australia 2019, on the rise and fall of legendary shareware publisher Ambrosia Software.</p><p>For Mac gamers in the 90s, the people of Ambrosia Software were rockstars. Heroes. And with brilliant games like Maelstrom, Escape Velocity, Harry the Handsome Executive, Apeiron, and more, plus a company newsletter that spoke directly to the fans, they could do no wrong. In light of Ambrosia's recent closure (finally!), Secret History of Mac Gaming author Richard Moss recounts the studio's high and lowpoints and tells the stories behind its best games.</p><p>Thanks as always to my supporters on Patreon — especially my $10+ backers Vivek Mohan, Simon Moss, Wade Tregaskis, Eric Zocher, and Seth Robinson.

But to tide you by until I'm back, I thought you might enjoy listening to my talk from PAX Australia 2019 about the lesser-known of the indie game publishing giants from before the time of Braid and Steam and all that other stuff we've had over the past 15 years.</p><p>The talk was called The Rise &amp; Fall of Ambrosia Software, '90s Mac Legends, and you can find accompanying slides at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk</a> as well as my full script on the accompanying blog post at lifeandtimes.games. So please, enjoy, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p><div><p><em>[note that this won't correspond exactly to the audio, as it was my written script rather than what I actually said. If you're looking at the slides, "[NEXT]" means go to the next slide.]]<br></em><br>Hello everyone. My name is Richard Moss, and today I'm going to talk to you about a company that's pretty near and dear to my heart, not only as someone who grew up playing some of their games — [NEXT] but also as the author of a book called The Secret History of Mac Gaming, which covers their history, along with lots of other games and game developers from the 1980s and 90s Mac gaming scene. [NEXT]</p><p>If you were a Mac gamer in the late 90s, chances are pretty high that you would have had at least one game in your collection that came from Ambrosia Software. [NEXT] They were heroes among the Macintosh faithful, one of only a few companies that made its games exclusive to the Mac. And arguably the best among them in terms of the quality of its output.</p><p>Games like [NEXT] Maelstrom, [NEXT] Escape Velocity, [NEXT] Ferazel's Wand, [NEXT] Apeiron, and [NEXT] Bubble Trouble were hallmarks of quality, even if most of them were essentially just jazzed-up versions of classic 80s games. And they had top-drawer offbeat gaming options, too, with titles like [NEXT] Avara, a kinda abstract-looking arena-style first-person shooter, and [NEXT] Harry the Handsome Executive, where you guide a middle management executive through an office electronics apocalypse while scooting around in a swivel chair.</p><p>For about 15 years or so, from 1993 to around 2008, the Ambrosia Software name was inseparable from quality Macintosh games. But then it faded rapidly into the background, for reasons I'll get to later, and finally the company closed its doors at the end of last year.</p><p>***</p><p>So in recognition of Ambrosia's achievements, which have slipped a bit under the radar outside of the old-school Mac faithful, I wanted to give you a tour through the company's rise and fall. </p><p>There's not enough time to cover everything, but I'll try to get to all the key stuff and you'll hopefully come away with a good sense of a) why Ambrosia Software matters to the history of computer games and b) what made Ambrosia special to the Macintosh flock. </p><p>I've got some interview clips, a bit of gameplay footage, some photos and old documents to help us along the way. I wanted to set up an emulator as well but just ran out of time unfortunately. And hopefully there'll be plenty of time at the end for questions and stories from you in the audience.</p><p>But before we go into rise and fall of Ambrosia, let's do some quick background. First, on Ambrosia founder Andrew Welch. Then second on the Mac gaming scene in the early 90s.</p><p>[NEXT] So, Andrew Welch. His dad owned a marketing company, and it was through that business that young Andrew planted the seed for what would become Ambrosia. When he was something like 12 or 13 years old, he found the company's library of books and documents on typography. He thought it was cool, so he learnt how to design his own typefaces on his Macintosh. Then, starting from age 14 or so, he sold them on America OnLine.</p><p>But most people doing this sold their fonts without any documentation at all, so there was no way to know after the fact who made it, how to pay for it, who to contact for support, and so on. So Andrew taught himself how to code a utility program that could wrap his fonts in a simple document reader thing.</p><p>He enjoyed coding so much that he kept doing it, and made various other utilities for his relatives. Then he went off to college to study photojournalism and in his spare time he created [NEXT] his first game, a Wheel of Fortune clone called Wacky Wheel.</p><p>[NEXT] [show it in action]</p><p>This was kind of par for the course with small Mac games at the time. There were lots of people putting out crappy little games as freeware or shareware, but even the rare good ones weren't really making anything more than pizza and beer money.</p><p>[NEXT] Or literally beer.</p><p>Quick definition of shareware: [NEXT] it's software that you give away, free, but you ask that if someone likes it they pay you a registration fee — which, depending on the exact implementation, might get that person customer support or free updates or maybe just remove the nag screen from the boot-up process.</p><p>[NEXT] This is a pretty typical shareware notice, taken from an early DOS game.</p><p>Over on the PC side, shareware had already taken off. [NEXT] Apogee Software and Epic MegaGames were making a fortune working with independent developers and selling their games in a clever twist of the standard shareware model called The Apogee Model. Instead of giving away the whole thing for free and requesting that people pay if they like it, Apogee and Epic's games were [NEXT] episodic — episode one distributed freely over the internet and BBSs and through mail-order floppy disks, and all subsequent episodes available to order for a set fee.</p><p>I'm actually writing a book about this stuff, so if you're curious to learn more ask me about it later.</p><p>And id Software were just starting to make their name at this point as well. [NEXT] Wolfenstein 3D dropped in 92, then [NEXT] Doom in 93, both published as shareware on PC through Apogee. </p><p>So the time was ripe for shareware to step up and hit the big time on the Mac side, too. The Mac was at the peak of its [NEXT] pre-iMac popularity. College kids across the United States had Macs set up in their dorm rooms, while creative professionals all around the world had taken up the Mac mantle and were keen for more time-wasters to get them through the lulls in their output.</p><p>But there weren't many games coming out — the porting industry, which took PC games and put them on Mac, was still in its infancy after struggling with the [NEXT] peculiarities of adapting games for the Mac's multi-window mouse and menu-driven interface. Truly cross-platform commercial computer games that had concurrent Mac and PC releases were still rare (though there were a few special ones like [NEXT] SimCity 2000), and Mac-first development had gone into a bit of a lull (for a variety of reasons) at the end of the 1980s — from which it had yet to fully recover.</p><p>So there was lots of room for a great new Mac-native game to stand out.</p><p>And, crucially for our story here, someone was wrong on the Internet. I'll let you hear this bit straight from Andrew: [NEXT]</p><p><em>AW: I think it was the summer after maybe my freshman year of college that someone had said — I think it was called the Mac IIci or something like that. It was one of the colour Macs that came out. And someone had said something about the fact that while it was too slow to do decent animation on — and by that point in time I had actually taught myself for Assembly language, as well. So I set out to prove this guy wrong, because it's always fun to try to prove someone on the Internet that they're wrong. <p>*laughs* So, yeah, so that's how I started writing — and I really wasn't sure what I was going to do yet — but I started writing some kind of animation stuff. I grew up going to a lot of the arcades where we played games like Asteroids and Centipede and that type of thing where after school I would get dropped off there and play. So I decided to make an Asteroids-based game.</p></em></p><p>[NEXT]<br>He asked a couple of friends to help him out with the graphics, and got together with a few of his college buddies and a microphone to make a bunch of silly noises and record stuff off the TV for sound effects.</p><p>They pulled liberally from pop culture, drawing tiny clips and references (without permission) from all over the place, kind of like the wall of sound that early hip-hop and remix culture had.[NEXT]</p><p>He called the game Maelstrom and put it online as shareware, published under the name Ambrosia Software — a name he pulled from Greek mythology. You could play it and share it freely, but it'd nag you to send in a cheque to register every time you booted the game. And a lot of people did. [NEXT]</p><p><em>everyday we would go to the mailbox and there'd be letters from all over the world. I just had a blast. I thought it was really really cool that I could do something just sitting in my room in upstate New York, which was where I was at the time. And I got these contacts from all over the world. I thought that was really really cool, and it was at a time where people were just starting to get connected online.<p>Like now it's no big deal — you can go on …</p></em></p></div></div>

<p>This is the second part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, III, IV) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> / <em>Game of Thrones</em> series.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  Our last part, “<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">Barbarian Couture</a>” looked at the influences that shaped the visual depiction of the Dothraki and found them badly wanting, more based in stereotypes and misconceptions than historical reality.</p>



<p>This week, we’re turning to the foundation of social structures: <strong>patterns of subsistence</strong> (<strong>which, to be clear, means in plain English: “how do they get food and basic resources?” </strong> That’s all subsistence is – how do you get enough resources to survive.)  Originally this was going to fit into a larger argument about culture, but I decided to break it out because we are <em>at long last</em> looking at the logistics and subsistence strategies of nomadic peoples.  Every time we have covered the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/">logistics </a>of <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">agrarian </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/10/04/collections-the-preposterous-logistics-of-the-loot-train-battle-game-of-thrones-s7e4/">armies </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">societies</a>, there has been a request to do a deeper dive into the way that Steppe nomads in particular, and nomads more generally, are different.  <strong>Well here it is!</strong></p>

<p>(Bibliography note before we dive in.  I am not going to run through everything I’ve glanced at here, but for those looking to read more on this or retrace my steps more generally, a good starting place on the Steppe peoples is T. May, <em>The Mongol Art of War</em> (2007).  There’s also more than a dash here of bits from K. Chase, <em>Firearms: A Global History to 1700</em> (2008) as well as T. Ratchnevsky, <em>Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy</em>, trans. T.N Haining (1991).  For the Native Americans of the Great Plains, I have relied principally on A.R. McGinnis, <em>Counting Coup and Cutting Horses: Intertribal Warfare on the Northern Plains, 1738-1889</em> (1990), F.R. Secoy, <em>Changing Military Patterns of the Great Plains Indians (17th Century through Early 19th Century)</em> (1958), and A.C. Isenberg, <em>The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920</em> (2020))</p>



<p><strong>As with the past essay, the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).  Last time, we found that the <em>appearance</em> of the Dothraki fit almost entirely within the ‘dash’ of fantasy.  So this time we will begin to ask the same question about Dothraki culture –<strong> to what degree may it be said to be based in any <em>actual</em> historical horse-nomad cultures?</strong></p>



<h2>A Feast For People</h2>



<p>Now ‘culture’ is such a huge topic, it may well be asked why start with subsistence strategies. <strong> The answer is that in the pre-modern world, subsistence was one of, if not the, most dominant factor shaping culture</strong>.  After all, most people before the industrial revolution spent most of their time just doing the basic activities (herding, farming, spinning, weaving, cooking, etc.) that made survival possible!  Government structures, military organization, cultural values, marriage and fertility patterns, social structures all flow out of those things which most people were doing to survive, shaped by the needs of those subsistence strategies.</p>



<p>(A brief pedantic note: this sort of approach to history, beginning with big, slow changing patterns (what I often call here ‘structures’ – not a term I made up, by any means) like climate, geography, subsistence strategies, culture, etc. is generally associated with what is called the <em>Annales</em> school of history, which is a <em>method</em> of history.  This framework is often more interested in <em>La longue durée</em> (lit: ‘the (really) long term’) which is just a fancy French way of saying ‘a focus on the long-term historical structures (like those listed above) instead of short-term events (like wars, rulers, that sort of thing).’  As always, this sort of historical theory is a toolbox, not a dogma; different approaches to answer different questions.  But in this case, it is handy because of the way that the basic activities necessary for survival in a given climate form a sort of ‘bounding box’ for cultural possibility.)</p>



<p>What is particularly notable is with <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that our viewpoint character for Dothraki culture is a young woman who spends her time with the Dothraki in the <em>khalassar’s</em> (the Dothraki word for a tribe or clan) moving encampment.  Daenerys can only really view warfare second hand (at least in the books we get; the show is another matter), <strong>but she ought to be able to witnesses the subsistence system directly</strong>.  Even if she wasn’t involved in it directly (because she’s a high status queen), the daily work of survival would be going on all around her and in practice much of it would likely be at her direction as she exercises authority over lower-status individuals in the camp.</p>



<p>Now normally we would start this by looking at how subsistence strategies are represented in the books and show, but I think in this case it is going to be more helpful to begin with the historical subsistence systems <em>first</em>, since they are complex and we’re going to have several of them.  We’re actually going to start at the ending as well, with subsistence strategies of Native Americans on the Great Plains, for reasons that will be clearer once we’ve discussed it.</p>



<h2>A Changing of Patterns</h2>



<p><strong>The domesticated horse is not native to the Americas</strong>.  There is perhaps no more important fact when trying to understand how the horse-borne nomadic cultures of the Eurasian Steppe relate to those of the Great Plains.  The first domesticated horses arrived in the Americans with European explorer/conquerors and the settler-colonists that followed them.  Eventually enough of those horses escaped to create a self-reproducing wild (technically feral, since they were once domesticated) horse population, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang">mustangs</a>, but they are not indigenous and mustangs were never really the primary source of new horses the way that wild horses on the Steppe were (before someone goes full nerd in the comments, yes I am aware that there were some early equines in the Americas at very early dates, but they were extinct before there was any chance for them to be domesticated).</p>

Mustangs are descendants mostly of Spanish horse breeds.  Notably, they tend to be smaller than many other breeds of European horses, even in cases where their domesticated forebears were larger breeds of draft horses or destriers.  This is because big stable-fed horses can’t survive on grass alone.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Horses arrived in the Great Plains form the south via the Spanish and moving through Native American peoples west of the Rocky Mountains by both trade and eventually raiding in the early 1700s</strong>.  Notably firearms <em>also</em> began moving into the region in the same period, but from the opposite direction, coming from British and French traders to the North and West (the Spanish had regulations against trading firearms to Native Americans, making them unavailable as a source).  Both were thus initially <em>expensive trade goods</em> which could only be obtained from outside and then percolated unevenly through the territory; unlike firearms, which remained wholly external in their supply, horses were bred on the plains, but raiding and trade were still essential sources of supply for most peoples on the plains.  We’ll get to this more when we talk about warfare (where we’ll get into the four different military systems created by this diffusion), but being in a position where one’s neighbors had either the horse or the gun and your tribe did not was an <em>extreme</em> military disadvantage and it’s clear that the ‘falling out’ period whereby these two military innovations distributed over the area was very disruptive.</p>



<p><strong>But unlike guns</strong>, which seem to have had massive military impacts but only minimal subsistence impacts (a bow being just as good for hunting bison as a musket, generally), <strong>the arrival of the horse had <em>massive</em> subsistence impacts</strong> because it made hunting <em>wildly</em> more effective.  But the key thing to remember here is: the horse was <em>introduced</em> to the Great Plains no earlier than 1700, horse availability expanded only slowly over the area, but by 1877 (with the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_War_of_1876">Black Hills War</a>), true Native American independence on the Great Plains was functionally over.  <strong>Consequently, unlike the Steppe, where we have a fairly ‘set’ system that had already been refined for centuries, <em>all</em> we see of the Plains Native American horse-based subsistence system is rapid change</strong>.  There was no finally reached stable end state, as far as I can tell.</p>



<p>Though there is considerable variation and also severe limits to the evidence, it seems that prior to the arrival of the horse, most Native peoples around the Great Plains practiced two major subsistence systems: <strong>nomadic hunter-gathering on foot </strong>(distinct from what will follow in that it places much more emphasis on the gathering part)<strong> on the one hand and a mixed subsistence system of small-scale farming mixed seasonally with plains hunting seems to have been the main options pre-horse</strong>, based on the degree to which the local area permitted farming in this way (for more on those, note Isenberg, <em>op. cit.</em>, 31-40).

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis. That’s changed thanks to Therapsil. A couple months ago, he became the first Canadian to legally use psychedelic mushrooms to treat end of life anxiety and depression. Take a listen to his story with an open mind.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:02:33</span></span></span><span><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/microdosing-pschedelics-study-1.4771647" data-contentid="" flag="" text="How and why people 'microdose' tiny hits of psychedelic drugs"><span>How and why people 'microdose' tiny hits of psychedelic drugs</span></a></li></ul></span></p>  <p>The move comes after Health Canada&nbsp;gave <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/magic-mushrooms-therapy-1.5675637" target="_blank">four exemptions to palliative care patients</a> to use the drug&nbsp;for end-of-life psychotherapy in August. Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
