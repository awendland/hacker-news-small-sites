January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>
    <span>serverProperties</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>server-port</span> <span>=</span> <span>25565</span><span>;</span>
      <span>gamemode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"survival"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>motd</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NixOS Minecraft server on Tailscale!"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>max-players</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
      <span>enable-rcon</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue (for example from <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a>) is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. Either way, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and be bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
      </li>

        <p>Moderna has a proprietary molecule called Lipid SM-102.

<h3 id="creators-of-the-hippocratic-license-establish-a-nonprofit-to-empower-developers-to-use-their-technology-talents-for-social-good-and-to-prevent-harm">Creators of the Hippocratic License establish a nonprofit to empower developers to use their technology talents for social good and to prevent harm</h3>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, January 19, 2021 – The creator of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License</a>, an ethical license for open source, and <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for open source projects, today announced the establishment of a new nonprofit, the Organization for Ethical Source (OES).</p>

<p>Central to the philosophy of open source is the notion of software freedom, referred to as “Freedom Zero”: that open source software can be used for any purpose without restriction, <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">even for explicitly “evil” purposes</a>. The world has changed since the Open Source Definition was created — open source has become ubiquitous, and is now being leveraged by bad actors for mass surveillance, racist policing, and other human rights abuses all over the world. The OES believes that the open source community must evolve to address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.</p>

<p>Inspired by the work of Latinx and Chicanx activist organization <a href="https://twitter.com/conmijente">Mijente</a> and their #NoTechForICE campaign, the Ethical Source Movement <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/ethical-source-six-month-retrospective/">launched in October 2019</a>. Its first milestone was the March 2020 release of the Hippocratic License 2.1, an ethical open source license tied to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and developed in collaboration with a pro-bono legal team from partner organization <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>. The license has already been adopted by hundreds of open source projects including the Ruby library <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr/">VCR</a>, mobile app development tool <a href="https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon">Gryphon</a>, Javascript mapping library <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">react-leaflet</a>, and the entire open source portfolio of the <a href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/story/ethical-source-at-wetransfer">WeTransfer</a> corporation. But the most significant impact of the license may be the <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">debate it sparked</a> between ethical-minded developers and open source traditionalists around the primacy of “Freedom Zero.”</p>

<p>“For too long we’ve been comforting ourselves with the myth that technology is inherently neutral. But there is nothing neutral about police using facial recognition algorithms to target legitimate protestors, or algorithms that perpetuate bias and sexism and racism, or any other of the dozens of kinds of human rights abuses we see technology playing a part in today,” said Coraline Ada Ehmke, president and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source. “As technologists we have to accept that our work has an outsized impact on society, and that means we have an outsized responsibility to minimize the harm it can cause. The Organization for Ethical Source was founded to help technologists accept these responsibilities, and learn how to center justice and equity in the work we do. We are united in our conviction that software freedom must not come before human freedom.”</p>

<p>With a founding grant from the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, the Organization for Ethical Source is developing new programs that build on its initial work with the Hippocratic License — extending the reach of that effort while developing new tools and projects focusing on ethical governance, digital supply chain compliance, and other strategies. The organization’s leadership team includes founding members Coraline Ada Ehmke, Don Goodman-Wilson, and Tobie Langel. Elections for the Governing Committee are slated to take place in February 2021.</p>

<p>“There are so many ways that communities can come together today to tackle the tech industry’s biggest problems, and that is especially true about the open source community,” said Aniyia L. Williams, Principal, Responsible Technology, Omidyar Network. “We are excited to see the formation of the Organization for Ethical Source, and are thrilled to power the innovative, thoughtful, and courageous plans they have for creating accountability in building software.”</p>

<p>“Systemic change in the tech industry is long overdue, and the Organization for Ethical Source is a much-needed catalyst,” said Charity Ryerson, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability Lab. CAL is a nonprofit organization providing legal support to the new organization through developing ethical license offerings and providing free direct legal services to ethical license adopters. “We are excited to support this initiative, and hope to see tangible improvements for cobalt miners, Foxconn workers, immigrant detainees and others who have been harmed by Big Tech.”</p>

<p>The Organization for Ethical Source brings together open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, human rights workers, academics, and more to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into open source work. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Learn more about the Organization for Ethical Source</a>, or <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-organization-for-ethical-source">About the Organization for Ethical Source</h3>

<p>The movement to promote ethics and social responsibility in open source was founded in October 2019 by Coraline Ada Ehmke, and led to the establishment of the nonprofit Organization for Ethical Source under Swiss law in December 2020. The organization is dedicated to giving technologists tools and resources to ensure that their work is being used for social good and to minimize harm. It develops tools to promote fair, ethical, and pro-social outcomes for those who contribute to, or are affected by, open source technologies. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">https://ethicalsource.dev/</a></p>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

		<p>Real time, text communications are not the invention of email. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, long distance was expensive and fax very slow. Vulcan needed an alternate method to communicate in real time for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two offices needed written communications on production schedules and preparation of quotations. For example, the factory was required to send a periodic telex to inform the executive office of the status of every back order in the system.</li>
<li>Since a third of Vulcan’s sales volume was international, it needed to communicate rapidly with its customers, both during the sales process and to respond rapidly during breakdowns.</li>
<li>Its field service force needed a way to obtain quick answers, especially when in places like Southeast Asia where the time difference made voice telephone difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telex was the obvious answer. A more general description of the technology and its history is given below; here we will concentrate on Vulcan’s use of telex as a business tool.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://vulcanhammer.info/32asr/" data-orig-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif" data-orig-size="213,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="32asr" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" data-large-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" src="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=1040" alt="32asr">During the years the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcan-florida-executive-office/">Australian Avenue office</a> was in operation, both that office and the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcans-chattanooga-factory/">Chattanooga facility</a> possessed telex machines similar to the one shown on the right. These were basically electromechanical terminals using roll paper printed on by a cylindrical drum with the letters on it (typewriters with a ball printer used the same idea, but the results looked better.) On the left was the paper tape punch. For most telexes, one composed them recording the telex on the paper tape, which encoded the data with a system of punched holes, similar to a player piano roll. When the telex was sent, once the connection was made, the paper tape was played back to the receiving telex. In this way the message would not be hindered by slow typing with mistakes. It was also possible to leave the tape punch on to record receiving telexes as well for retransmission. (<em>A fictional enactment of using the telex–and the possible result–is found in the novel <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/633941">The Ten Weeks</a>.</em>)&nbsp; A telex machine similar to Vulcan’s is shown in action below.</p>

<p>Telex could also be used in a “dialogue” mode similar to instant messaging or IRC chat, but Vulcan seldom used it in this way. With this, the initiator of the dialogue could ring the bell at the recipient’s end to get their attention.</p>

All of the telexes here went to Belgium, so they were probably for the Vulcan’s business associate in Vilvorde, Nilens. Since they were around Christmastime, somebody hopefully put in a “Joyeux Noel” somewhere in there.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telexes were identified by the telex number and the answerback. In the example above, when Straits Engineers sent the “Who are you?” our machine responded with its answerback, VULCAN WPB. The sending machine then replied with its own before going into the message, generally adding its telex number as well. Thus, “STREL RS” was the sender’s answerback and “23644” was the telex number. (The “RS” identified the telex as from Singapore; this is the <a title="direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rfc1394.pdf">direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier</a>. The answerback is the key feature; it verifies to the sender that the recipient is actually receiving what’s sent. Once the recipient’s number is dialled, the cross (<a href="https://www.vulcanhammer.org/what-is-the-gospel/">the usual sign of getting access</a>) appeared with the “who are you?” request. If connected, the recipient’s answerback came up. This enabled telexes to have legal standing.</p>
<p>A little figuring for inflation with the bill shown, however, will show that the messages, generally not very long, were rather expensive. This led to a lot of people using abbreviations in telexes (such as “u” for “you”, very similar to what you see in text messaging today.) Vulcan’s people never quite got the hang of this. Still, telexes were received in real time, or at least greeted their recipients when they arrived the next morning, which is more than “snail mail” could do then or now.</p>
<p>Telex machines were virtually universal with Vulcan’s international business associates. One Vulcan agent boasted of his own status by informing us that he had his own machine, while some of his competitors used “the public telex!”</p>
<p>One of the more intensive uses of telex took place in 1981 with the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/a-fistful-of-yuan-vulcan-in-china-1981-3/">negotiations and sale of the 560 package to the Petroleum Corporation of the People’s Republic of China</a>. The Chinese were as detailed in their demands of quotation presentation as they were in those for technical information. After a day of negotiations, we composed and sent a telex with our requests back to the U.S., where the day was just started. The next morning we would have our reply and resumed our negotiations. (Telephone calls in and out of China at that time were very difficult, and with a long list of spare parts and prices, would not have done the job.)</p>
<p>After that Vulcan replaced its telex machine (the Florida office was closed) with a newer model, with a dot matrix printer (still on a roll) and a screen terminal for composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless throughout the 1980’s Vulcan’s use of the telex was in decline for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980’s shrunk Vulcan’s international business considerably.</li>
<li>Vulcan obtained CCITT Group 4 faxes in the mid 1980’s, as did its customers. Combined with new economies in long distance service (domestic and international,) fax proved a more practical way to communicate with its customers, both within and outside of the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the early 1990’s telex was pretty much a thing of the past at Vulcan. In 1995, Vulcan obtained its first email address, and the cycle of sending text electronically started all over again. But telex had paved the way.</p>

Donald E. Kimberlin 1996</h4>
<p><a title="(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/haynes-notes.pdf">(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)</a></p>
<p>Telex certainly should be called the original form of E-Mail. Far from “dead” on a global basis, UN reports published in the “Britannica Book of the Year” indicate there are about three million Telex lines around the globe. Contrary to the impression international telephone people like to create, direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world’s political entities than does telephone. This has been the case for many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex. The suspected reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been done, too. Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)</p>
<p>Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automobile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised as a means to distribute military command and control messages and data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing machinery. What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges. The original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.</p>
<p>There was one major difference: Intercity transmission facilities were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25) telegraph channels bearing Telex. The economics are obvious, and probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.</p>
<p>In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages … and it did. Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as “type A Telex signaling.” It is still used that way in many nations. In those you will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial. When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S., it adopted the original style and Type A signaling. Similarly, many other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France and Belgium as well as others. Meantime, (I think it was L. M. Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations adopted what became known as “Type B” Telex. By this time, the CCITT had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50 Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in upspeeding. In this writer’s experience, Cuba and Pakistan are remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Telex grew around the world very rapidly … long before automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel usage. Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with …</p></div></article></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    
    
  
    <p>In this paper from Google, the authors release a model that decomposes images of objects into a set of images, each of which contain one individual object. They train models on a specific dataset, CLEVR, which contains synthetic images of simple geometric objects and release the models. Here we run their pretrained model on an example image from the CLEVR dataset:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*n7JkSFvi99vIVEQ8biBDkA.gif">

    <p>So far so good. But how general is this model? Can we use it to segment other kinds of objects? Here’s the result when we use an image of furniture: the model does not throw any errors, but it fails horribly:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*q0GwW-jP5NvIn5TrupGfJw.gif">

    <p>Okay, so perhaps the model only works with geometric objects. Let’s make a slight adjustment to the original image we used, and increase the brightness of its background. As a user, we would reasonably expect the model to be fairly robust to such simple transformations — certainly our human ability to decompose objects is. However, the model is anything but robust:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*WC7TAORpQdbTm8HRzx2v8A.gif">

    <p>I should be clear here — I don’t think that the model is at fault, nor the authors. The model works very well on the task that it was trained and tested on: decomposing objects in the original CLEVR dataset. However, as a user of the pretrained model, I do not know a priori whether the model will handle other kinds of images. There is no contract that tells me the model should only be used with the original images from the CLEVR dataset.</p>

    You might be thinking that these models are designed for very specific datasets; they are not meant to be generally used with real-world images. However, the situation can be even worse for models designed to work with natural images…

    <h3>3. When input data needs to satisfy other hard-to-define constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Unfolding the Alternating Optimization for Blind Super Resolution
    </p>
    
    

    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.
    </p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <div data-article-id="126" id="article-body">
            <p>Why am I writing this today, of all days? No real reason. It just struck me this morning to share the thought.</p>

<p>We now have an ALL TIME RECORD number (probably 100+) of COSS startups that have raised $5M+ (many have raised $10M+) in VC funding where the following two things are simultaneously True:</p>

<p>1) The COSS company has some early signs of open source momentum/traction as evidenced by GitHub Stars or project Downloads (by the way, both metrics are, on their own, deeply flawed as primary proxies for "company investable" heuristics).</p>

<p>2) The COSS company has no product IP nor clear product plans. Also, goes without saying, the company is "pre-revenue".</p>

<p>Most of these financings have NOT been publicly announced and no single firm has access to all the data (except maybe OSS Capital). In reality, my sense is that 2 out of 5 seed/pre-seed deals never get announced and perhaps the same is true for 1 out of 5 Series A deals. I'm being conservative.</p>

<p>This is a shocking new reality driven primarily by the meteoric rise of great COSS companies like HashiCorp, Elastic, MongoDB, GitHub, MuleSoft, Starburst, Confluent, GitLab and many others over the last 5 ~ years.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to find and seed invest in the next HashiCorp. If you miss that, funding the Series A is also a great idea, no?</p>

<p>Quite simply, over the last 2 ~ years, something on the order of 100+ pre-revenue and pre-product COSS companies have been seriously well funded with nothing more than a deck and a promising open source project. I cannot share this data publicly, but just know that it is accurate and that we have this data.</p>

<p>Basically every VC across all fund sizes under the sun who invests in "tech" (which is vastly digital, which is vastly software, which is vastly open source these days) is now a COSS startup investor.</p>

<p>Is this entirely bad? No. Is this entirely good? Also no. Let me explain...</p>

<p>Why is this "Bad":</p>

<p>-Founders who partner with VCs that do NOT understand the fundamentals of open source are going to be misled, distracted with having to educate their investors from scratch about very nuanced and complex things and their relationships will be extremely far from idealistic. Very few VCs (it is important to focus on the partner/individual at a given firm, not the firm itself.. given that literally only one firm on earth focuses on COSS exclusively) have a deep understanding of open source, let alone COSS, and many/most have zero-to-no track record of actually helping COSS companies successfully navigate their journeys from pre-revenue to PMF and beyond.</p>

<p>-Founders who raise meaningful capital from VC well before even possessing a basic understanding market dynamics will be forced to have full clarity on those issues in short order, and if they are not able to graduate and grow into investor expectations within 1-2 years at most, they will experience very painful misalignment conversations... which will cause them to betray social contracts and principles set in place with other key stakeholders in their open source ecosystems.</p>

<p>Why is this "Good":</p>

<p>-More COSS companies are getting funding than ever, enabling FOSS creators to transform into founders of well funded startups.</p>

<p>-Early-stage COSS companies can take this funding and invest it purely/largely in the growth of their FOSS communities, creating new abundance for the world in a positive-sum way.</p>

<p>-The VC world is learning faster than ever about the fundamental benefits of open source at the core of capitalism and business. This is a huge net positive.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thrilled to see so much COSS funding and we inclusively cover all of it here on COSS Community via COSS Weekly and our data resources. </p>

<p>However, in these times of high capital abundance in the private startup/company equity investing markets, founders should be more careful than ever about deciding who they partner with... this is VASTLY more critical than naively optimizing for "max price for min dilution".</p>

<![CDATA[Building an NLP Engine Is Hard, but Not as Hard as Defining Terms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In my full-time role at <a aria-label="Nuvi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nuvi.com/blog/strategic-decision-making-nuvis-all-new-language-engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nuvi</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where we’re able to push the boundaries in the natural language processing field. We built out several different “facets” that we score text on, including sentiment, emotion, vulgarity, tense, and currently, we’re working on promotion detection.</p>
<p>While the technical side of NLP is hard, one of the hardest things was unexpected – defining the boundaries between the categories in question. Which words count as vulgar? Does anticipation entail positive emotions? Can a single tweet exude anger and fear at the same time despite being opposites according to Plutchik? In this article, we’ll explore some of these questions and how we ended up answering them.</p>
<h2>Emotion Facets</h2>
<p>The eight emotions we set out to build a classification engine for are defined by <a aria-label="Plutchik's wheel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.6seconds.org/2020/08/11/plutchik-wheel-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plutchik’s wheel</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Joy</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Trust</li><li>Disgust</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Surprise</li></ul>
<p>Our emotion detection is based on a probabilistic algorithm that requires training and test data from human-annotations. In order to get a high-quality dataset, we found early on that simply telling our annotators to categorize sentences as to whether or not the author was expressing “anticipation” wasn’t <em>nearly</em> enough instruction. Once we got down to the brass tacks of some specific examples, we found that <em>we didn’t even agree internally</em> on classifications in many instances.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the examples we had trouble with as a team and go over the conclusions we came to. If you have thoughts be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">tweet at me</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of anticipation according to <a aria-label="Oxford (opens in a new tab)" href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oxford</a> is “The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.” In other words, we’re looking for when someone is showing forethought, making a prediction, etc. Here are some examples we agreed on quickly as expressing “anticipation”:</p>
<ul><li>“I can’t wait to go to the movie theater again!”</li><li>“I’m so excited for sports to come back, can’t happen soon enough!”</li><li>“Tesla stock is way too high, it’s going to tank soon.”</li></ul>
<p>The first one we had trouble with was:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m so nervous to go back to the office. Working from home has been great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us had the idea that “anticipation” carried a connotation of “being excited”. In other words, you can’t really anticipate something if you <em>don’t want</em> it to happen. We eventually decided that this isn’t a useful definition for several reasons. First, we already do sentiment classification separately, so baking positive sentiment into the anticipation facet isn’t super helpful. Second, the opposite of anticipation in our emotion wheel is “surprise”. We all agreed that surprises can be good or bad. It stands to reason the surpise’s opposite, anticipation, should behave the same way.</p>
<p>The next problematic example arose a few days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if I’m going to win</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates made the point that this sentence expresses apprehension, which can be considered a form of anticipation. I played devil’s advocate saying that “I don’t know” is the polar opposite of a prediction, how can that be anticipation?</p>
<p>In the end, we found that we had to provide paragraph-long explanations of each category to our annotators, complete with examples of what is and isn’t counted as a part of the category in question.</p>
<h2>Vulgarity Detection</h2>
<p>NSFW Disclaimer: <em>I’m going to talk about our vulgarity detection, and will need to say some naughty words. If you find that offensive turn back now!</em></p>
<p>The way the current iteration of our vulgarity engine works is to take a piece of text as input, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well hot damn those potatos hit the spot!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And output a fractional score from 0-1 representing how likely the text is to contain vulgar text. For the above sample, it might be something like <code>.75</code> Which brings us to our first problem, <strong>what do <em>we</em> consider to be vulgar?</strong></p>
<p>According to one of my teammates “damn”, “shit” and “hell” aren’t bad words. However, while <em>he may not</em> consider them to be, <em><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many people do</a></em>. We’re left in the interesting position of trying to rank all the vulgar words. Here are some of the biggest issues we ran into with vulgarity:</p>
<h3>Not all bad words are created equally</h3>
<p>Most people would loosely agree with the following ranking from most vulgar -&gt; to least vulgar :</p>
<ul><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<h3>Religious / Culture Specific</h3>
<p>However, problems arise when people of different religious beliefs examine the list. A Christian person may consider the following list accurate:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Jesus Christ!</li><li>Oh my God!</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>Whereas the atheist/agnostic/pagan may not consider “Jesus Christ!” or “Oh my God!” to deserve to be on the list at all.</p>
<h3>Geographically Specific</h3>
<p>If you’re from England proper, you may also expect a few additional words:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Wanker</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Bloody</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>In the end, we ended up mixing the concept of probability and intensity for the sake of simplicity and we’ve found that our clients are happy with the result. For example, the presence of an intensely “bad” word that’s recognized by basically everyone as vulgar will have a higher weight in the probability calculation than one which is weaker or not accepted by everyone as “bad”.</p>
<p><code>vulgarity_weight = intensity * acceptance</code></p>
<p>Once we started looking at everything as a fluid spectrum it became much easier to agree amongst ourselves what constitutes “vulgarity”. My coworker who claimed “shit”, “damn”, and “hell” aren’t vulgar easily admitted that they’re <em>more vulgar</em> than trivial interjections like “crap”, “dang”, or “heck”.</p>
<h2>Promotion and Solicitation Detection</h2>
<p>The project we’re working on currently has also turned out to be a vague and difficult one to pin down. The goal is to classify text as to whether it’s promotional or not, but we’ve had a hard time defining what we want. For example, we all agreed quickly that the following we classify as :promotional”:</p>
<ul><li>“We are doing a sweet promo this week! Sign up for 20% off”</li><li>“Our new product just launched, be sure to check it out”</li><li>“GORGEOUS 😍 previously owned Gucci backpack for $1700😍😍 ⭐️WE SHIP ⭐️ Call the store to purchase 555-555-5555 📲”</li></ul>
<p>The following however posed an interesting problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want a $42&nbsp;@gucci lipstick yes I do…. can I afford it right now No I cant&nbsp; but it’s soooo good!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s obviously promoting Gucci, it isn’t actually soliciting direct action from the reader. There’s no call to action. Is this a requirement of a solicitation as scored by Nuvi? We’re not sure yet – but we’re figuring that out.</p>

<![CDATA[Amazon: Not OK – Why we had to change Elastic licensing]]>

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.
</p><p>Thank you. It is a privilege to be on this journey with you.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>My interest in <em>Assembly</em> language started when I was a kid, mainly because of computer viruses of the <code>DOS</code> era. I’ve spent countless hours contemplating my first humble collection of source codes and samples (you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/virii">https://github.com/guitmz/virii</a>) and to me, it’s cool how flexible and creative one can get with <em>Assembly</em>, even if its learning curve is steep.</p>

<p>I’m an independant malware researcher and wrote this virus to learn and have fun, expanding my knowledge on the several <em>ELF</em> attack/defense techniques and <em>Assembly</em> in general.</p>

<p>The code does not implement any evasion techniques and detection is trivial. Samples were also shared with a few major Antivirus companies prior to the release of this code and signatures were created, such as <code>Linux/Midrashim.A</code> by <a href="https://www.eset.com/">ESET</a>. I’m also working on a <em>vaccine</em> which will be available at a later date. I’ll update this post when it’s ready.</p>

<p>The payload is not destructive, as usual. It just prints the harmless lyrics of <a href="https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Ozar_Midrashim">Ozar Midrashim</a> song to <code>stdout</code> and the layout of an infected file is the following (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png">full image</a>):</p>

</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p><code>Midrashim</code> is a <em>64 bits</em> Linux infector that targets ELF files in the current directory (non recursively). It relies on the well known <code>PT_NOTE -&gt; PT_LOAD</code> infection technique and should work on regular and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793">position independent</a> binaries. This method has a high success rate and it’s easy to implement (and detect). Read more about it <a href="https://www.symbolcrash.com/2019/03/27/pt_note-to-pt_load-injection-in-elf/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will not work on <code>Golang</code> executables, because those need the <code>PT_NOTE</code> segment to run properly (infection works, but infected file will segfault after virus execution).</p>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, it makes use of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pread64">pread64</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite64">pwrite64</a> to read/write specific locations in the target file when it should use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> instead, for flexibility and reliability. A few other things could be improved too, like detecting first virus execution with a better approach and more error handling to minimize pitfalls.</p>

<p>I had so many ideas for the payload of Midrashim, from inspiration I got from projects at <a href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net/</a> to controlling the terminal with ANSI escape codes (more on that <a href="https://www.guitmz.com/having-fun-with-ansi-codes-and-x64-linux-assembly/">here</a> - which is something I wrote with Midrashim in mind).</p>

<p>Due to lack of free time and given the complexity of implementing such things in Assembly, specially in a code of this nature, I ended up with something simpler and will probably revisit this subject on a future project.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>This is my first full assembly infector and should be assembled with <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> x64. Its core functionality consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserving space on stack to store values in memory</li>
<li>Checking if its virus first run (displays a different payload message if running for the first time)</li>
<li>Open current directory for reading</li>
<li>Loop through files in the directory, checking for targets for infection</li>
<li>Try to infect target file</li>
<li>Continue looping the directory until no more infection targets are available, then exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Full code with comments is available at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim">https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim</a> and we’ll now go over each step above with a bit more detail.</p>

<h3 id="the-secret-of-getting-ahead-is-getting-started">The secret of getting ahead is getting started</h3>

<p>For the stack buffer, I used <code>r15</code> register and added the comments below for reference when browsing the code.</p>

<p>Note the values, for example, the ELF header, which is <em>64 bytes</em> long. Since <code>r15 + 144</code> represents its start, it should end at <code>r15 + 207</code>. The values in between are also accounted for, like <code>ehdr.entry</code> that starts at <code>r15 + 168</code>, which is <em>8 bytes</em> long, ends at <code>r15 + 175</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; r15 + 0 = stack buffer = stat</span>
<span>; r15 + 48 = stat.st_size</span>
<span>; r15 + 144 = ehdr</span>
<span>; r15 + 148 = ehdr.class</span>
<span>; r15 + 152 = ehdr.pad</span>
<span>; r15 + 168 = ehdr.entry</span>
<span>; r15 + 176 = ehdr.phoff</span>
<span>; r15 + 198 = ehdr.phentsize</span>
<span>; r15 + 200 = ehdr.phnum</span>
<span>; r15 + 208 = phdr = phdr.type</span>
<span>; r15 + 212 = phdr.flags</span>
<span>; r15 + 216 = phdr.offset</span>
<span>; r15 + 224 = phdr.vaddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 232 = phdr.paddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 240 = phdr.filesz</span>
<span>; r15 + 248 = phdr.memsz</span>
<span>; r15 + 256 = phdr.align</span>
<span>; r15 + 300 = jmp rel</span>
<span>; r15 + 350 = directory size</span>
<span>; r15 + 400 = dirent = dirent.d_ino</span>
<span>; r15 + 416 = dirent.d_reclen</span>
<span>; r15 + 418 = dirent.d_type</span>
<span>; r15 + 419 = dirent.d_name</span>
<span>; r15 + 3000 = first run control flag</span>
<span>; r15 + 3001 = decoded payload</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Reserving stack space is easy, there are different ways of doing it, one is to subtract from <code>rsp</code>, then just store it in <code>r15</code>. Also right on start, we store <code>argv0</code> to <code>r14</code> (it’s going to be needed next) and we push <code>rdx</code> and <code>rsp</code>, which need to be restored before the end of virus execution, so the infected file can run properly.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>v_start:</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r14</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span> <span>+</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span>  <span>; saving argv0 to r14</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rdx</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rsp</span>
    <span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>5000</span>       <span>; reserving 5000 bytes</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r15</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>        <span>; r15 has the reserved stack buffer address</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To check for the virus first execution, we get <code>argv0</code> size in bytes and compare to the final virus size, which was stored in <code>V_SIZE</code>. If greater, it’s not the first run and we set a control value into a place in the stack buffer for later use. This was a last minute addition that it’s not great (but pretty easy to implement and rather obvious).</p>

<h3 id="the-wild-hunt">The Wild Hunt</h3>

<p>We need to find targets to infect. For that we’ll open the current directory for reading using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/getdents64">getdents64</a> syscall, which will return the number of entries in it. That goes into the stack buffer.</p>

<p>Now the hunt gets a little more… <em>wild</em>, as we loop through each file from directory listing we just performed. Steps performed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open target file</li>
<li>Validate that it’s an <em>ELF</em> and <em>64 bits</em> (by verifying its magic number and class information from its header)</li>
<li>Check if already infected (by looking for the infection mark that should be set in <code>ehdr.pad</code>) and

<ul>
<li>if yes, move to next file, until all files in the directory are checked</li>
<li>If not, loop through the target <em>Program Headers</em>, looking for a <code>PT_NOTE</code> section, starting the infection process upon finding it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

					<div><h3><span>Vulnerabilities threaten DNS integrity (again)</span></h3>
<p>The JSOF research labs are reporting 7 vulnerabilities found in <em>dnsmasq</em>, an open-source DNS forwarding software in common use. Dnsmasq is very popular, and we have identified approximately 40 vendors whom we believe use dnsmasq in their products, as well as major Linux distributions.</p>
<p><br>The DNS protocol has a history of vulnerabilities dating back to the famous 2008 Kaminsky attack. Nevertheless, a large part of the Internet still relies on DNS as a source of integrity, in the same way it has for over a decade, and is therefore exposed to attacks that can endanger the integrity of parts of the web.</p>
<h3><span>DNSpooq</span></h3>
<p><span>The Dnspooq vulnerabilities include DNS cache poisoning vulnerabilities as well as a potential Remote code execution and others.&nbsp;</span><span>The list of devices using dnsmasq is long and varied.&nbsp;</span><span>According to our internet-based research, prominent users of dnsmasq seem to include Cisco routers, Android phones, Aruba devices, Technicolor, and Red-Hat, as well as Siemens, Ubiquiti networks, Comcast, and others listed below.&nbsp;</span><span>Depending on how they use dnsmasq, devices may be more or less affected, or not affected at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The origin of the name DNSpooq is a merge of 3 elements: DNS spoofing, the idea of a spook spying on Internet traffic, and the ‘q’ at the end of dnsmasq, replacing the ‘k’ of spook with a ‘q’. The spy or spook graphic illustrates the effects of an effective DNS spoofing on the ability to spy on internet traffic. The JSOF-pink glasses show how looking through tainted glasses, or a compromised middleman may alter your perception of the reality.</span></p>
<p><span>DNSpooq demonstrates that DNS implementations are still insecure, even today, 13 years after the last major attack was described.</span></p>
<p>Given the vulnerabilities in DNS over the years, you would think that the security-enhancement mechanisms that have been developed in response,&nbsp; would be ubiquitous by now. However, in reality, DNSSEC is still not very widely deployed, and neither is HSTS. For example, according to research from 2017, adoption of HSTS among the 1M most popular websites <span><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Petrov%2C%20Ivan_1801.pdf">was only at about 5%</a></span>). According to some rough estimates performed by JSOF with the help of large Internet companies, and matching external sources, around <span><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/keeping-up-with-performance-demands-of-encrypted-web-traffic">15-20% of Internet traffic</a></span> is still completely unencrypted, and users still click through to insecure websites.</p>

<h3><span>History</span></h3>
<p>In 2008, well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed a fundamental flaw in the Internet naming scheme that affected the most common DNS software and the integrity of the way the Internet worked at the time.</p>
<p>Kaminsky proved that attackers can impersonate any website name and steal data. (This has since become known as the “Kaminsky Attack”).</p>
<p>DNS has been considered a somewhat insecure protocol for decades, ever since the Kaminsky disclosure and even before that, though it is assumed to guarantee a certain level of integrity. This is the reason it is still heavily relied upon. At the same time, mechanisms have been developed to improve the security of the original DNS protocol. These mechanisms include HTTPS, HSTS, DNSSEC, and other initiatives. Browsers also try to increase users awareness by alerting them before accessing insecure sites with messages such as <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/your-connection-is-not-private/"><span>“Your Connection is Not Private”</span></a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with all these mechanisms in place, a DNS hijack is still a dangerous attack in 2021. A large part of the Internet still relies on DNS in a similar manner as in 2008, and is exposed to attacks of the same types.</p>

					<div><p><span>The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DNS cache poisoning attacks</strong>, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities</strong> that could lead to remote code execution.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>DNS Cache Poisoning:</strong> The impact of DNS cache poisoning of the routing equipment DNS forwarding server can potentially lead to different kinds of fraud if users believe they are browsing to one website but are actually routed to another.</p>
<p>Traffic that might be subverted includes regular Internet browsing as well as other types of traffic, such as emails, SSH, remote desktop, RDP video and voice calls, software updates, and so on. Some of these protocols have built-in measures to mitigate this type of attack, with varying degrees of effectiveness and so YMMV (Your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span>DNS Cache Poisoning</span></strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png" alt="" width="529" height="234" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png 702w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></p>
<p><strong>(2) Device take over: </strong>In addition to cache poisoning, every device on which an attacker can perform DNS cache poisoning can also potentially be taken over by the attacker. For example, in the case of a router, the attacker would then have complete control over all traffic going in and out of the network.</p>
<p>There are additional impacts possible for these types of attacks. <strong><em>These are hypotheticals</em></strong>, since to our knowledge they have never been performed by a malicious actor in this way, but they are a definite possibility if the vulnerabilities are exploited correctly. Even so, given the hypothetical nature of the situation, it is hard to analyze how likely they are to actually occur and what value they could bring to different malicious actors. These possibilities include:<br><strong>(A) Massive DDOS</strong>: Diversion of a large amount of web-traffic to an attacker-controlled website could be used to generate massive JavaScript-fueled Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Simplistic calculations show that the size of the attack could be on the same order of magnitude as the biggest DDOS attacks performed to date.</p>
<p><span><strong>Massive DDOS<br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png" alt="" width="571" height="266" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png 818w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-300x140.png 300w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-768x358.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"><br></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(B) Reverse DDOS</strong>: Prevention of certain users from accessing a website and logging of access attempts to a domain.</p>
<h3><span>Reverse DDOS<strong><br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png" alt="" width="369" height="289" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png 721w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> “<b>Semi-</b><strong><b>Wormable</b>” <b>attacks</b></strong>: In situations where a mobile device moves between networks, the attack may be semi-wormable. It is not wormable in the traditional sense, since there are some pre-conditions and efforts needed on the attacker side for the exploit replication, but is semi-wormable in the sense that the exploit can continue to spread between vulnerable devices without explicit user interaction and without need for additional attacker access. In this scenario, a mobile device that was previously browsing in a network which uses an infected dnsmasq server receives a bad DNS record. When the device reaches a new network, it could infect the new network as well.</p>

  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

    <div>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those
changes</a> have now been merged, so I figured I’d write another <a href="https://defn.io/2020/01/05/racket-on-ios/">one
of these guides</a> while the information is still fresh in my head.</p>
<h2 id="compile-racket-for-macos-and-for-ios">Compile Racket for macOS and for iOS</h2>
<p>You need a recent version of Racket and it’s associated fork of Chez
Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-xcode-project">Set up your XCode project</h2>
<p>To link against and use Racket CS within an XCode project, copy
<code>racketcs.h</code>, <code>racketcsboot.h</code> and <code>chezscheme.h</code> from
<code>racket-ios/include/</code> into a sub-directory of your project, then add
that sub-directory to the “Header Search Paths” section under your
project’s “Build Settings” tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-headers.png" alt="Headers"></p>
<p>Then, disable Bitcode from the same section.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-bitcode.png" alt="Bitcode"></p>
<p>Next, copy <code>libracketcs.a</code>, <code>petite.boot</code>, <code>scheme.boot</code> and
<code>racket.boot</code> from <code>racket-ios/lib</code> into a sub-directory of your
project called <code>vendor/</code> and drag-and-drop the <code>vendor/</code> directory
into your XCode project.  Then, instruct XCode to link <code>libracketcs.a</code>
and <code>libiconv.tbd</code> with your code from the “Build Phases” tab.  You’ll
have to add <code>libracketcs.a</code> to your project using the “Add Other…”
sub-menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-link.png" alt="Link"></p>
<p>Next, add a new C source file called <code>vendor.c</code> and answer “yes” if
prompted to create a bridging header for Swift.  I tend to re-name the
bridging header to plain <code>bridge.h</code> because I don’t like the name that
XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.
From <code>bridge.h</code>, include <code>vendor.h</code> and inside <code>vendor.h</code> add
definitions for <code>racket_init</code> and <code>echo</code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	 <p>Like most SaaS-providers we charge in USD even though we are not based in USA. MakePlans is based in Norway and NOK is the currency of choice here (along with Brent crude oil of course). While we do have some expenses in USD most of our revenue would eventually end up in our Norwegian bank account in NOK. When using Stripe for card payments they will handle currency conversion when they pay out in your local currency. While doing this they charge a <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">2% currency conversion fee</a>. That is on top of their already high fees (2,9% for foreign cards here in Norway!).</p>

<h2 id="unavailable-options">Unavailable options</h2>

<p>Turns out avoiding Stripe currency conversion fees wasn’t that easy. Here are the options we investigated:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-local-usd-account">Use a local USD account</h3>

<p>From the start we assumed this could easily be solved by having a local USD account. Most bigger banks offer USD accounts and we could easily open one. There would be some incoming transfer fees payable to the bank but a lot less than the 2% Stripe charges.</p>

<p><em>But Stripe only supports USD payouts to bank accounts in USA and Canada.</em> So while we did some research here it was pointless as such an account could not be used for payouts from Stripe.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-a-local-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with a local bank</h3>

<p>Our next research mission was to open a bank account in the USA. The easiest would be using a local bank but going into the process we were informed that it was not allowed to open what they call a personal account. Even though this would be a business account this rule comes into action when the business is majority owned by one person. As is the case with MakePlans. And that person would not sell of half of the company just to get a bank account in USA.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-an-american-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with an American bank</h3>

<p>So as a European company this leaves us one option: open a bank account in USA. While starting a US company is a lot more complicated than starting a company here in Norway (can be done in less than 30 minutes including getting a bank account) there are options for opening up a company fairly smoothly. And no reason to follow all the Google search results - Stripe actually offers a way to this. It is called <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a>. If you need a US company for other reason this seems like a good way to go. But it will mean that have all the obligations that comes with having another company and it being in USA. It will also complicate tax reporting in your company structure. So while some research was conducted here we quickly dismissed this idea and I don’t recommend it unless you need a US company for other reasons.</p>

<h2 id="enter-transferwise">Enter TransferWise</h2>

<p>I have used <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> a few times and it seems like a good option for money transfer and while I knew about their card offering I never really looked into too much as I was using Revolut when travelling to save on currency conversion fees for private usage. I guess it was around the time when Revolut launched their business offering I started looking into TransferWise Business. It got me excited but <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a> only offers a USD account in the UK, and as you already know now Stripe only supports payout in USD to accounts located in USA and Canada. TransferWise however do offer a USD account in USA. You will get a fully functional business bank account with routing and account number. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>Getting instant 2% profit is quick and easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/i/espena8">Register for a TransferWise business account</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/flows/open-balance#/">Open a USD balance in TransferWise</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the TransferWise USD bank account details in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts">Stripe dashboard ‘Payout settings’ section</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From now on all your USD charges will be paid out in USD and you will no longer pay any currency conversion fees to Stripe.</p>

<p>As a bonus you can use your shiny new TransferWise card and pay your expenses such as Heroku or Amazon directly in USD. Saving you even more in currency conversion fees as your local card usually will charge 2% as well. Double win!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

  <li>Free to open account.</li>
  <li>Free debit Mastercard.</li>

        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫
        </p>

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - power supply unit - insertion" width="1080" height="817" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-624x472.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>

<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

<p>And when WhatsApp announced changes to their data-sharing policy, Signal exploded.</p>

</div>
<div data-id="3f0d7d8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>But this rapid growth has introduced a UX complexity: the app is now being used by a much broader group of people.</p>

<div>
<p>Signal <em>may</em> be more private than WhatsApp, but if they ever want to rival their 2 billion users (yes, you read that correctly), then they’ll need a product that’s <strong>just as easy to use</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7066953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The golden question is this: when the hype dies, will people be able to convince their lazy friends, who don’t care about internet privacy, to sign up?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="6777d1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

His data show that an <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/04/procrastination">estimated 20% of men and women</a> in the U.S. are chronic procrastinators. </p><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong> is a writer on the topic of productivity. He surveyed over two thousand professionals and found that <a href="https://medium.com/darius-foroux/how-common-is-procrastination-a-study-80869467c3f3">88% of them had procrastinated</a> for at least one hour on the previous day. The research is clear. Big or small, a little bit or habitual, procrastination is a problem that plagues productivity. </p><p>At Doit we help you get things done. If procrastination is getting in the way of doing your to-do list, this article is for you. This guide shares the surprising real reason we procrastinate, presents ideas to stop procrastinating and start doing <em>now</em>, and practices for getting out of the procrastination habit for good. Let’s do it.</p><h2 id="what-is-procrastination">What is Procrastination?</h2><p>Oxford Languages defines procrastination as “the act of postponing or delaying something.” That simple definition shows that procrastination is far reaching. It is not limited to school work or professional projects or personal obligations. Procrastination is omnipresent and can happen in every aspect of our lives.</p><p>College students are notorious procrastinators. Research papers and study sessions are put off until mere hours before the assignment is due or the test is administered. At work, professionals wait until the day before a big presentation to put together their speaking notes and infographics. Patients with anxiety about dental work put off seeing a dentist year after year until unavoidable pain pushes them to make an appointment.</p><p>The basic meaning leaves out an important aspect of procrastination illustrated by the examples above. When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing. &nbsp;A week before a deadline, we readily wander onto a social media feed or grab a snack or make a phone call to a friend. The day before that deadline, things look very different. We wait until we have no choice but to dive in and take care of the suddenly pressing problem, project, or task.</p><p>People who procrastinate are often mislabeled as lazy. Many of us even engage in self talk about how lazy or unfocused we are when we engage in procrastination. But procrastination is not a reflection of someone’s work ethic or their ability to focus. There’s more to it than that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Chronic procrastinators know that waiting will cause more harm than good. We know that this choice will ultimately lead to a worse outcome for us physically, emotionally, and otherwise, but we do it anyway. The Ancient Greeks called this state of mind “acrasia.” Our modern understanding of procrastination finds its roots in this bygone term, which means <strong>doing something “against your better judgement.” </strong></p><p>Why, oh why, would we put off the mere <em>potential</em> for pain today when we know with certainty it will cause worse suffering down the road? There are scientific theories behind that and they have nothing to do with work ethic or time management or motivation. The reasons are, surprisingly, rooted in our emotions.</p><h2 id="the-real-reason-we-procrastinate">The Real Reason We Procrastinate</h2><p>Dr. Fuschia Sirois is a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">told The New York Times</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to do something you know is going to have negative consequences.” She added, “ “People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.”</p><p>Dr. Tim Pychyl is also a professor of psychology and a member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. He said, “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.” <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91793/1/Compass%20Paper%20revision%20FINAL.pdf">Sirois and Pychyl teamed up in 2013</a> to research the notion that people place a priority on their immediate emotional needs over those of their future selves via procrastination. Here’s what they concluded.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>When faced with an “aversive” task, i.e. something that we find “boring, frustrating, lacking in meaning and/or structure,” we react with negative feelings and moods. Then we have a choice. We can get through those feelings and moods via “self-regulation” or we can succumb to the immediately protective choice of procrastination. Most of us choose the short-term solution. Avoiding the task gives us an emotional lift. We feel better. So we do it, or rather, <em>avoid doing it</em>, again and again. And before we know it, we are chronically procrastinating.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-procrastination">The Problem with Procrastination</h2><p>Sirois and Pychyl’s research shows that our future selves are paying a dear price for the short-term gratification we receive when we put things off. We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</p><p>We believe that when we sit down to work tomorrow, or next week, or next month before the big deadline, we will <em>feel</em> like doing it. But we are wrong. When we choose the temporary <a href="https://blog.doit.io/how-to-stay-focused-when-you-get-bored-working-toward-your-goals/">reprieve from boredom</a>, frustration, or challenge and kick the can down the road to our future selves, we are only making matters cumulatively worse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For one thing, a constant current of anxiety and tension will be along for the entire procrastination ride. This nagging looming deadline will be churning in the background, coloring our daily mood and impacting our health and well being. The negative feelings we have about the task itself make us procrastinate. That, in turn, leads to ruminating negative thoughts about the act of procrastination itself. It’s a cycle that has a snowball effect, gathering more self blame, shame, anxiety, and stress along the way.</p><p>For another, when we finally decide it’s “go time,” our job is much more daunting than it was before. We now have to take on a monumental task instead of one that is simply boring or frustrating. We will be faced with cramming a month’s worth of work into just a day or two. We won’t eat right, we sure won’t sleep right, our stress levels will soar, and our minds and bodies will suffer as a result.</p><p>It’s like credit card debt. The bill is going to come due. We can pay the full balance now, which is going to put a dent in our immediate account. Or, we can allow it to grow bigger and bigger as the interest charges stack up, costing us way more every single step along the way. Chronic procrastinators put it all on credit and pay significantly more in the end.</p><h2 id="5-techniques-to-stop-procrastinating-today">5 Techniques to Stop Procrastinating Today</h2><p>When we think about breaking free from the bad habit of procrastination, we benefit from taking a multipronged approach. We have a better chance of succeeding when we look at short term, immediate techniques as well as changes we can make in the long run that will help us make chronic procrastination a permanent part of our past. First, let’s look at ways to find immediate relief from putting a task off so we can get going at getting it done. </p><h3 id="1-short-list">1. Short List</h3><p>There is a reason why to-do lists stand the test of time when it comes to organization and productivity. They work! This list technique is all about keeping it short and simple.</p><p>Make a list of 3-6 things that you want to get done during your next work period. Put them in <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-myth-of-multitasking/">order of the most important</a> or time sensitive to the least important or time sensitive. Start working on the first task until it is finished. Check it off, mark it out, and move to the next item. Keep going until your work session ends. Move any tasks that are left undone to the new list you will create for your next session.</p><p>The new list should also be put in priority order. Lower priority tasks that are not time sensitive may be copied over to the bottom spot from list to list for days or even weeks! Don’t beat yourself up about it. Just keep it on the list until you get to it.</p><p>A note on timing: Some people like to make their list at the end of the previous work day or session. If you tend to ruminate at night and lose sleep when a list is running through your mind, plan to make the list as soon as you enter your work space the next day instead.</p><h3 id="2-digitally-declutter">2. Digitally Declutter</h3><p>Let’s face it. Distractions are very easily found these days. If you tend to wander into social media or headline news or your personal inbox instead of working on the more pressing task at hand, it’s time to digitally declutter your workspace.</p><p>The idea here is to make it harder to get distracted by removing the devices that hold those distractions. So, let’s say you need to create an outline for an upcoming …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>Guest Author</em>: <a href="https://github.com/sreekarsr">Sreekar</a></p>

<p>As part of a course on <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2019b-EE2025/index.html">Engineering Electromagnetics</a> in the Fall 2019 semester, we had to make a poster on a topic of our interest which involved electromagnetics, which we had to present at our department, on a fine Saturday afternoon (19.10.2019).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">How did we come up with this topic?<a href="#how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">#</a></h2>

<p>With my exams of the course having gone really bad (I still have nightmares about it :( ), I was determined to make my group’s poster one of the best that will be put up on poster day. The three of us, Sreekar, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithin-varma-17ba3b174">Nithin Varma</a> and I searched the internet for a topic that was “unconventional” and interesting. After a week or so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">following links on Wikipedia</a>, I came across this article - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)">Whistler (radio)</a>, which caught my eye. It was a topic that most would have not heard about and would be very much interested in learning about it. Bazinga!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sreekar had come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence">Birefringence</a>, which also seemed interesting. None of us had heard about it before. With these two topics in mind, we asked our instructor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ee.iitm.ac.in/deepav/">Dr. Deepa Venkitesh</a> for her opinion and she asked us to go with the former.</p>

<p>Before I start explaining the technical details of the poster, do take a look at the poster we made (click on it for a PDF).

<p>In World War I, soldiers used long communication lines to maintain contact with their base. The people on the receiving side of the line, often could hear sounds that were very similar to that of <em>“falling grenades”</em>, when there were none falling. One keen observation was that this particular sound was heard during the times of lightning strikes.</p>

<p>Here’s a short sound clip of what they heard:</p>

<p>The first one, in which you would have noticed a tone of descending frequency, is called a <strong>Whistler</strong>, while the second, which consists of rising and falling tones of frequency is a <strong>Chorus</strong>. This post will talk more on whistlers as they are more extensively studied among the two.</p>

<p><strong>Whistlers</strong> are Very Low Frequency (VLF) emissions in the atmosphere that are characterised by a <em>tone of rapidly descending frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>Being long-wavelength (~ 100 km!!) <em>EM Waves</em>, it’s understandable that they couple into communication lines that are as long as 100 km. This explains the strange noises heard by soldiers in WWI.</p>

<h3 id="sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">Sources and generation of whistlers<a href="#sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>A natural question to ask is how these waves are generated in the first place. The literature on this is limited, but there is considerable evidence to say that the source of whistlers must be not very different from lightning.</p>

<p>The only known characteristic of whistlers that distinguishes it from ordinary lightning is their relatively high energy content. After accounting for attenuation losses, the estimated electromagnetic energy in a whistler producing stroke is about ten times as great as that in the average lightning flash. A sufficiently strong lightning flash should be able to produce whistler-mode signals.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing - we also detect these waves at locations where there may be no lightning at all. In fact, these waves can also be detected at places whose <em>magnetically conjugate point</em> has experienced a lightning strike. That means that there must be some <em>mode of propagation</em> that is making this possible. The theory behind it’s propagation can be intuitively understood using the basic concepts of a waveguide.</p>

<h3 id="waveguides">Waveguides<a href="#waveguides">#</a></h3>

<p>To the uninitiated, here’s the wikipedia definition of a waveguide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- pic of waveguide -->

<p>It literally is in the name - It “guides” waves, sort of like a tunnel (over-simplified). One very popular waveguide is the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_Fibre">optical fibre</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest idealised case of a waveguide is a <em>parallel plate waveguide</em>, in which the wave is constrained between <em>two conductors</em>. Solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions will give us a solution which has a wave that propagates in a direction tangential to the plates.</p>

<p>Now, consider the earth and the ionosphere. The earth is a good conductor, in the sense that at the frequencies we are talking about (KHz), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss#Loss_tangent">loss tangent</a>, is about 600.</p>

<p>The ionosphere, as its name suggests, has a lot of ions, making it a good conductor as well. What we now have is a waveguide through which EM waves, more specifically VLF waves, can be guided through.</p>

<h3 id="propagation-of-whistlers">Propagation of Whistlers<a href="#propagation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>Energy from a lightning source near the earth’s surface travels in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and enters the ionosphere continuously along the lower surface of the ionosphere. Wave components that enter the ionosphere at the location of a duct are then trapped and “conveyed” to the opposite hemisphere along the same magnetic line of force, which are aligned exactly along the duct, where they emerge from the ionosphere and re-enter the earth-ionosphere waveguide.</p>

<p>So…, a bunch of frequencies is generated by a lightning strike at a location, <em>at the same time</em>. All of them take the same path and reach another location. So, ideally we should be receiving all the frequencies at the same time. But we hear a tone of descending frequency. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The reason lies in the ionosphere. The velocity of propagation of a wave through the ionosphere is dependent on it’s frequency. This leads to a dispersion of waves, with each frequency traveling at a different speed.</p>

<p><img title="graph of $1/\sqrt{f} vs t" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Graph.png"></p>

<p>Graph of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}$ vs $t$ (time of arrival)</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>Due to the dispersion of waves in the ionosphere depending on their frequencies, different frequencies are received at different times, with the higher frequencies being received first, as seen from the above graph. This is why a whistler is a tone of descending frequency.</p>

<p>The theory’s great. But how do we practically detect and hear these sounds?</p>

<p>Since these are electromagnetic waves, we have to first “capture” these EM waves, then transduce them, i.e. convert them to audio to actually hear the audio clips you heard before.</p>

<p>The wavelength of these waves are extremely huge (100 km for a 3KHz wave). This means that it is not possible to have a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php">full-wavelength antenna</a>, for capturing the wave accurately. A typical VLF receiver is about 60ft long - there is very little signal current for reception. Using a cascaded combination of high gain, high input impedance (for better sensitivity) amplifiers and low pass filters, we can make up for the difference.</p>

<p>What’s a <em>spectrogram</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a graph, with x-axis as time (usually), y-axis as frequency and the intensity/amplitude at a point $(f, t)$ is given by it’s color.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201.jpg">

<p>Source: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio</a>)</i></p>

<p>This is a real-life spectrogram of a whistler. At around <strong>0355:29</strong>, you can a see a band of frequencies being generated. This is called a <em>tweek</em>.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201-mark-tweek.jpg">
</p><p>Tweek in a spectrogram</p>

<p>At near <strong>0355:31</strong>, you see that the “tone of descending frequencies” has started. Notice how there’s a time delay between the tweek and the start of the whistler. This tells us that it is detected elsewhere (remember the magnetically conjugate point?), meaning it has travelled (or the whistler has been detected at the same place as the tweek.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Helliwell">Robert A. Helliwell</a>, in his book <em>Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena</em>, the idealised spectrogram for a whistler is:
<img title="ideal-spectrogram" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202.png"></p>

<p>Ideal whistler spectrograms</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>There’s a lot more in the above diagram than just ideal spectrograms. The figure shows us a wealth of information.</p>

<p>If you look closely, we can see the ideal spectrogram containing all the “<em>reflections</em>” of the whistler.</p>

<p><strong>Hold On!</strong> Where did reflections come from?
Well, as I had mentioned that it propagates, I had mentioned that the tweek generated would travel into an ionospheric duct, then come back into the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Well, EM waves, in fact any wave, simply don’t do nothing when they travel from one medium to another.</p>

<p>Because of the change in refractive indices of the media, some of the energy carried by the waves will be reflected into the first medium, and the rest will be transmitted into the second (there’s also absorption of energy, but I’m ignoring that as it is very less compared to the other two).</p>

<p>In this part of the above figure,
<img title="box1" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box1.png">
we can see the tweek, and also a number of whistlers, each dragged out more than the previous. Such whistlers are detected at the same place of origin of the tweek. They are called as <em><strong>Odd-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, since they have “hopped” or “jumped” (i.e. reflected) an odd number of times.</p>

<p><em>Why are they getting dragged out more?</em> Because, each undergoes a greater amount of dispersion than the previous as they travel a lot more distance after each reflection before detecting them.</p>

<p>Similarly, in this part of the figure,
<img title="box2" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box2.png">
we can see all the <em><strong>Even-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, and these are detected at the magnetically conjugate point to the point of origin of the tweek.</p>

<p>I had mentioned that the waves get dispersed in the ionosphere, right? Well, later studies showed that according to dispersion theory, every whistler should have a characteristic frequency (not necessarily the maximum frequency detected), that has the minimum time delay. This frequency is called <em>the nose …</em></p></article></div>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Kenny Chow was</strong> <strong>born</strong> in Myanmar, and moved to New York City in 1987. He worked for years as a diamond setter for a jeweller, earning enough to buy a house for his family before he was laid off in 2011. At that point, Chow decided to become a taxi driver like his brother, scraping together financing to buy a taxi medallion for $750,000. This allowed him to operate as a sole proprietor, with the medallion as an asset.</p>
<p>For a while, everything went according to plan, with taxi medallions rising in value to more than <span>$1 million.</span> Then the bubble burst, and along came ridesharing apps such as Lyft and Uber. The value of Chowâ€™s medallion plummeted, and it became harder to keep up the payments on his loan. In 2018, he took his own life.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d all recognise that Chowâ€™s situation is unfortunate. But, arguably, he took a calculated gamble when he purchased a risky asset, and so some of us might be tempted to blame him for his own misfortune. According to one school of thought, when these sorts of bets donâ€™t pan out, only the gambler is to blame. That might sound callous, but itâ€™s indeed the attitude that many of us seem to hold, at least in the United States: a 2014 Pew Research report <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/26/section-3-fairness-of-the-economic-system-views-of-the-poor-and-the-social-safety-net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">found</a> that <span>39 per cent</span> of Americans believed that poverty was due to a lack of effort on poor peopleâ€™s part. When â€˜effortâ€™ includes an inability to properly weigh up the risks inherent in a decision, this suggests that, in the end, many of us think that people are responsible for their own bad luck.</p>
<p>I disagree with this view. But my reasons arenâ€™t solely political or moral in nature. Rather, insights from complexity science â€“ specifically, computational complexity theory â€“ show mathematically that there are hard limits on our capacity to make accurate and precise calculations of risk. Since itâ€™s often impossible to get a reasonable sense of what will happen in the future, itâ€™s unfair to blame people with good intentions who end up worse off as a result of unforeseen circumstances. This leads to the conclusion that compassion, not blame, is the appropriate attitude towards those who act in good faith but whose bets in life donâ€™t pay off.</p>
<p>The starting point is to note that, for people to be held responsible for their actions, they have to know about certain features of the world. In many cases, even this minimal condition for blameworthiness isnâ€™t satisfied. For example, Chow would have struggled to predict that the rise of ridesharing apps would crater the market for taxi medallions in New York City â€“ but so, too, did most of us. By their very nature, technological disruptions are difficult to foresee; if they were easy to predict, early investors in these technologies wouldnâ€™t get so rich. Such a low bar for blameworthiness seems too harsh to be plausible; how can any of us be blamed for failing to spot trends that almost no one was able to see, despite the significant material incentives for doing so?</p>
<p>The bar for blameworthiness can be made more precise by saying that, in order to be blamed for a gamble, people must possess an accurate causal model of the system in which they act. That is, they must know how different variables in the system do or donâ€™t affect one another. Chowâ€™s bet on a taxi medallion went poorly because of a complex causal nexus of speculation and technological development that led the price for taxi medallions to rise steadily before falling precipitously. To predict the collapse in the price of taxi medallions without the benefit of luck, one would need to have a crisp picture of this labyrinthine causal structure.</p>
<p>Under conditions of extreme complexity, itâ€™s rarely the case that people meet the bar for blameworthiness</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s where computational complexity theory kicks in. It turns out that learning the causal structure of real-world systems is very hard. More precisely, trying to infer the most likely causal structure of a system â€“ no matter how much data we have about it â€“ is what theorists call an NP-hard problem: given a general dataset, it can be fiendishly hard for an algorithm to learn the causal structure that produced it. In many cases, as more variables are added to the dataset, the minimum time that it takes any algorithm to learn the structure of the system under study grows exponentially. Under the <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-probably-is-a-computer-whatever-that-means" rel="noopener">assumption</a> that our brains also learn by running algorithms, these results apply to human reasoning just as much as they apply to any computer.</p>
<p>One way to get around these constraints is to assume that the real world has a relatively simple causal structure: for example, we could assume that no variable in a system (say, the price of oil) depends on more than two other variables (say, demand and supply of oil). If we restrict the possibilities in this way, then estimating a causal structure becomes less difficult. Such heuristic approaches are a crucial part of how humans actually form beliefs, as the philosopher Julia Staffel has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nous.12254" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">argued</a>. However, treating a complex system as though itâ€™s simple is a dangerous game; heuristics can misrepresent the world in consequential ways. Indeed, the unpredictability of the course of our lives is partly due to rich causal complexity of the social world, with its interlocking web of economic, political, psychological and other factors. Under these conditions of extreme complexity, which are typical of most real-world systems, itâ€™s rarely the case that people can ever meet the bar for blameworthiness described above.</p>
<p><strong>A better way</strong> <strong>for</strong> a person to deal with the overwhelming complexity of the social world is to hedge their bets. By investing so much of his worth in a taxi medallion, Chow put all his eggs in one basket. So, you might say, he made himself particularly susceptible to ruin. What individuals should do instead, perhaps, is pursue a diverse range of offsetting strategies that eliminate or drastically reduce the risk of catastrophe, even under conditions of severe uncertainty.</p>
<p>The problem is that much of economic and social life in affluent countries is structured to require individuals to commit most of their resources towards one strategy for pursuing a flourishing life. Taking out a student loan or mortgage, or buying a taxi medallion, are all strategies that require a large, if not total, commitment of a personâ€™s financial resources. Here, real hedging would require us to start from a place of considerable wealth, and so it isnâ€™t a viable strategy for many. Most of us remain consigned to placing big bets in a casino where itâ€™s effectively impossible to know the underlying odds. The precarity of this situation means that compassion, not blame, is the appropriate attitude to have towards those who end up on the losing end of these bets.</p>
<p>Questions about the attitudes that we ought to have towards others are psychological and moral in nature. But theyâ€™re also politically significant. How we regard those who end up less fortunate informs how we address social inequality, and the extent to which we care about it. This brings us back to Kenny Chowâ€™s death, and indeed, the deaths of so many others. Since the year 2000, life expectancy in the US has fallen, as the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shown</a> â€“ and this decrease has been driven almost entirely by an increase in what they call â€˜deaths of despairâ€™, such as drug overdoses and suicides. Despair thrives where empathy is missing; right now, our lack of compassion for one another is killing us.</p>
<p>Reversing this trend requires a policy response, but it also requires a shift in our attitudes towards those who end up worse off as a result of risky but well-intentioned decisions. The limits of our ability to infer the complex causal structure of the social world lead directly to the conclusion that blame isnâ€™t appropriate. No matter how smart we think we are, thereâ€™s a hard limit on what we can know, and we could easily end up on the losing end of a big bet. We owe it to ourselves, and others, to build a more compassionate world.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
    <div>
<p>Prompted by tweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes">Lesley</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave</a>, I thought about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switches</a> again and came up with a rather cheap solution to my individual situation (YMMY, as usual).</p>
<p>As I've <a href="https://www.die-welt.net/2020/06/show-your-desk/">written last year</a>, my desk has one monitor, keyboard and mouse and two computers. Since writing that post I got a new (bigger) monitor, but also an USB switch again (a <a href="https://www.digitus.info/en/products/computer-and-office-accessories/computer-accessories/usb-components-and-accessories/switches/da-73300-1/">DIGITUS USB 3.0 Sharing Switch</a>) - this time one that doesn't freak out my dock \o/</p>
<p>However, having to switch the used computer in two places (USB and monitor) is rather inconvenient, but also getting an KVM switch that can do 4K@60Hz was out of question.</p>
<p>Luckily, hackers gonna hack, everything, and not only receipt printers (😉). There is a tool called <a href="https://www.ddcutil.com/"><code>ddcutil</code></a> that can talk to your monitor and change various settings. And <code>udev</code> can execute commands when (USB) devices connect… You see where this is going?</p>
<p>After installing the package (available both in Debian and Fedora), we can inspect our system with <code>ddcutil detect</code>. You might have to load the <code>i2c_dev</code> module (thanks Philip!) before this works -- it seems to be loaded automatically on my Fedora, but you never know 😅.</p>

<p>The first detected display is the built-in one in my laptop, and those don't support DDC anyways. The second one is a ghost (see <a href="https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/160">ddcutil#160</a>) which we can ignore. But the third one is the one we can (and will control). As this is the only <em>valid</em> display <code>ddcutil</code> found, we don't need to specify which display to talk to in the following commands. Otherwise we'd have to add something like <code>--display 1</code> to them.</p>
<p>A <code>ddcutil capabilities</code> will show us what the monitor is capable of (or what it thinks, I've heard some give rather buggy output here) -- we're mostly interested in the "Input Source" feature (Virtual Control Panel (VCP) code <code>0x60</code>):</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil capabilities
<span>…</span>
<span>   Feature: 60 (Input Source)</span>
<span>      Values:</span>
<span>         0f: DisplayPort-1</span>
<span>         11: HDMI-1</span>
<span>         12: HDMI-2</span>
<span>…</span>
</pre>
<p>Seems mine supports it, and I should be able to switch the inputs by jumping between <code>0x0f</code>, <code>0x11</code> and <code>0x12</code>. You can see other values defined by the spec in <code>ddcutil vcpinfo 60 --verbose</code>, some monitors are using wrong values for their inputs 🙄. Let's see if <code>ddcutil getvcp</code> agrees that I'm using DisplayPort now:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil getvcp 0x60
<span>VCP code 0x60 (Input Source                  ): DisplayPort-1 (sl=0x0f)</span>
</pre>
<p>And try switching to HDMI-1 using <code>ddcutil setvcp</code>:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x11
</pre>
<p>Cool, cool. So now we just need a way to trigger input source switching based on some event…</p>
<p>There are three devices connected to my USB switch: my keyboard, my mouse and my Yubikey. I do use the mouse and the Yubikey while the laptop is not docked too, so these are not good indicators that the switch has been turned to the laptop. But the keyboard is!</p>
<p>Let's see what vendor and product IDs it has, so we can write an <code>udev</code> rule for it:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> lsusb
<span>…</span>
<span>Bus 005 Device 006: ID 17ef:6047 Lenovo ThinkPad Compact Keyboard with TrackPoint</span>
<span>…</span>
</pre>
<p>Okay, so let's call <code>ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x0f</code> when the USB device <code>0x17ef:0x6047</code> is added to the system:</p>
<pre>ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="17ef", ATTR{idProduct}=="6047", RUN+="/usr/bin/ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x0f"
</pre>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ddcutil.rules
<span>$</span> sudo udevadm control --reload
</pre>
<p>And done! Whenever I connect my keyboard now, it will force my screen to use DisplayPort-1.</p>
<p>On my workstation, I deployed the same rule, but with <code>ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x11</code> to switch to HDMI-1 and my cheap not-really-KVM-but-in-the-end-KVM-USB-switch is done, for the price of one USB switch (~30€).</p>
<p>Note: if you want to use <code>ddcutil</code> with a Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Dock (or any other dock using Displayport Multi-Stream Transport (MST)), you'll need <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/adb48b26985686f93f20ca71c16c067d790e7af3">kernel 5.10</a> or newer, which fixes a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/37">bug</a> that prevents <a href="https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/11"><code>ddcutil</code> from talking to the monitor using I²C</a>.</p>

January 18, 2021 | https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>So, let's start the discussion with a graph, and then I'll explain what it means and where it came from:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/herd_imm_check.png"></p>
<p>Each point on this graph is one of the states, and the red ellipse shows where North and South Dakota are.  The x axis shows the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in that state, since the beginning of the pandemic (per the CDC data, as pulled from John Hopkins' excellent <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">github repository of covid-19 info</a>).  The Dakotas have had total confirmed cases in the neighborhood of 12% of their population.</p>
<p>The y axis, is comparing the most recent 7 days to the worst week (in that state) in the last 3 months.  So, for example, Texas (currently peaking) looks like this:<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/Texas_ConfirmedCases.png">
</p><p>Therefore, Texas has a "1.0" on the y-axis, since the most recent 7 days are the highest level seen in the last 12 weeks (the current wave).  New York, Louisiana, New Jersey, Hawaii, and a lot of other states are also at 1.0.  However, some states like Illinois are at a lower level (in this case, 0.486).<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/Illinois_ConfirmedCases.png"></p>
<p>Note that the peaks for Texas and Illinois are not quite the same; Illinois' was a little higher, as a percent of the population.  Different states have different populations, but also different population densities, and it's harder to stop an epidemic if people are living cheek by jowl in the same apartment building, for example.  So each state is compared to the peak (worst) week for that state (out of the last 12), with 1.0 meaning the most recent week is the worst they've seen, and lower numbers meaning that it has gotten better than that.  Here's what North and South Dakota look like.</p>
<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/North_Dakota_ConfirmedCases.png">
<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/South_Dakota_ConfirmedCases.png">

<h2>What Does This Mean?</h2>
<p>Now, the fact that states with higher total confirmed cases, are seeing fewer cases now (per capita, compared to their peak in the last 3 months) is not in itself surprising.  That's the way pandemics normally work.  The fire burns through most of the dry tinder, and then it goes out.  What is surprising is that we are seeing this already with a number as low as ~12%, as in the Dakotas.  How can a number that low lead to herd immunity?</p>
<p>One thing that should be mentioned here is that "herd immunity" has nothing to do with "culling the herd", and also does not mean that every single member of the "herd" is immune.  What it means is that the percentage of the population that are immune, is too high for an epidemic to be self-sustaining.  If another person gets sick, most of the people they expose to the virus are already resistant, and not enough people get sick to keep things going.  It's kind of like how the ash left behind after a campfire is not all, completely 100% consumed; there is often still more fuel there.  But enough of it was turned to ash, that the fire was not self-sustaining.  Once a population has reached "herd immunity", new exposures to the virus sputter and die out quickly.  The odd thing is, that this should happen with a number as low as 12%.</p>
<p>One possibility, is that the previous estimates of needing 70% of the population to be resistant before you reach herd immunity, were simply incorrect.  A lot depends on who exactly gets it, and if the people who are "super-spreaders" (people with service industry jobs who interact with a lot of other people in a day, for example) are also the first to get it (not an unreasonable guess), then the number could be a lot lower.  If your 12% includes all the potential super-spreaders, maybe 12% is enough.  That would be hard to manage, though, and my guess is that's not what's going on here.</p>
<p>The main issue is that not all people who get infected with covid-19, get this confirmed with a test.  Some of them are asymptomatic, and never know they are infected.  Some are not very sick, and don't get tested because there's no reason for them to (they're just going to stay home, regardless).  Some people are afraid to know the truth.  There may also be a few people who get counted more than once, if they get tested multiple times and test positive each time.  So, we need a way to guess at the ratio of confirmed cases (including those who are double-counted), to actual cases (with no double-counting).</p>
<p>Estimates of the actual mortality rate for covid-19 are contentious, but <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf">John Ioannidis published a paper</a> which collected together many different seroprevalence studies, to estimate something like 0.23% of people who get covid-19 will die from it.  He points out that it could be different for different regions, though, either because of different strains or differences in the local population or healthcare response, so let's take an estimate of twice that for the U.S., or 0.46%.  At about the same time as the data was collected (April and May), the U.S. had .05% confirmed cases per week, and 0.0015% deaths per week.</p>
<pre>actual cases         .000015 deaths
------------    *    ---------------------    ===&gt;   6.52 actual cases per confirmed case
.0046 deaths         .0005 confirmed cases
</pre>
<p>It would be nice to have some kind of double-check of this ratio.  Fortunately, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30948-8/fulltext">Slovakia provided one</a>.  "The country made international headlines as, over the last weekend of October, Slovak authorities tested almost all the country's adult population for coronavirus. A total of 3.6 million people out of an estimated 4 million target population were tested that weekend with a countrywide positivity rate of 1.06%."  Given that the test was (necessarily, being cheap and capable of being deployed on such a massive scale) not as accurate as more conventional tests, the rate may have been as high as 2%.  Given that conventional measures ("confirmed cases") was around 0.25%, that would give us a ratio of actual cases to confirmed cases somewhere in the range of 4-8.</p>
<p>Now, neither of these numbers are super-precise, and in any case, we should not expect the ratio of confirmed cases to actual cases to be the same everywhere.  Different governments and different healthcare systems would be expected to result in a different likelihood for a person who is actually infected with covid-19, to go get tested to confirm it.  But the fact that both methods, based on different datasets in different countries, provide similar answers, is encouraging that we are somewhere in the ballpark.  For every "confirmed case", we have something like 4-8 people who have actually been infected with covid-19.</p>
<p>Now, the results in the Dakotas start to be less surprising.</p>
<p>If the number of confirmed cases per capita is 12.545% (North Dakota) or 11.862% (South Dakota), then the actual percentage of the population that have been infected is more like 70%.  No wonder they have seen a precipitous decline in new cases in both states.  But what about other states?</p>
<p>At the bottom of this web page, you will see a table of all of the states (plus D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.), and their total confirmed cases as a fraction of their total population.  It also has the ratio of the most recent 7 days confirmed cases, to the worst week that state has had in the last 12 weeks (i.e. is it currently declining from its recent peak, or is it setting new record highs in which case it will be at 1.0).  But if you want to look at them all in one graph, to see the overall trend, here it is again:<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/herd_imm_check.png"></p>
<p>Note that, not only are the Dakotas very low (recently), but also all of the states with something like 10% cases per capita, are declining (numbers lower than 1).  In fact, it appears that once a state hits 8%, it will start to have declining numbers of new cases each week.  If 8% confirmed cases means something more like 48% of population having been already infected with the virus, this is not too surprising.</p>
<h2>Does This Mean It's Too Late For The Vaccine?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on what you think the vaccine is for.  If you think it is to end the current pandemic, and we were all hiding out so that we would not get infected until the vaccine showed up, then yes, I'm afraid it means that the vaccine is probably showing up just too late to help with that (especially if you have to get both doses before you are immune).  If you live in a state like Hawaii, Maine, or Vermont, with a total confirmed cases far below the levels of the Dakotas, then perhaps the vaccine may save some people even in this pandemic.  Given that all of these states are experiencing record or near-record levels of new confirmed cases, though, I have my doubts.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that currently North and South Dakota are two of the top three states in getting the vaccine rolled out.  However, since they have only gotten about 5% of the population (and that's counting people who have only gotten one dose), I doubt that it is the main factor driving the recent decline.  But it sure doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>But vaccines developed in response to a new virus have never showed up in time to help much with the first pandemic, so that is not really a knock on the people who developed these.  We have had measles, mumps, rubella, etc. for many decades, and we still have to get vaccinated, because even though there's no pandemic of those three currently (knock on wood), we know they are still out there, and will eventually return.  Vaccines help us to avoid repeating this whole pandemic every 20 years or so (for every virus), once there are enough people born after the last wave to provide "fresh fuel" for the fire.  Given how stupid and crazy this pandemic has made people, I think we can all be thankful for that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>I have come to the conclusion that <em>Software Engineering is primarily a learning endeavour, the working code is rather a side effect</em>.</p>
<p>This quote is actually not mine but I am paraphrasing Alberto Brandolini who is making this very point in <a href="https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming">Event Storming</a> (he was actually talking about Software Development, but I do not want to get into an academic discussion on the differences between Software <em>Engineering</em> and <em>Development</em> and I am treating them as being equal here).</p>
<p>I have actually always been thinking of Software Engineering (SE) as a learning process, but it was only until I read Brandolinins <em>Event Storming</em> where I found this view expressed in such clarity, which also made it clear to me that I, myself have been seeing SE in this very way. In short: for any non-trivial SE project, the main challenge is understanding the domain, which is primarily a learning process. This view is also very prominent in the Domain-Driven Design community and was expressed by Eric Evans himself: <em>The critical complexity of most software projects is in understanding the domain itself.</em></p>
<p>It is no surprise that agile processes have been proven to be so successful and useful: they emphasise <strong>collective learning</strong>. What is even better is that agile is a very scientific approach to SE: we fornulate hypotheses from discussions (among developers <strong>and</strong> customer) and then test them in experiments to arrive at new insights and deeper understanding. Plan-based processes on the other hand are a rather inductive aproach, based on many assumptions which are not tested and verified until the very end (just ask yourself: would you approach your Ph.D. in that way?)</p>
<p>When we finally acknowledge that SE is a learning process then we need to structure the methodologies, processes, tools and technologies around it to create an environment where quick, shared learning can happen through continuous experimentation and feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight requirements allowing for quick understanding of the domain and what and why to implement for whom: <em>Impact Maps (Godzic), Event Storming (Brandolini), User Stories, User Story Mapping (Patton)</em>.</li>
<li>A lightweight development and engineering process with emphasis on collective learning through continuous feedback: Agile / <em>Scrum</em> with <em>eXtreme Programming</em> (XP) practices.</li>
<li>A suitable design methodology which emphasises collective learning and experiments: <em>Domain-Driven Design</em></li>
<li>The most suitable architecture for the problem at hand, found by applying careful prototyping.</li>
<li>A programming language which makes it easier to map the domain into code: object-oriented, something along <em>Java, C#</em>,… (I am actually going to do research on using Haskell for that, but that is a topic for another post)</li>
<li>Technology which lets developers focus on the learning of the domain instead of dealing with low-level plumbing: <em>Spring, Thymeleaf, REST, React/Angular/Vue/…, Hibernate, Web, Mobile, IDEs</em>,…</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my firm belief that learning SE requires to apply it in the same way as learning a programming language requires us to apply it. Yes, when learning how to program we have books and slides and lecture notes describing the language and concepts but they always come with exercises. It is a mystery to me how we can write SE books which ignore that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the SE textbooks I have read and studied (I had a fair share of them…) seems to embrace all of the above in any deeper way, and just throws a checklist of the usual topics at the reader in a rather very academic, dry and boring way. These books seem to treat SE simply as a collection of methodologies, processes, tools and technologies as a means to an end in itself which need to be applied <em>somehow</em>. A student who works through them has acquired lot of book knowledge about SE but has no clue how to <strong>really</strong> put it together and how the knowledge <strong>really</strong> relates to real-world SE. Even worse, the idea that SE is a learning process is not communicated in any of the SE textbooks I know. I think one of the main reason this is the case is that all these books have been written a long time ago and have only been extended with “newer” topics such as Agile / Web / Cloud / Whatever but have been sticking to the same end 90s/early 2000s SE mindset (just think about it: <em>Sommerville</em> is in its 10th edition now…),</p>
<p>Therefore, it is my aim to write a textbook book on applied, modern SE which is going to embrace all discussed issues above - I feel it is a very much needed textbook. It will be based on my teaching experience from my SE course at the FHV, paired with real-world experience from myself and industry partners. At the moment it is just a vision in my head but I want to get into it as soon as possible. Uunfortunately not before Spring 2022 as I will be occupied with a heavy load of teaching until then but this will give me enough time to earn more experience in teaching SE and reflecting my approach to the book which I will share in future posts.</p>

<h2><span id="The_problem_with_writing_advice">The problem with writing advice</span></h2>



<p>The problem with the likes of Steven Pinker and Helen Sword is that they like their own writing way too much. But I don’t. Like their writing, that is. [1] I want to get some information from them and I want to get examples and counterexamples for the points they make. I want them to get to the point. I am not reading them for enjoyment, that’s what fiction is for. I am reading them to learn what they have to say and I have to wade through a morass of stories, pointless metaphors, geysers of words. They are aiming for eloquence but effluence would be a better term for what their reader gets.</p>



<p>Of course, they get high praise and esteem from their peers, everybody wants to write like Pinker, Gladwell or Sword. And obviously many people buy and read their books. So they must be doing something right. But my claim is that they focus far too much of crafting their sentences and far too little time on crafting their advice.</p>



<p>And what’s worse, they promote an environment where ‘writing well’ with style or panache is seen as a virtue. People are praised for that sort of writing and others are encouraged to emulate them. Sentences like “This was so well written, why can’t more academics write like this” proliferate. But it misidentifies the problem. When academic writing is bad, it is not because of the opacity of prose but rather because of the paucity of scrupulous argumentation.</p>



<h2><span id="Defending_academic_writing">Defending academic writing</span></h2>



<p>The complaint that academic writing is needlessly dense and abstruse has become a cliche and gets far too little examination. Nobody (except many frustrated readers) is officially complaining that non-fiction writing is needlessly flowery and sprawling across many more pages than necessary. It prides itself on taking the reader on a journey of discovery but it’s actually all smoke and mirrors.</p>



<p>There is only one criterion that we should require of academic writing and that is the same requirement we should have of academic thinking. Scruples. Scrupulous writing will let the reader in on the uncertainty of knowledge, and messiness of the process of how knowledge is created. It will not try to write a press-release while presenting its argument. And it will not waste the reader’s time by taking them on a journey. Starting every single point it wants to make with a story!</p>



<h2><span id="Starting_with_academic_reading">Starting with academic reading</span></h2>



<p>Academic writing needs to start with the recognition of what academic reading looks like. The vast majority of academic writing is not read like fiction or popular non-fiction. It is read to get the piece of information one needs or to get a gist of what the overall point is. So, having a clear outline with descriptive titles would be much more important than removing unnecessary adverbs. Having an abstract that summarises the key points made in bullet points helps more than using active verbs. Using vocabulary appropriate to the needs of the audience is much more useful than trying to avoid jargon or acronyms.</p>



<p>The first advice you need to give to an academic writer is not to read a book on stylish writing but rather to read how people in their field are writing. Because those are their potential readers. And in their writing, we see what they are expecting. So anything written in the manner they expect will make reading easier for them. Because there is no academic writing as such, there is only writing within disciplines and communities. And barging into a community and trying to change what it’s doing without invitation is not stylish, it is rude. [2]</p>



<p>Why are people reading and why are people writing? They are reading to discover the argument that the author is putting forward. And they are writing to put debate the arguments of others and to put forth more of their own. Their success in doing so should be our primary criterion. The success of academic writing is not some abstract readability score but the ability of the peers to identify and debate the argument it puts forward. [3]</p>



<h2><span id="Practical_advice_on_composition_Shorter_sentences">Practical advice on composition: Shorter sentences</span></h2>



<p>This is where we can give some practical advice. And the advice can be summarised in 3 words: 1. Write 2. shorter 3. sentences. Ignore everything about passives, jargon, conversational writing, whatever else the latest guide puts forward. Focus on keeping your average sentence to about 15 words. Not every sentence has to be that short but if you keep the average somewhere between 15 and 20 words, your writing will be easier to read.</p>



<p>Keeping sentences short is not only good for the reader, it is also good for the writer. Often a long sentence means muddled thought. If I find a sentence I wrote that’s longer than say 30 words, I often also find that the thought behind it is not clear enough. I had an idea in my mind that had too many assumptions and I had not put enough work into parsing out all the connections.</p>



<p>But not always, sometimes a longer sentence is better for both the writer and the reader. Text that is easy to understand is cohesive as well as coherent and too many short clauses will lack cohesion. The reader needs to know which things link together and making that explicit will make the text better.</p>



<p>The good news is that sentence length is easy to check without having to learn opaque grammatical concepts. We know that <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html">people most exercised about passives</a> are least likely to actually spot them in the sentence. So why should we expect normal writers to pay attention to parts of speech or fine details of sentence structure. But anybody can paste their text into the free <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Writer</a> and see if they can shorten the sentences highlighted in red.[4] Doing it regularly will also give you a chance to focus on how sentences are put together.</p>



<h2><span id="Structure_is_king_Rich_outlines">Structure is king: Rich outlines</span></h2>



<p>If you really care about your readers, make sure you make the outline of your writing explicit. Don’t just mark the normal sections like: Introduction or Conclusions. That is helpful for navigation but not understanding. Put headings inside these sections and have them every few paragraphs to summarise what you’re trying to say in those paragraphs. This will aid readers who are not reading your text in sequence to get the gist and also not to miss important points.</p>



<p>You may complain about the youths today not spending enough time on deep reading, but paradoxically, if the structure is marked clearly enough, people are likely to read more of the actual text, as well, because it breaks the work into smaller chunks. Particularly students or novices are often horrified by the walls and walls of undifferentiated texts they are asked to climb. Dividing it into smaller, labelled chunks makes the text more approachable and more likely to be read.</p>



<p>This rich outlining can be done while planning your writing, during writing or during revision. I often don’t start with an outline because I’m not yet clear on exactly what I want to say. But I always create an outline at some point. It helps me discover all the missing and inconsistent bits that are so easy to miss in an extended narrative.</p>



<p>And, finally, if you have an outline, share it with the reader. Put it at the top of the text. It could be a table of contents or just a list of bullets. Better still, put it in the abstract. It is infuriating, reading an abstract that says what the paper tries to show and not what it actually showed. [4]</p>



<h2><span id="All_you_need">All you need</span></h2>



<p>And that’s it, clear explicit structure and moderately shorter sentences. No stories, no metaphors, no flourishes. No avoidance of passives or reduction of adverbs. No worries about technical language. Just these two. They will not only make the academic writing easier to read, they will also make it more scrupulous.</p>



<h2><span id="Self-criticism">Self-criticism</span></h2>



<p>Do I write as I say? Not always and not always perfectly. Some of my sentences do get long and my composition tends to the flowery. For example, the sentence about the importance of shorter sentences is the longest one of this post at 43 words. I thought about breaking it up but I liked its rhythm, so I left it. But my average sentence is 14 words and this makes the overall readability higher.</p>



<p>But that is the lot of anyone who writes about writing. The more strident your strictures, the more likely you are to <a href="https://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/168">fall afoul of them</a>.</p>



<h2><span id="Notes">Notes</span></h2>



<p><strong>[1]</strong> For those who do not routinely read books on writing. The title of the post refers to a book by Steven Pinker “The Sense of Style” which is a lot to wade through for not very much useful advice. The other book I complain about is Helen Sword’s “Stylish Academic Writing”, which overall has better and more actionable advice than Pinker. But the problem with Sword is that many of the examples she sets out to change actually don’t need changing that much. And the examples she singles out for praise are questionable.</p>



<p><strong>[2]</strong> The advice about how important it is pay attention about the language of the community you’re writing for is best summarised by Larry McEnerney in his talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&amp;list=PLEl9d2qvKkBslX4kb0bG2mWmiSKYDGBdC&amp;index=3">Writing beyond the academy</a>.</p>



<p><strong>[3]</strong> The importance of thinking about your writing as communicating with interested peers is often made by Thomas Basbøll) on his <a href="https://blog.cbs.dk/inframethodology/">blog Inframethodology</a>. But it is also the core of the argument of this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25653028?seq=1">paper by Cathy Birkenstein defending Judith Butler</a> against the charge of incomprehensibility.</p>



<p><strong>[4]</strong> The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> also tries to identify passives and adverbs. Feel free to entirely ignore its advice. Also, it computes a readability score which is useful. But all it does is count letters in words and words in sentences. It is easy to game just by randomly inserting periods through out the text. ****</p>

<p>This is a video abstract of our paper published in <em>Current Opinions in Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Obesity</em> in 2020:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Ketogenic_diet_as_a_metabolic_treatment_for_mental.99261.aspx">https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Ketogenic_diet_as_a_metabolic_treatment_for_mental.99261.aspx</a>. </p>



<p>Summary:  Psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and binge eating disorder, are neurometabolic diseases that share several common mechanistic biopathologies. These include glucose hypometabolism, neurotransmitter imbalances,&nbsp;oxidative stress&nbsp;and&nbsp;inflammation. There is strong evidence that ketogenic diets can address these four fundamental diseases, and now complementary clinical evidence that ketogenic diets can improve the patients’ symptoms.</p>

         <span>15 Jan 2021</span> - <i></i>

        <p>“Never check secrets into source control” is one of those <em>rules</em> that are 100%
correct, until it’s not. There are no universal laws in software, and recently
I had a reason to break this one. I checked AWS keys into a Git repository. I
then pushed those commits to a <em>public</em> repository on GitHub. I did this
<strong>intentionally</strong>, and lived to tell the tale. You almost certainly should
never do this, so I thought I would share what happens when you do.</p>

<p>I can imagine you thinking: “this guy posted his AWS credentials on purpose? He
must be an idiot.” I don’t disagree with your conclusion, but just let me
explain!</p>

<p>My use-case is pretty simple: the
<a href="https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs">delta-rs</a> project needed a real S3
bucket to do some integration testing. I decided to set up a real S3 bucket for
our (read-only) integration tests. Fortunately our tests just needed to
retrieve objects from a bucket to confirm that an S3 bucket is presenting
itself as a Delta table properly. I would have <em>never</em> done this if we needed
“write” operations on the bucket.</p>

<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>

<p>AWS has an integral access control framework called IAM, not to be confused
with an anagram of “AMI” which <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig">Corey Quinn</a> can
help you learn how to pronounce. IAM allows crafting policies and roles for
just about everything in AWS a dozen or more different ways. It slices, it
dices, it keeps your buckets safe. It is also configured with JSON, which is
awful, but I’ll have to save those rantings for another blog post. Anyways,
here’s the read-only policy that I set up for the bucket:</p>

<p>I also set up an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/">AWS
Budget</a> to alert me
should this start to ever cost real money. My currently monthly costs in this
AWS account are almost $1.50, so my budget is set such that if/when this
starts costing me more than a couple of dollars a month, AWS will email me so I
can figure out what to do in order to save my snapple money.</p>

<p>Finally, I created an IAM user for the integration tests. This IAM user has a
single IAM policy attached to it, listed out above. I then took the AWS access
key and secret key ID for the IAM user and checked those into Git.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2021-01-19 update:</strong> An anonymous reader points out:</p>

<p><em>Certain AWS APIs cannot be disabled via IAM, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html">including
<code>sts:GetCallerIdentify</code></a>
which in turn allows anyone with the public credentials to run the AWS
equivalent of <code>whoami</code>:</em></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>AWS account numbers and IAM user ARNs are not especially privileged but be
aware that publishing access keys has a side effect of disclosing those too.</em></p>

<p>After preparing the integration tests, I pushed <a href="https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/pull/63">my pull
request</a> at <strong>13:05 PST</strong>. When
pushing code to GitHub, anything that looks like an AWS access key is
immediately identified by robots around the world, most of them
malicious in intent, but a few designed to help developers like me who make silly mistakes.</p>

<p>At <strong>13:05:36 PST</strong>, an AWS Support Case was opened in my account:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear AWS customer,</p>

  <p>We have become aware that the AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH, belonging to IAM User deltars-ro, along with the corresponding Secret Key is publicly available online at https://github.com/rtyler/delta.rs/blob/b3581ee06eee26d971bd3b76bb788c85ecf0c6c0/rust/tests/s3_test.rs .</p>

  <p>Your security is important to us and this exposure of your account’s IAM credentials poses a security risk to your AWS account, could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity, and violates the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of our Services.</p>

  <p>To protect your account from excessive charges and unauthorized activity, we have applied the “AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine” AWS Managed Policy (“Quarantine Policy”) to the IAM User listed above. The Quarantine Policy applied to the User protects your account by limiting permissions for high risk AWS services.
You can view the policy by going here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine$jsonEditor?section=permissions .</p>

  <p>For your security, DO NOT remove the Quarantine Policy before following the instructions below. In cases where the Quarantine Policy is causing production issues you may detach the policy from the user. NOTE: Only users with admin privileges or with access to iam:DetachUserPolicy may remove the policy. For instructions on how to remove managed policies go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#remove-policies-console . In the event of the unauthorized use of your AWS account, we may, at our sole discretion, provide you with concessions. However, a failure to follow the instructions below may jeopardize your ability to receive a concession.</p>

  <p>If you believe you’ve received this note in error, please contact us immediately via the support case.</p>

  <p>PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT:</p>

  <p>Step 1: Delete or rotate the exposed AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH. To delete IAM User Keys go to your AWS Management Console here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users . To delete Root User Keys go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential .</p>

  <p>If your application uses the exposed Access Key, you need to replace the Key. To replace the Key, first create a second Key (at that point both Keys will be active) and then modify your application to use the new Key.
Then disable (but do not delete) the exposed Key by clicking on the “Make inactive” option in the console. If there are any problems with your application, you can reactivate the exposed Key. When your application is fully functional using the new Key, please delete the exposed Key.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Only rotating or deleting the exposed Key may not be sufficient to protect your account, see Step 2.</p>

  <p>Step 2: Check your CloudTrail log for unsanctioned activity such as the creation of unauthorized IAM users, policies, roles or temporary security credentials. To secure your account please delete any unauthorized IAM users, roles and policies, and revoke any temporary credentials.</p>

  <p>To delete unauthorized IAM User, navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users . To delete unauthorized policies go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies . To delete unauthorized roles go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles  .</p>

  <p>Unauthorized temporary credentials may have been created for the IAM User deltars-ro with the exposed AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH. You can revoke temporary credentials by following instructions outlined here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_disable-perms.html#denying-access-to-credentials-by-issue-time . Temporary credentials can also be revoked by deleting the IAM User. NOTE: Deleting IAM Users may impact production workloads and should be done with care.</p>

  <p>Step 3: Check your CloudTrail log to review your AWS account for any unauthorized AWS usage, such as unauthorized EC2 instances, Lambda functions or EC2 Spot bids. You can also check usage by logging into your AWS Management Console and reviewing each service page. The “Bills” page in the Billing console can also be checked for unexpected usage. https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill</p>

  <p>Please keep in mind that unauthorized usage can occur in any region and that your console may show you only one region at a time. To switch between regions, you can use the dropdown in the top-right corner of the console screen.</p>

  <p>Please take steps to prevent any new credentials from being publicly exposed. See Best Practices of Managing your Access Keys at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html .</p>

<p>Most people, I imagine, grab whatever's cheapest, or closest, or whatever they <em>always</em> use. But if you're scrupulous enough to ask Google for the best painkiller, here's how your friendly neighborhood tech behemoth would answer:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--692ad5fb57e820714ca1dc70e3b05260aae65913/image-1601262407690.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>Oh thanks Google that's just <em>all of them</em>.</p>

<p>If you're among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/02/01/majority-of-adults-look-online-for-health-information/">77% of Americans</a> that Google their health problems, insipid answers like this won't surprise you. But we should be surprised, because researchers carry out <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e008932">tens of thousands</a> of clinical trials every year. And hundreds of clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of painkillers. So why can't I Google those results?</p>

<p>And so in the year of our lord 2017 I had a <strong>Brilliant Startup Idea</strong>: use a structured database of clinical trials to provide simple, practical answers to common medical questions.</p>

<p>As a proof-of-concept I tried this by hand: I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIx25J54JifJ8qliGnMBlKWn3PdB5sn852blOBfKfJk/">spreadsheet</a> with every OTC painkiller trial I could find and used <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to run a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386629/">network meta-analysis</a>, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-016-0715-4">gold standard</a> of evidence-based medicine.</p>

<p>The results were pretty interesting, and <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing I was looking for back in the sad sterile aisles of CVS:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b560c1e2bdbe33d8ddd1f10436432d3658d62c1b/image-1601347817059.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>A wave of exhiliration washed over me. Here was a problem that</p>

<ol>
<li>Was interesting</li>
<li>Could help people</li>
<li>I knew how to solve</li>
</ol>

<p>A perfect bullseye. After a few hours searching domains I came up with a name for my project: <strong>GlacierMD</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the next nine months I would quit my job, write over 200,000 lines of code, hire five contractors, create a Delaware C-Corp, add four doctors to my advisory board, and demo GlacierMD for twelve Bay Area medical practices. I would spend $40K of my own savings buying clinical trials and paying contractors to enter said trials into the GlacierMD database.</p>

<p>On July 2, 2018, GlacierMD powered the world's largest depression meta-analysis, using data from 846 trials, beating <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext">Cipriani's previous record</a> of 522.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f65968deef4b6b7b836a90d2eee15119b5583f8c/image-1601347863747.jpg" alt="GlacierMD's evidence graph for depression treatments."></p>

<p>Choirs of angels sang in my ears. Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.</p>

<p>Two weeks later GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<hr>

<div><p><span>"T</span>hat's an awesome idea," said Carl. "It sounds like something worth working on."
</p><p>
Carl was my boss. We worked at a startup that leveraged autonomous blockchains to transfer money from naïve investors to slightly less naïve twenty-somethings. There are worse gigs.</p></div>

<p>And here was Carl telling me that my startup idea would bring such benefit to humanity that I simply <em>had</em> to quit, his roadmap be damned. I nodded knowingly, feeling the weight of this responsibility resting on my proud shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thanks Carl," I said. "I'll try to mention you when I accept my Nobel."</p>

<p>I quit two weeks later and started coding at a blistering pace. I drew all sorts of inscrutable diagrams with dry-erase pens on my parents' windows. I hired a motley crew of Egyptian contractors to start entering clinical trials into my database. I commissioned a logo, registered my domain, and started obsessing over color schemes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--da9ab4b5da5f08cc26afe10e0531b89321ff5a24/image-1601347898563.jpg" alt="Data extraction portal for GlacierMD"></p>

<p>When I finally finished the MVP I showed it to the head of product at the company I'd just left. I watched him as he watched my demo, waiting for his eyes to melt with the glory of it all. Instead he just sorta shrugged.</p>

<p>"Lots of people make medical claims on the internet," he said. "Why should I trust yours?"</p>

<p>I started babbling about network meta-analyses, statistical power, and p-values, but he cut me off.</p>

<p>"Yeah okay that's great but nobody cares about this math crap. You need doctors."</p>

<p>Goddamnit he was right. If nobody could be bothered with the math, then I was no better than Gwyneth Paltrow hawking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45426332">vagina eggs</a>. To build trust I needed to get endorsements from trustworthy people.</p>

<p>So I called up some friends, some buddies, some friends-of-friends. "Would you like to be an advisor for my cutting-edge health-tech startup?" I'd ask, while eating Dominos in my parents' laundry room. I'd give them 1% of this extermely valuable, high-growth startup and in exchange I could plaster their faces all over my website.</p>

<p>Four of these doctors agreed. This is called <em>making deals</em> ladies and gentlemen and I was like the lovechild of Warren Buffet and Dr. Oz.</p>

<p>Things are going great. My friends and family all tell me they love the site. Even some strangers on the internet love it. "I know right," I tell them. "So how much would you pay for this?"</p>

<p>"Hahahahahahah," they say in unison. "Good one!"</p>

<p>I forgot that the the first law of consumer tech is <em>nobody pays for consumer tech</em>. But no problemo, I say to myself. This is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> invented ads. I'll just plaster a few banners on GlacierMD and <em>bing bang boom</em> I'll be <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/">seasteading</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a> before <a href="https://burningman.org/">Burning Man</a>.</p>

<p>But then I look at WebMD's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326583/000119312517247147/d391943d10q.htm">10-Qs</a> and start to spiral. Turns out the world's biggest health website makes about $0.50/year <em>per user</em>. That is...not enough money to bootstrap GlacierMD. I'm pouring money into my rent, into my Egyptian contractors, into AWS—I need some cash soon.</p>

<p>What I need are people willing to pay for this thing. What about doctors? Doctors have money, right? Maybe doctors, or practices, or whatever—someone in the medical industry—maybe they would shell out some cash for my on-demand meta-analyses.</p>

<p>So I listened to a few podcasts and became a sales expert. I started cold calling people using scripts from the internet and tried to convince them to sit through a GlacierMD demo.</p>

<p>In the meantime I receive some worrying messages from my Egyptian contractors.</p>

<p>"I think it's time to talk about a raise," one of them says.</p>

<p>"I feel that I have become exceptional at my job," says another. "Please consider a raise or I will stop working."</p>

<p>"Please increase my pay," says the third, including helpful screenshots demonstrating how to give said raise through the Upwork website.</p>

<p><em>Are my contractors unionizing?</em> I wonder. I glance obliquely at my shrinking bank account statement, grit my teeth, and approve the raises. At this rate I'll hit zero in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>But my sales calls start paying off. Miraculously I find some doctors that are willing to talk to me. So I borrow my parents' car and drive out to the burbs to meet a doctor I'll call Susan.</p>

<p>Susan has a small practice in downtown Redwood City, a Silicon Valley town that looks 3-D printed from the Google Image results for <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=main+street&amp;tbm=isch">main street</a></em>.</p>

<p>Susan is a bit chatty (she's a psychiatrist) but eventually I demo GlacierMD. I show her how you can filter studies based on the demographic data of the patient, how you can get treatment recommendations based on a preferred side effect profile, how you can generate a dose-response curve. She <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em> at all the right points. By the end of the interview she's practically drooling.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--927e2748d8adb987b5d491746fcbb3691f186d1b/image-1601347948152.jpg" alt="Comparing the efficacy of two antidepressants over time"></p>

<p><em>Hook, line, and sinker</em> I think to myself. I'm already contemplating what color <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/">Away bags</a> would look best in the back of my <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> when Susan interrupts my train of thought.</p>

<p>"What a fun project!" she says enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Something in her tone makes me pause. "Uh, yeah," I say. "So what would you imagine a product like this—one that could change the very <em>practice</em> of medicine—how much would you pay for such a service?"</p>

<p>"Oh, uh—hmmmm," she said. "I don't know if we can spare the budget here, to be honest. It's very fun...but I'm not sure if our practice can justify this cost."</p>

<p>If you read enough sales books most of them tell you that when people say your product is <em>too expensive</em> what they really mean is your product <em>isn't valuable enough</em>. Susan acted like I was offering her Nirvana as a Service so the conversation has taken quite a wild turn.</p>

<p>"So you don't think this product is useful?"</p>

<p>"Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I'll just prescribe what I normally do, since I'm comfortable with it. But you know it's possible that sometimes I'll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies."</p>

<p>"And that isn't worth something? Prescribing better treatments?"</p>

<p>"Hmmmm," she said, picking at her fingernails. "Not directly. Of course I always have the best interests of my patients in mind, but, you know, it's not like they'll pay more if I prescribe Lexapro instead of Zoloft. They won't come back more often or refer more friends. So I'd sorta just be, like, <em>donating</em> this money if I paid you for this thing, right?"</p>

<p>I had literally nothing to say to that. It had been a bit of a working assumption of mine over the past few weeks that if you could improve the health of the patients then, you know, the doctors or the hospitals or whatever would pay for that. There was this giant thing called <em>healthcare</em> right, and its main purpose is <em>improving health</em>—trillions of dollars are spent trying to do this. So if I built a thing that improves health someone should pay me, right?</p>

<p>I said goodbye to Susan and tried to cheer myself up. I had ten more meetings with doctors all over the Bay Area—surely not all of them were ruthless capitalists like Susan. Maybe they would see the the towering genius of GlacierMD and shell out some cash.</p>

<p>But in fact everyone gave me some version of Susan's answer. "We just can't justify the cost," a pediatrician told me. "I'm not sure it's in the budget," said a primary care physician. "It's awesome," said a hospitalist. "You should try to sell this!" <em>Ugh</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><span>S</span>o in July 2018, nine months and $40K after starting GlacierMD, I shut it down. I fired my contractors, archived the database, and shut down the servers. GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<p><em>Make something people want</em>. It's Y-Combinator's motto and a maxim of aspiring internet entrepreneurs. The idea is that if you build something truly awesome, you'll figure out a way to make some money off of it.</p>

<p>So I built something people wanted. Consumers wanted it, doctors wanted it, <em>I</em> wanted it. Where did I go wrong?</p>

<p>Occassionally I like to disconnect from the IV drip of internet …</p></div></div>

January 18, 2021 | https://timdaub.github.io/2021/01/16/web-principles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2021/01/16/web-principles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2>
<p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the front end development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able to push our application's directory structure on a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW! That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these old applications now, our technical visions didn't end up becoming reality.</p>
<p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demo app, I particularly like using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</code></a>. I love <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact's "no build tools route."</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that's frustrating. Using preact's no build route, finally something like the above is possible:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>import</span> { h, Component, render } <span>from</span> <span>'https://unpkg.com/preact?module'</span>;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> app = h(<span>'h1'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello World!'</span>);</span><br><span>  render(app, <span>document</span>.body);</span><br><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they come preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it's merely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that's promising as it assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that build step.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2>
<p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling. It's not because I don't like ESNext features, but more because I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don't use Typescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stopped using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, I found an excellent library called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript's template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it's not breaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2>
<p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don't feel comfortable or inclined. For example, I never switched to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecycle methods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issues with my sites' performance. I would make the switch if I started to have problems. But I don't. The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I'm already productive with the one I use?</p>
<h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2>
<p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive. But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly write front end tests. Finally, we're able to distinguish between functional code and presentational code. For functional code, we now write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I'm pleased about tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integration tests. I also like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2>
<p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the more features, the better. I'm not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build's size. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn on compression and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps by using tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2>
<p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debugging other people's code. Mainly when it's third-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer's superpower. Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p>
<p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens' principles for writing good code</a>. I "use my own work." Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won't roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It's not to say that I ditch every npm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p>
<p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to my advantage.</h2>
<p>I'm building websites since I'm a teenager. And had I open-sourced and maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I'd be more productive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn't think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age 😂</p>
<p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech, fairness or certain politics. They're still important virtues for me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p>
<p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user's perspective. It means I'm able to think about a piece of code's interfaces emphatically. Additionally, there's positive peer pressure. I'm not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it's going to have a proper README and some docs. And it's going to be tested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's my incomplete list of principles. I'm sure there's more than just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial. I'm sure they won't work for everyone as all our contexts differ. But working solo as a freelancer, I've found that these principles contribute to me being content about what I'm doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and see if they've taken similar paths. Please reach out! Also, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>

          <p>Hey fellow E-Ink enthusiats,</p>
<p>many of you might have heard form the recent Clubhouse buzz. It’s a audio-only social network and got quite a lot of attention in the past months:</p>


<p>I have tried it today for the first time and I’m blown away by the awesome user experience. So how is this related to eink? Well, especially in COVID times we are having more and more screen time and new issues like <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychological-exploration-zoom-fatigue">zoom Fatigue</a> and the like appear. E-ink is (at least partially) about improving the screen ergonomics and healthier display tech for eye strain reduction and eye comfort.</p>
<p>But why not bring this to a new level and have more “audio-only” applications. I could see more work flows being without display. The classical example is a phone call, but it’s more and more coming with WhatsApp audio messages, voice to speek recogntion and the like.</p>
<p>What is the next Clubhouse for X?</p>


<p>Can you imagine having more screen workflows being “screenless”. I think it’s even more natural to use voice and audio than just typing into a screen. Or even better to combine voice, audio and eink. What would be the best ergonomic working station? Eventually even use AI to optimize further?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <p>A <em><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.census.gov%2F2011%2F07%2F20%2Fwhat-are-census-blocks%2F&amp;t=ZDk3YjI4YjkzYWMzN2M4ODcyNzZmMjRiNDA5NGRkNmU1MzQ0Y2JkYix4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">Block</a></em> is the smallest area unit used by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating statistics. As of the 2010 census, the United States consists of 11,078,300 Census Blocks. Of them, 4,871,270 blocks totaling 4.61 million square kilometers were reported to have no population living inside them. Despite having a population of more than 310 million people, 47 percent of the USA remains unoccupied.</p><p>Green shading indicates unoccupied Census Blocks. A single inhabitant is enough to omit a block from shading.</p><p><strong>Update Jan 2015</strong>: <a href="http://tumblr.mapsbynik.com/post/107762841792/nobody-lives-here-map-prints-available">Prints and canvas of the Nobody Live Here map</a> are now available.</p><p><em>Update 2014.05.01</em>: I’ve received a couple questions about Canada.  Just to be clear, this map is of the United States only. It is based on 2010 data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, which for reasons I hope are apparent, does not include data on our friends in the Great White North. For a similar depiction of Canada, see <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSrefoUG.jpg&amp;t=OGIyYmM2NzUxMDViZjU3YWVjNzQzMDMzNTk1Njg4Nzk2YWNhMGI4NCx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">this map</a> whipped up by Michael Chung.</p><h2>Map observations</h2><p>The map tends to highlight two types of areas:</p><ul><li>places where human habitation is physically restrictive or impossible, and</li><li>places where human habitation is prohibited by social or legal convention.</li></ul><p>Water features such lakes, rivers, swamps and floodplains are revealed as places where it is hard for people to live. In addition, the mountains and deserts of the West, with their hostility to human survival, remain largely void of permanent population.</p><p>Of the places where settlement is prohibited, the most apparent are wilderness protection and recreational areas (such as national and state parks) and military bases. At the national and regional scales, these places appear as large green tracts surrounded by otherwise populated countryside.</p><p>At the local level, city and county parks emerge in contrast to their developed urban and suburban surroundings. At this scale, even major roads such as highways and interstates stretch like ribbons across the landscape.</p><p>Commercial and industrial areas are also likely to be green on this map. The local shopping mall, an office park, a warehouse district or a factory may have their own Census Blocks. But if people don’t live there, they will be considered “uninhabited”. So it should be noted that just because a block is unoccupied, that does not mean it is undeveloped.</p><p>Perhaps the two most notable anomalies on the map occur in Maine and the Dakotas. Northern Maine is conspicuously uninhabited. Despite being one of the earliest regions in North America to be settled by Europeans, the population there remains so low that large portions of the state’s interior have yet to be politically organized.</p><p>In the Dakotas, the border between North and South appears to be unexpectedly stark. Geographic phenomena typically do not respect artificial human boundaries. Throughout the rest of the map, state lines are often difficult to distinguish. But in the Dakotas, northern South Dakota is quite distinct from southern North Dakota. This is especially surprising considering that the county-level population density on both sides of the border is about the same at less than 10 people per square mile.</p><p><em>Update</em>: On a more detailed examination of those two states, I’m convinced the contrast here is due to differences in the sizes of the blocks. North Dakota’s blocks are more consistently small (StDev of 3.3) while South Dakota’s are more varied in area (StDev of 9.28). West of the Missouri River, South Dakota’s blocks are substantially larger than those in ND, so a single inhabitant can appear to take up more space. Between the states, this provides a good lesson in how changing the size and shape of a geographic unit can alter perceptions of the landscape.</p><p>Finally, the differences between the eastern and western halves of the contiguous 48 states are particularly stark to me. In the east, with its larger population, unpopulated places are more likely to stand out on the map. In the west, the opposite is true. There, population centers stand out against the wilderness.</p><h2>::</h2><p>Ultimately, I made this map to show a different side of the United States. Human geographers spend so much time thinking about where people are. I thought I might bring some new insight by showing where they are not, adding contrast and context to the typical displays of the country’s population geography.</p><p>I’ve all but scratched the surface of insight available from examining this map. There’s a lot of data here. What trends and patterns do you see?</p><h2>Errata</h2><ul><li>Due to a cartographic mishap, the Gulf of California was missing from the original version. Though it was quickly fixed, that version keeps popping up across the Internet. It displeases me I see it, yet I’m amused that people keep reposting it without noticing the error. The geography gods judge those people harshly.</li><li>Some islands may be missing on the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmapsbynik.com%2Fmaps%2Fcensus0pop%2F&amp;t=NGE5ZGEyN2NjZjVhNjVkY2JlMWIyMjU3MTczZjJlYWY1OTI0OTRhZSx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">hi-res edition</a> if they were not a part of the waterbody data sets I used.</li></ul><h3>::</h3><p>©mapsbynik 2014<br>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line. Write your metadata atomically with your object. Never separate them.</strong><br></p><p>We welcome your comments.

		<p>Privacy is a human right, when so much of our life is lived online. In my opinion, the two most evil companies on the planet with a blatant disregard for privacy because it is so fundamental to their business model are: Facebook (and by extension, WhatsApp and Instagram) and Google. A common argument against the need for privacy that I have definitely heard in my family is “but I have nothing to hide”. Well, neither do I and yet so does everyone. Does anyone really appreciate searching on Google for a vacuum cleaner and then seeing photos of vacuum cleaners follow them around all over the web for months afterwards? But I digress: I made a conscious decision to gradually rid myself of Google (Facebook was easier: just delete the app) to the extent possible.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time researching alternatives to each of Google services, and the list below tabulates what I have settled on. Importantly, I have reached the conclusion that viable (and often superior) alternatives exist. Nothing in life is free: one can pay with one’s privacy or with cash. It is no surprise this that most of these below are paid services. Personally, I am more than happy to support businesses where I know what I am paying for and my data is not being pilfered to create some Frankensteinian advertising profile on me.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://ref.fm/u14223513">Fastmail</a> (email, contacts, and calendar): I have been using their email service for over a year now. They are a privacy-respecting email service based out of Australia. They’ve actually been around for a very long time: I remember a college friend in early 2000s (back when they were Fastmail.fm) showing me a cool feature to send a (fake) <em>email undelivered</em> response to an email. I believe they don’t have have that feature in their present-day incarnation. These days my most-used Fastmail feature is their ability to create an unlimited number of email aliases. I can create a new email address for every untrustworthy website and if I start receiving spam on an alias, not only do I know which website was the culprit behind it, but I can simply delete the alias and move on. Another favorite: the ability to block remote images (and as opposed to delivering them over a proxy server — see HEY below) which makes for a pleasant 90s-like (remember mutt?) text-only webmail interface. They have a high quality iOS app with both email and calendar. The service is mature and it has all standard email features (filters, forwarding, IMAP/POP, 2FA etc.). One situation where Fastmail beats Gmail is the ability to send emails from MATLAB or R, or from a cron script running on my own hosted domain: inevitably, these were rejected as “low quality” on Gmail. Well, I am not too keen on letting an AI make that decision for me. Unlike Gmail, Fastmail doesn’t hold immediate push notifications hostage for the native Mail app either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more difficult task was to then go to all the places where I had signed up my Gmail and then replace that with my Fastmail address.</p>
<p>Yes, I do realize that the moment someone sends me an email from Gmail to my Fastmail (or when I respond to them), I am effectively enabling that same advertising profile. But we have to start somewhere and one can only hope that enough people will switch over from the dark side.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>: I mean, have you looked at Google search results lately? Once upon a time they used to be the 10 blue links company with one prominent and easily-identified, textual advertisement at the top. Contrast that with the situation now: it is impossible to find the organic result one wants amongst a sea of distractions and posers (ads cleverly disguised to resemble results). Admittedly, this Google service was the most difficult to be weaned away from, partly because when I tried DDG in the past, the results were less than spectacular. But I think the tide has turned now: DuckDuckGo is a viable and formidable competitor (remember when Google was just that against Altavista?) with two clear benefits: they have no intention to build an advertising profile on their users and there is a clearly demarcated ad at the top followed by organic search results. I am to understand that their results are based on Bing’s index. I would estimate that my average rate of going to Google when DDG can’t find an answer is 1 in 200, which is remarkable!</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.awstats.org/">AWStats</a>: This was easy. I just removed all Google Analytics code from my own domains. I cannot be, in good conscience, an enabler of that (creating advertising profiles based on which webpages a person visits) which I myself oppose.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>: Again, for someone who is 100% on the Mac/iOS bandwagon this is an easy one to accomplish. Of course, I have 1Blocker installed. The recent builds of Safari have this oddly satisfying Privacy Report where one can see how many of these creepy ad-trackers were blocked on a webpage and sometimes it is truly enlightening as to what the real business mode of some of the “free” websites is. For work, where we still use GSuite, I have isolated Gmail etc., into the Chrome browser. Firefox is an excellent alternative to Safari, especially for those not on Mac/iOS.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a>: A nifty little firewall for macOS to both see which apps are phoning back home (and where) as well as block any culprits from doing so. Bonus: they also sell another app called Micro Snitch that alerts the user whenever the camera or microphone are in use.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Apple Maps</strong>: This one is yet another example of a disappointing v1 that has now matured into a viable alternative. Maps is one area where my transition away from Google’s offerings is <em>not</em> complete: I still use Waze regularly mainly for their crowdsourced annotations (crashes, slowdowns, construction, etc.) which are unmatched on any other maps platform.</p>
<p>7. <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a>: This is definitely the new kid on the block. From the folks at Basecamp who have been writing software and books for over 20 years now, this is their “weird” interpretation of what email should be. It’s a bit pricey, no doubt, but what I did like was that I was able to get an OG email address <em>firstinitial lastname</em> @hey.com. HEY deserves a blog post of its own (coming soon).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have taken the first steps in a journey that is likely to be a thousand miles long. By documenting my experiences here, I hope others can learn about these first-class alternatives.</p>

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In trying to understand how aggression works, as well as aggressive emotions like anger, I decided to go to the animal literature.  Human psychology research is all too prone to being determined by researchers’ preconceptions, and we all have a lot of firsthand experience and personal agendas when it comes to theorizing about human behavior. It’s easier to get some distance when thinking about animals; we have less stake in any particular theory of how animal emotions work.  It’s also easier to set up experimental conditions with animals that would be hard to do ethically with humans, like keeping them in confinement and exposing them to stressors.</p>

<p>What the mammal literature says about aggression is that it splits neatly into discrete types.  Researchers disagree on exactly how many clusters there are, since there are inevitable judgment calls in defining taxonomies. And the pattern is somewhat different depending on species.  But one very consistent finding is that there <em>are</em> qualitatively different types of aggression.  They are governed by different hormones, activated in different situations, and seem to involve different subjective experiences.</p>

<p><strong>“Defensive Aggression”/”Defensive Rage” – Cortisol, Substance P</strong></p>

<p>A certain cluster of behaviors in mammals can be called “defensive aggression”, “affective defense,” or “defensive rage”. These behaviors are reactions to pain or immediate threat, whether that threat comes from a member of the same species, a member of a different species, or an inanimate object.</p>

<p>Defensive aggression is associated with negative emotions like fear and anger. It is aversive; a rat will learn not to push a lever that stimulates its brain in the same region that stimulates defensive aggression.  It is also associated with cortisol (the “stress hormone”), substance P (involved in pain perception), cholecystokinin (associated with panic), all suggesting that it is a reaction to frightening and painful situations.</p>

<p>Defensive aggression in some species seems to involve qualitatively different and “milder” types of attack (less likely to cause injury) than other types of aggression.  It is also prompted by the same types of situations and same regions of brain stimulation associated with fleeing, hiding, and submission signals (like baring the belly to get an opponent to stop attacking.)  And animals engage in defensive aggression reflexively when hurt even when there is no visible attacker; they’ll “attack” inanimate objects or the air, as though “letting off steam”.  Speculatively, these details suggest that defensive aggression is something of a reflexive “lashing out” when an animal is hurt or scared, not very well optimized to injure or intimidate an opponent, and have more in common with other self-preservation behaviors (like fleeing, hiding, or submitting) than with other types of aggression.</p>

<p><em>“Affective Defense”/“Defensive Rage” in Cats</em></p>

<p>“Affective defense” in mammals typically involves flattening of the ears, lowering of the body, drawing in the head, pupillary dilation, piloerection, hissing, and stiffening of the tail. It is triggered by either a conspecific or a member of another species who is perceived to be a threat.[18]</p>

<p>In cats, “defensive rage” behavior includes ear retraction, piloerection, back arching, pupillary dilatation, vocalization, unsheathing of the claws, and paw strike.  It occurs when a cat is threatened by either a member of the same or different species. Stimulating the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is generally a pain center, elicits defensive rage behaviors in cats.[21]</p>

<p>Various compounds associated with pain and stress, as well as acute ethanol intoxication, can affect the “defensive rage” response.</p>

<p>Blocking substance P, a substance involved in pain response, in cats reduces the defensive rage response to stimulation in the medial amygdala and medial hypothalamus.[22]</p>

<p>Ethanol enhances defensive rage responses in cats, while it reduces predatory attacks.[23]</p>

<p>Cholecystokinin, a neuropeptide and digestive hormone which causes nausea and induces panic when administered to humans, potentiates the defensive rage response in cats.[24]</p>

<p>Naloxone reduces the threshold for inducing defensive rage in the cat by brain stimulation; opioid receptor agonists block defensive rage.[57]</p>

<p>Defensive rage in cats appears to be inhibited by the medial hypothalamus.  Medial hypothalamus lesions make cats extremely defensive – they spit and claw in the presence of humans, they’ll run from a dog and fight if attacked.[48]  However, olfactory bulbectomy doesn’t affect defensive aggression in cats.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Dogs</em></p>

<p>The septal region in the brain is involved in inhibiting defensive aggression in dogs.  Septal lesions make dogs more “overexcitable, baring their teeth, and attempting to bite when handled.”[48]</p>

<p><em>Cortisol-Related Aggression in Hamsters</em></p>

<p>Syrian and Siberian hamsters are more aggressive in the winter (short-day condition) than the summer, despite their testes being smaller in the winter.  The increased aggression appears to be mediated by elevated cortisol, downstream of melatonin signaling.  In primates as well, seasonal rises in testosterone don’t always correlate to increased aggression, and exogenous T doesn’t always increase aggression. Just as in male humans, there is no correlation between testosterone levels and aggressive behavior.[33]</p>

<p>However, amygdala lesions suppress shock-induced fighting in hamsters.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Marmosets</em></p>

<p>As with cats and opossums, stimulating the marmoset ventromedial hypothalamus elicits aggressive responses, chiefly short attacks and vocal threats, as well as flight responses.[27]</p>

<p>Female marmosets attack intruders; the magnitude of the aggressive response correlates positively with testosterone level immediately after the attack.[92]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Mice</em></p>

<p>Defensive aggression in mice seems to be inhibited by the septal region of the brain and enhanced by the olfactory bulb, unlike hamsters and gerbils who do not have an olfactory bulb-dependent aggression response.[48]</p>

<p>Mice who have had their olfactory bulb removed do not fight back when attacked or exhibit fighting behavior after electric shocks. Peripheral anosmia does not cause this response, indicating that its effect on aggression is not due exclusively to the fact that it is necessary for smell.[48]</p>

<p>Septal lesions in mice enhance defensiveness; struggling, biting, and escaping.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Rabbits</em></p>

<p>Septal lesions increase defensive responses (like foot thumping) to human experimenters in rabbits.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Rats</em></p>

<p>Defensive biting in rats is different from attack biting; it is usually targeted at the snout, while attacking rats bite their opponent’s back; and defensive biting is seen <em>more</em> often against human hands or tools than against rats.  Defensive biting only occurs during or immediately after the defending animal has been hurt, and only when escape is impossible. Defensive biting also does not involve piloerection, while offensive biting always does.[4]</p>

<p>Defensive aggression is specifically selected against when rats are domesticated.</p>

<p>233 wild-caught rats were selected for “tameness”, that is, lower rates of aggressive behaviors towards human handlers, or “aggression”, that is, higher rates of aggressive behaviors towards human handlers, over 8-10 generations.  [1]</p>

<p>There was no difference in testosterone levels between tame and wild rats of both sexes; however, aggressive rats had significantly higher serum cortisone levels than wild rats, in both sexes.  Aggressive rats had significantly larger startle responses to …</p></article></div>

      <p><em>2019, October 11, 00:16:</em> <br>
I finish the cold frozen pizza that I made hours before but forgot to eat, finally write the report, press submit on the Google security bug submission form, and see the classic, <code>Thanks! We received your report.</code> message. That feeling is hard to beat.</p>

<p>I just submitted a bug, using which, I could simply send a link to someone, and when they click on it and visit my website, I could <strong>steal their YouTube watch history</strong>, the <strong>links to watch all of their unlisted videos</strong>, their <strong>Watch Later playlist</strong>, the list of <strong>videos they’ve liked</strong>, and more. It was pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>How was this possible? Let’s go back in time a little bit.</p>

<p><em>Already made some progress? Skip ahead to <a href="#chapter2" target="_self">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="#chapter3" target="_self">Chapter 3</a>, or <a href="#chapter4" target="_self">Chapter 4</a>!</em></p>

<h4 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: <br>Your special playlists you never created</h4>

<p>This issue requires a little bit of understanding about the inner-workings of YouTube. Most importantly, about these four interesting playlists:</p>

<p>Since YouTube is made up of videos, a bunch of internal stuff in YouTube is made up of <strong>playlists</strong>. Everybody has a few of them, even if they have never created one. I knew about these from previous research I have done (<em>by previous research, I just mean trying every feature and trying to understand how they work</em>), before finding this bug. Let’s look at these playlists one-by-one because they will be important later.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch History playlist:</strong></p>

<p>At the time of finding this bug, every YouTube user had a playlist with the ID <code>HL</code>, which stands for “History List” (I assume). This list contained every video you previously watched on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch Later playlist:</strong></p>

<p>You have probably seen the little <code>clock</code> icon everywhere on YouTube, which when pressed, adds the video to your “Watch Later”. This is also just a special playlist internally, with the ID <code>WL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The Liked Videos playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This is a tricky one. At the time of finding the bug, I was a bit confused about how this works, so I had to use a little bit of guessing. All I knew, that it was constructed by somehow modifying your channel ID, which is a 24 char long string, and can be found by going to your channel page, and looking at the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> <span>channel_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a bit of trial and error, and by looking at the playlists of my testing/personal accounts, I figured out a way to “guess” the special “Liked Videos” playlist. You just had to replace the first 3 characters of the channel ID with <code>LLD</code> or <code>LLB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Liked Videos” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>LLDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>”</span><span>LLBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>And finally, the most important, the Uploads playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This special playlist contains <strong>all of your videos</strong>. It has everything in it, regardless of the video’s privacy setting. So all <code>Public</code>, <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos you have ever uploaded, are in your special “Uploads” playlist.</p>

<p>At the time of finding the bug, the same guessing thing had to be used as for the “Liked Videos” playlist, but this time first 3 characters of the channel ID had to be <code>UUD</code> or <code>UUB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Uploads” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>UUDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>

<p>Or, if you don’t want to do any of that, you can just go to the channel’s page, click the <code>Videos</code> tab, and click <code>Play All</code>. But only if that button is visible, which is unfortunately not always the case.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the details about how these playlists have changed since 2019, and how they work today at the time of writing this post, you can check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/xdavidhu/136c7dfa9247e4883c1e4dc7a77350e6">this Gist I made</a>.</p>

<p>So now you know about these special playlists every YouTube user has. Now, you might think that we should just open for example someone’s “Uploads” playlist like you would open any other playlist, and simply leak all of their unlisted videos:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// how to steal someone's unlisted videos (very easy!!)

1. Open https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=[victims-uploads-playlist]
2. Profit!?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. These playlists are special in another way too, which is that <strong>different users will see different videos in them</strong>. If the channel owner opens his/her “Uploads” playlist, she will see all of her videos, regardless of the privacy setting. If an attacker tries to open the victim’s “Uploads” playlist, <strong>only the <code>Public</code> videos will be shown</strong>, any other <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos the victim has will just not be there.</p>

<p>As an attacker, we can clearly see that these playlists can contain very sensitive information about the users. We would like to steal these. But unfortunately, they seem to be well protected…</p>

<h4 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: <br>The Embedded Player and it’s API</h4>

<p>If you have a website and want to have a little YouTube player inside it, there is an app for that. And it’s called the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube IFrame Player</a>. Embedding this player into your website is quite easy, you just have to copy some HTML code with an <code>iframe</code> tag, and paste it into your site’s source:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-18-the-embedded-youtube-player-told-me-what-you-were-watching-and-more/embedded-player.png" alt="Screenshot of an empty webpage with an embedded YouTube player"></p>

<p>But today websites are rarely that simple, so you might wonder, what if I want to dynamically create a YouTube player with JavaScript? What if I want to automatically pause the video? These problems would seem quite hacky, or even impossible in some cases, due to the rules of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin Policy</a>, and other protections modern browsers provide.</p>

<p>Thankfully, YouTube has a solution for this as well, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube Player API</a>. This API allows you to just add a JS library to your site, and then simply create/modify/control the YouTube players on your site however you’d like, using JavaScript. For example, if you want to pause a video, you can just call <code>player.pauseVideo()</code>.</p>

<p><em>Hm..</em> This is pretty interesting, but how does it work? The answer might be obvious if you have previously worked with cross-origin (iframe) communication. The YouTube player uses the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">PostMessage API</a>, which allows different origins (in our case your site and the YouTube iframe), to send each other little messages over a secure channel. So the YouTube player has a <code>postMessage</code> listener where it listens to commands, and the JS library you put into your site sends messages to it when you want to perform some action, like pausing the video. Actually, the YouTube player is talking a lot, even if you don’t ask it anything. It immediately tells the JS library on your site if anything happens with the player. This makes it possible for your site to add event listeners, which get called when for example the user skips into a currently playing video.</p>

<p>Let’s see a quick example of how this communication works under the hood:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this postMessage is sent from your site to the iframe under the hood when you call “player.playVideo()”</span>
<span>-&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span><span>"</span><span>event</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>command</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>func</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>playVideo</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>args</span><span>"</span><span>:[],</span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>channel</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>widget</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

<span>// the iframe sends a lot of stuff back, here are some examples</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just a reminder, I was often confused about this, but the “under-the-hood” commands I just showed an example of are sent <strong>by your site</strong>. By “under-the-hood”, I just mean that developers usually include YouTube’s library, to make communication easier, and that library simply abstracts the details away, so you can just call <code>pauseVideo()</code>, without worrying about anything else. But of course, if you would want, you could manually send these <code>postMessage</code>s to the player, via plain old vanilla JavaScript, and it would work in the exact same way as using the fancy JS library. So just think of it as an abstraction layer, which you have full control of.</p>

<p>If you want to see what <code>postMessage</code>s a page receives, you could just add an event listener to the page which prints every message to the console:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// listen for all “message” events and log them to the console:</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>message</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>){</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so we can play and pause the player with JavaScript. That’s nothing crazy, but it’s cool. Is there anything else we can do? Yes, there is. Actually, if you read the documentation, there is a bunch of stuff we can do using this Player API. Let’s see some of them that might look interesting to us:</p>

<p><strong>The <code>player.getPlaylist()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you want to embed a playlist into your site, you can use the <code>player.loadPlaylist(playlist_id)</code> method of the library to load a playlist into an existing embedded player. After this, you could call <code>playVideo()</code>, and start playing the first video, after which, the next one from the playlist will automatically start playing, and so on. So we have playlist support.</p>

<p>Now, what if you want to embed a playlist into your site, but want to know what videos are in it? There is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Retrieving_playlist_information">function</a> for that as well. Calling <code>player.getPlaylist()</code>, on a player that has a playlist currently loaded, will return <em>an array of the video IDs in the playlist as they are currently ordered</em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>player</span><span>.</span><span>getPlaylist</span><span>()</span>

<span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>KxgcVAuem8g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>U_OirTVxiFE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rbez_1MEhdQ</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>VpC9qeKUJ00</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good to know..</p>

<p><strong>The not-really deprecated <code>player.getVideoData()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the raw <code>postMessage</code> communication, often you can see an object named <code>videoData</code> being sent by the iframe to the page. This object contains a bunch of stuff about the currently playing video, …</p></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378071300_14862"><div><div><p>An increasingly familiar analysis begins with a vague tale involving rising dissatisfaction with elites, spiralling inequality, and growing political instability. The “twist” is that this describes not a modern Western society, but republican Rome. These comparisons often tend to be shallow, and therefore potentially misleading; is there anything to be learned from them? To answer this question, I turned to the book <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts.</p><p>The key lessons I took from Watt’s narrative could be summarised as follows.</p><p>First, the high degree of social cohesion in early Roman Republic — the critical advantage that helped them defeat their rivals  — was the result of the main source of prestige being not wealth but honours, which were completely controlled by the Republic. Elites competed for such honours by providing services to the state, thereby channelling ambition into pro-social causes. Such a system was probably possible for two reasons. First, the elite was generally small and completely based in the city of Rome. Second, it was composed of wealthy landowners among whom there was little variation in wealth. These two factors taken together probably meant that the only way to rise in status was to obtain the honours granted by state service. </p><p>Second, once Rome began to expand, wealth began to increase due to the spoils of foreign conquest and later the gains from trade. Such wealth began to make the honours bestowed by the state seem somewhat quaint. But aspirant politicians also began to use this wealth to promote themselves, such as by hosting larger gladiator games. Such self-promotion was then leveraged to win offices. This new channel of self-promotion reduced the ability of the state to first require some pro-social efforts in order to obtain an honour. Before, you could only acquire honours by doing the state some service. Later, you could really only acquire honours by first acquiring wealth. </p><p>Once wealth was used to lock-in power, power was used to lock-in wealth. This positive feedback loop eventually incurred a populist backlash, the energies of which were used by successive politicians to undermine the system, to introduce dynastic politics, and eventually to establish an autocracy. </p><p>For a political system to avoid the descent into demagoguery, it needs to prevent a positive feedback loop forming between wealth and power. While the strength of that feedback loop varies across the West, it still seems to pose difficulties in many countries. Eliminating it either requires a reduction of inequality, or else creating a mechanism to prevent people from using wealth to influence the rules and processes regarding the selection of political elites.</p><p>But breaking this loop alone cannot create a cohesive society. For that, a social reward along the lines of the Roman honours system could be useful. In the below essay, I speculate about some ideas for how this idea could be implemented in a modern society. It involves creating a bottom-up selection process in small groups. Safeguards against nepotism or dominance by the wealthy could be overseen by a group that has no monetary wealth and/or children, as such a group would not have the ability and/or incentive to favour their children.</p><p>To understand how I came to take these lessons from the book, read on.</p></div><h3>Introduction</h3><div><p>The ghost of the Roman Empire looms over any discussion on the fate of societies. In the last decade, the course of events has causes the number of comparisons to rise. Trump tried but failed to be a Caesar-like figure in wielding populist sentiment like a weapon against democratic norms. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, compared the 2015 European migration crisis to the <em>Völkerwanderung</em> that heralded the end of the Western Roman Empire. </p><p>But does the story of the very different Roman society actually have lessons for our own? To answer this question, I turned to <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts, Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego. It outlines in detail the events that led to Rome transitioning from essentially a highly cohesive aristocracy to the oligarchic autocracy founded by Augustus. The story starts not when Rome was at its most extensive, but when it was most cohesive — for it was this cohesion that enabled the rapid expansion that would come later. </p></div><h3>A Demonstration of Roman Social Cohesion</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378124246_16527"><div>

He won his first encounter with the Romans but at a cost of between one-sixth and one-half of his most highly trained soldiers. Despite being victorious, he could not continue to sustain such losses. Even worse for Pyrrhus, he couldn’t win the allegiance of any significant Roman allies in the south of Italy, and the Romans had no difficulty in replacing any killed or injured soldiers. He therefore needed to negotiate with the Romans. </p><p>His strategy for this negotiation included lenient terms and expensive presents. The Romans were initially close to accepting this offer but ultimately rejected it as the humiliation of defeat could have put Roman hegemony over Italy at risk, resulting in more threats in the future. </p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378124246_25603"><div>

Noting that the Roman interlocutor, Fabricius, was relatively poor, Pyrrhus decided to offer Fabricius “so much silver and gold that he would be able to surpass all the Romans who are said to be most wealthy.” Fabricius refused the offer and Watts recounts his reply as follows:</p><blockquote><p><em>Fabricius, we are told, responded to Pyrrhus by informing him that his assumption was incorrect. Though he did not possess great material wealth, Fabricius told Pyrrhus, he did hold the highest offices in the state, he was sent on the most distinguished embassies, he was called upon to publicly express his opinions on the most important issues, and he was praised, envied, and honored for his uprightness. The Roman Republic, he continued, provided everyone who goes into public service with honors more splendid than any possession. It also regularly made an account of the property of Romans and could easily find anyone who had become wealthy dishonorably. What good would it do, Fabricius supposedly concluded, for him to accept gold and silver when this would cost him his honor and reputation? How could he endure a life in which he and his descendants were wealthy but disgraced?</em></p></blockquote><div><p>Pyrrhus did not win and eventually left Italy for good. But the above example illustrates an interesting point. Fabricius valued honour over possessions and wealth. And more importantly, wealth could not be used to purchase honour.</p><p>Because honour could only be attained by public service, the energies of the most ambitious Romans were channelled towards the common good. According to Watt, “Romans of the third century instead judged each man’s merit by the offices he held, the honors he earned, and whether his achievements equaled those of his ancestors.” This meant that the “Republic dictated what sort of service an individual gave, it determined what sorts of rewards he would receive, and it paid these rewards out in a form of social currency that it alone controlled.”</p><p>The system of honour included a series of offices known as the <em>cursus honorum</em>, where at a given age one was eligible to be elected to a certain post only if one had completed a previous position. The first step involved serving 10 years in the military. After this position and on becoming 30 years of age, one was eligible to run for the position of quaestor (thereby becoming deputy to a provincial governor or a financial administrator). This would last for one year. After this and on reaching 36, one could have served as an aedile. After being an aedile or a quaestor, and being at least 39 years old, one could have run to be a praetor.</p><p>Quaestors, aediles, and tribunes were all elected by the popular assembly and the <em>concilium plebis</em>. After being a praetor and attaining the age of 42 years old, one could have run for the consul position which was perceived as the peak of a career. Again, this position lasted for one year. Consuls and praetors were both elected by the <em>comitia centuriata</em>, which in practice was dominated by the wealthy.</p><p>This system lay within a constitution that seemed to balance the influence of the plebeians and the patricians. Interestingly, it was one where the Senate, made up of former high office holders, only had advisory power in theory but in reality exercised a great deal of informal influence and deference such that little happened without their approval. In a similar discordant fashion, the <em>concilium plebis</em> where the plebeians were represented had a great deal of power in theory — after 287 BC it could unilaterally make laws which bound all Romans — but it rarely exercised this prerogative, partly due to influence from wealthy plebeians. </p><p>This divergence between theory and practise would prove to be a vulnerability later …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here’s a thing I don’t see appreciated enough about Rust: <code>loop</code>.
I know I don’t think about it all that much,
but pretty much every time I use it I feel a bit of satisfaction.</p>

<p><code>loop</code> is just an unconditional loop:
it loops forever, or until you write <code>break</code>, or <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>Most languages don’t have it.</p>

<p>Instead, loop constructs usually have some kind of termination condition,
your <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.
Apparently <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sather">Sather</a></em> has an unconditional <code>loop</code> keyword like Rust.
I only know this because a programming language historian mentioned it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906#issuecomment-4240501">on the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Why do I love <code>loop</code>?</p>

<p>Because it frees me from thinking about how to end a loop
before I’ve even started writing it.</p>

<p>Many problems are easy to recognize as ones that require a looping solution:
I quickly realize, “I have to do something multiple times”.</p>

<p>Sometimes that loop just involves iterating over a container of things,
one at a time.
That’s easy to recognize as a <code>for thing in things { }</code> situation.
Other loops have more complex conditions though.
Often when I’m solving a looping problem,
I will know one or some of the steps I intend to do in a loop,
but will not envision the complete solution ahead of time.</p>

<p>So I just write</p>



<p>and start coding what I do know needs to happen,
and work from there.</p>

<p>For some reason this feels great.</p>

<p>Once I have solved my looping problem,
there will be a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> somewhere in there,
or multiple <code>break</code>s and/or <code>return</code>s.
Maybe it makes sense to convert it into a <code>while</code> loop,
maybe not. But there’s not a great need
for <code>while</code> when you’ve got <code>loop</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>return</code>.
Do readers really need to know the loop termination condition
before reading what happens in the loop?
Or, in languages with <code>do { } while (…)</code> loops,
after the very end of the loop?
I don’t know,
but writing the termination condition
naturally wherever it “wants” to live in the loop
seems reasonable to me.
One does though need to be considerate of
their readers by keeping the loop body a readable length.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, a small project I’m working on right now
contains 2 instances of <code>loop</code>, 2 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/while_let.html"><code>while let</code></a>,
and 8 of <code>for … in</code>;
no standard <code>while</code> loops.
And I think the <code>loop</code> loops read better than if I had
tried to convert them to <code>while</code> loops.</p>

<p>Here’s one example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>async_channel</span><span>::</span><span>unbounded</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>FsThreadContext</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>rx</span><span>.recv</span><span>())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"recv"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>msg</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Shutdown</span><span>(</span><span>rsp_tx</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>context</span><span>.shutdown</span><span>();</span>
                <span>rsp_tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"send"</span><span>);</span>
                <span>break</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the other:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>header</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>line</span><span>.truncate</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>line</span><span>.is_empty</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"broken frame header"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>line</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>==</span> <span>FRAME_BODY_MARKER</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>header</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s common in C-like languages to write an unconditional loop
with <code>while (true) { }</code>.</p>

<p>I’m steeped enough in Rust that I don’t know if writing <code>while (true) { }</code>
brings others the same satisfaction as I get from <code>loop { }</code>,
but I suspect not: it looks and feels just like a tiny bit of a hack.
And if I go into writing a loop by first writing <code>while …</code>
then I am immediately presented with the question,
“while <em>what</em>?”,
and sometimes I just don’t want to think about that yet.</p>

<p>Besides <em>feeling</em> good,
there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">a technical reason that Rust has <code>loop</code></a>:
it helps analyze control flow.
With it, the compiler can trivially know that any code
after the loop is unreachable.
In Rust at least this is important for type checking.
This kind of analysis <em>is done</em> in other languages,
but by my recollection they sometimes actually
special case <code>while (true) { }</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the differences in how Rust
treats <code>loop</code> vs. <code>while true</code> <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=010dce12fdd4c0818322717e161a2f91">on the playground</a>.
Run it and check out the warning the compiler
issues; try to alter the example as suggested in the comments.</p>

<p>Bonus Rust trivia:
did you know that <code>loop</code> is an expression,
with the same type as its <code>break</code> statements,
and the result of <code>loop</code> can be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#break-and-loop-values">assigned to a value</a>?</p>

<p>I did not!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">issue on the bug tracker</a> appears
to be the only remains of the design discussion around <code>loop</code> in Rust,
though it is insightful to the designers’ original thinking.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2012-03-06.md">meeting minutes</a> where it was approved
just say there was consensus to add it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Unconditional loops are unconditionally awesome"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># XOR of all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># XOR of all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

<p>Recently I've been reading about the theory of 1,000 True Fans.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a> founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_(editor)">Kevin Kelly</a> came up with it 12 years ago.</p><p>In an essay titled <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans</a>, Kevin says that if you want to have a successful business, all you need are 1,000 True Fans, each paying you around $100 a year.</p><p>1,000 x $100 = a yearly salary of $100,000.</p><p>Not bad at all!</p><p>Now, I think there's a lot of truth to Kevin's theory. But when it comes to numbers, he's a little off.</p><p>Based on my experience, to have a truly sustainable business, you need 2,450,000,000 True Fans.</p><p>That's it!</p><p>That's the magic number.</p><p>Once you hit 2,450,000,000 True Fans, you can rest easy.</p><p>But they have to be True Fans. They have to <em>really love</em> what you're doing.</p><p>For instance, nearly all of my 2,450,000,000 True Fans spend hours on my site â€“ every single day!</p><p>Eat your heart out, Kevin.</p><p>Even if each fan only paid me one cent a year, I'd still easily be making enough to get by.</p><p>But in my case, each of them make me a full $23!</p><p>That means that by having just 2.45 billion True Fans, I make $56 billion dollars a year.</p><p>Maybe that doesn't sound so great to you. But for me, it's been a <em>game-changer</em>.</p><p>Every time I log into my Stripe account and see $4.7 billion coming in every month, I feel a huge wave of relief. I know that I'll be able to handle the mortgage and finally pay off my student loan.</p><p>And, of course, I feel a wave of gratitude â€“ not just to my close-knit community of 2.45 billion True Fans, but also to the 500 million early adopters of my product. I couldn't have done it without those trailblazers.</p><hr><p>So if there's just one growth hack I'd recommend to indie hackers or creatives starting out along the long, hard road to financial independence, it would be this:</p><p><em>Try get at least two billion people to really love what you're doing.</em></p><p>A lot of people may try to tell you that having just 100, or even 1,000 True Fans will get you to where you need to be.</p><p>They're wrong.</p><p>You'll only be able to be <em>truly </em>comfortable once you get to 2,450,000,000.</p><p>That might seem like a big number now. But just wait until you have 31.4% of the world's population using your product on a regular basis.</p><p>Once you get there, I'm betting you'll remember that time, not long ago, when you read these words of advice and thought 'Hey...this growth hack is crazy, but <em>it might just work!</em>'</p><hr><p>Thanks to Louis Barclay (<a href="https://twitter.com/louisbarclay">@louisbarclay</a>) for allowing me the opportunity to write this guest post on the <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a> blog.</p>

        <p><em>Stale Bot’s</em> are a type of automated bot on Github, which locks issues which are “stale” (as in have no recent activity). This seems like a helpful tool at first, but in reality it’s terrible for all parties involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular has a popular repository</a> on github which receives hundreds of issues every day. They use the stale bot to lock old issues, which have no activity in order to reduce the amount of issues in the repository. On the surface the Stale Bot is doing great work, reducing the number of active issues in the repo, but in reality it’s a bit insane.</p>
<h2 id="Maintainer’s-perspective"><a href="#Maintainer’s-perspective" title="Maintainer’s perspective"></a>Maintainer’s perspective</h2><p>Issues are being automatically locked, new users can’t add to issue so they create a duplicate issue, or even worse, just don’t report that the issue still exists!</p>
<h2 id="User’s-perspective"><a href="#User’s-perspective" title="User’s perspective"></a>User’s perspective</h2><p>A user of Angular will <em>Google</em> the error text and will usually find the corresponding github issue. But more often than not, the issue is locked, by the heroic <em>lock bot</em>. So they have a few options, continue searching for another more recent (less SEO’d issue) OR either create another issue, effectively duplicating the bug.</p>
<p>If they decide to create a duplicate issue, it will often not be linked it to the original issue… Now there are 2 issues duplicating the same bug in the Angular repo, so what did “Stale Bot” achieve?</p>
<p>Well the stale bot has had the following effects on the repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the metric of <em>Open Issues</em> in github</li>
<li>Made duplicate issues far more likely</li>
<li>Increased friction of users reporting that the issue still exists</li>
<li>Ultimately decreased the quality of the software, as the issues don’t accurately reflect reality</li>
</ol>
<p>For a moment, imagine that Stack Overflow did this. If there’s no interaction on a question, then the question should be locked… Well questions that don’t get consistent interaction are inevitably duplicated, or not updated with correct information, or people get frustrated and don’t ask the question again.</p>
<p>The best repo’s in my opinion, don’t prevent users from contributing to older issues. This gives a much better user experience, as friction to contribute to issues is much lower. It also lets the maintainers ensure that old issues aren’t needlessly duplicated. Finally, the community feels like the maintainers actually care about their input, which doesn’t feel that way when an automated <em>stale bot</em> locks and closes your inactive issue without any input from a human…</p>

sol &lt;- de$solve(fastprob,de$Tsit5(),saveat=0.01)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Under the hood it's using the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/">DifferentialEquations.jl package</a> and the <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML stack</a>, but it's abstracted from users so much that Julia is essentially an alternative to Rcpp with easier interactive development. The following example really brings the seamless integration home:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>install.packages(diffeqr)
library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
degpu &lt;- diffeqr::diffeqgpu_setup()
&nbsp;
lorenz &lt;- function (u,p,t){
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  c(du1,du2,du3)
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(lorenz,u0,tspan,p)
fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
&nbsp;
prob_func &lt;- function (prob,i,rep){
  de$remake(prob,u0=runif(3)*u0,p=runif(3)*p)
}
ensembleprob = de$EnsembleProblem(fastprob, prob_func = prob_func, safetycopy=FALSE)
sol &lt;- de$solve(ensembleprob,de$Tsit5(),degpu$EnsembleGPUArray(),trajectories=10000,saveat=0.01)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This example does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatically installs Julia</li>
<li>Automatically installs DifferentialEquations.jl</li>
<li>Automatically installs CUDA (via CUDA.jl)</li>
<li>Automatically installs ModelingToolkit.jl and DiffEqGPU.jl</li>
<li>JIT transpiles the R function to Julia via ModelingToolkit</li>
<li>Uses KernelAbstractions (in DiffEqGPU) to generate a CUDA kernel from the Julia code</li>
<li>Solves the ODE 10,000 times with different parameters 350x over deSolve</li>
</ol>
<p>What a complicated code! Well maybe it would shock you to know that the source code for the diffeqr package <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr/blob/v1.1/R/diffeqr.R">is only 150 lines of code</a>. Of course, it's powered by a lot of Julia magic in the backend, and so can your next package.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Social media sucks. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are designed to turn your precious free time into money. What we see as a nice way to stay in touch with our friends, in reality are just many hits of dopamine stimulating precise spots in your brain, leading to you spending more time on the platform consuming ads.</p><p>But what if I told you that there is a huge ad-free social network out there, not governed by a central authority, full of great people and completely free to use? This place is called the fediverse. Well, it's not really <strong>a</strong> place, it's many places.</p><h2>What is the fediverse?</h2><p>At its core, the fediverse is a mesh of interconnected nodes on the internet, all communicating in the same language. Every instance on the fediverse implements the <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, which allows it to talk to other instances on the network. The phrase "Fedi" comes from "federated", meaning that content on the network is shared and accessible by anyone.</p><p>There are many different software projects for the fediverse out there. If you like the concept of Twitter, you could take a look at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a microblogging-platform for the fediverse. There's also <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>, a federated clone of YouTube (PeerTube recently <a href="https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/">released support for peer2peer live streaming support</a>, like what?! 🤯). You like instagram? <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> got you covered. Of course, there are many other services worth mentioning, so feel free to dig around a bit! As mentioned, the great thing about the fediverse is that all of these services are connected with each other. If I signed up for an account on a mastodon instance, I can subscribe to your posts on Pixelfed, and vice versa. If I want to get notified about your videos on PeerTube, I can just go ahead and follow your account and comment on your videos.</p><blockquote><p>"This all sounds great, but why should I bother?"</p></blockquote><p>Let me give you 6 reasons why the fediverse is far superior to all other social media platforms out there, and why you should consider signing up for an account on one of the many instances of the fediverse.</p><h2>Reason 1: It's decentralized</h2><p>Regular social media platforms like Facebook have a <strong>single point of failure</strong>. If their servers go down, your content goes down with it. Content on the fediverse on the other hand is scattered around many instances, which means it is very resilient. If your instance dies, you can move to a new instance. This goes hand in hand with the next reason.</p><h2>Reason 2: It can't be censored</h2><p>You probably heard that the Twitter-account of Donald Trump recently got compromised by the owners of the platform. I don't want to engage in any political discussions, but the main flaw with this is the violation of <strong>freedom of speech</strong>. Even if everything someone says is controversial nonsense, it is still in his good right to express his thoughts.</p><p>On the fediverse, a scenario like this would certainly not happen, given its decentralized nature. Some instances still moderate their content, meaning that if someone posts inappropriate content, it might get blocked. The twist here is, if that person disagrees with the rules of the instance, he is free to join another instance.</p><h2>Reason 3: Free as in freedom</h2><p>There's this saying, criticizing modern software projects:</p><blockquote><p>"If it's free, you're the product"</p></blockquote><p>This is not true in all cases. "Free" can be understood in two ways.</p><p><strong>"Free as in beer"</strong> means that something might seem free at first glance (E.g. Free beer at Oktoberfest), but in the end you often leave with less than you came with. In the case of beer, you often buy another beer after the first free one. Therefore, even though you think you've saved the money for one beer, in reality bought an extra beer. In the case of proprietary software, it's a similar story. While you think that a service is free, you give up your privacy and get monetized with ads.</p><p><strong>"Free as in freedom"</strong> on the other hand means that you won't get "screwed over" like this. Most, if not all of the software for the fediverse is <strong>free and open source software</strong> (FOSS). If you don't like how a certain feature works, <strong>you are completely free to change it</strong>. You can look at the source code and propose changes to the main project, or launch your own spin of that product.</p><p>Since everyone can openly look at the source code, it is <strong>audited</strong> by many people, including security experts. This vastly improves the security and stability of the product. If the developers would do shady things, they will most certainly get called out by people, as soon as that code enters the main repositories. Proprietary (closed sourced) platforms like Facebook and Twitter can not be audited. The owners can do whatever they want, including spying on their users, or collect and sell the data of their users.</p><h2>Reason 4: It respects your privacy</h2><p>Since the software on the fediverse is audited by a lot of people, you can be almost 100% certain that joining an instance will not collect any of your personal data. If you are still concerned about your privacy though, you can still be part of the network by launching your own instance, with your own rules. There are tutorials out there, explaining how you can set up a small instance for a very cheap price on your local network.</p><h2>Reason 5: It's all about the community</h2><p>I used to spend a lot of time on "regular" social media platforms. From personal experiences, these platforms are all about promoting yourself and building up your follower count. Connecting with your friends is of little importance. In the eye of some people, you are not worthy to talk to if the amount of followers or likes-per-post didn't exceed a certain threshold.</p><p>It has now been about 5 months since I created <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">my mastodon account</a>. Talking to people on the fediverse is a completely different experience compared to Facebook or Twitter. Almost everyone I talked to is a polite, grounded person, willing to engage in constructive and fun discussions. I met many people who disagree with my views, but instead of leaving a comment saying that this post sucks, all of them took the time to express their alternative opinions. Every member of the fediverse wants to drive the network forward, which is reflected in their posts.</p><h2>Reason 6: There's an instance for everyone</h2><p>Whether you're into Gaming, Painting, or Spanish dancing music, there is an instance for you. If it isn't, you are free to create one and promote it to people of that niche. You won't loose the social aspect by launching your own instance, since you are still available to other people on the network. If you just want to get started with the fediverse, I recommend that you check out one of the many <a href="https://instances.social/">lists of mastodon instances</a>. If you like instagram and want to stay in a familiar environment, take a look at <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>, and join an instance from the list they provide.</p><p>I myself am a person who cares a lot about free and open source software, therefore my choice of instance was <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, a mastodon instance geared towards awesome like-minded people.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post has generated some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25820646">Hacker News</a>.</p><p>This is post 005 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, consider<!-- --> <a href="https://donate.slashdev.space/">buying me a coffee</a>!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he beachfront narrows to an ocherous ribbon, belted by blue, above and below. After a while, a handful of shearwaters appear in the air above the <em>Cat Balou</em>. The birds flash around us; like knife-thrower tricks at a circus. Diving through the water, each is crowned in a diadem of bubbles. The shearwaters come from Antarctica, like the humpbacks, and also Siberia, South America, and Japan; they arrive in Australia, where they often die in large numbers from exhaustion. Such bird deaths, en masse, are known as â€œwreck events.â€� A single wreck event used to happen every ten years or so—the result of irregular, rough weather overtaxing the birdsâ€™ reserves—but flock-wide collapses occur almost biennially now, the feathered bodies washing up on the tideline, emaciated with hunger. Their prey are vanishing from the migration route as oceans warm. These shearwaters fly away, to where? I wish I could write <em>These birds leave in the direction of exquisite fortune, to live long, robust lives</em>.</p>

<p>From the cutwater, and either side of the boat, the watchers squint in all directions, and still there are no whales. A few people have given up, withdrawing to the lower deck for a rallying snack. I nurse a cup of instant soup, freckled with rehydrated corn and carrot, warming my hands. The light changes, the ocean turns waxy. Little slaps, notches and gloss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œThe whale who will come soon,â€� a boy begins, in the rising pitch of hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œThe whale <em>that </em>will come soon,â€� a man—I suspect, his father—corrects, not unkindly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we wait and the tour meanders on, I ponder whether the pronoun choice isnâ€™t, in fact, more than a semantic niggle. Designating a whale as â€œthatâ€� is distancing and turns the animal, grammatically, into an object. â€œWhoâ€� is personifying and brings the whale into a closer nexus with the speaker by implying it possesses human qualities. Australian newspapers, I think, use â€œthatâ€� for animals. (On returning to shore, I will go to <em>The Associated Press Stylebook </em>to clarify: the stylebook stipulates â€œwhoâ€� is appropriate only where an animal has been given a personal name, and it offers this example: â€œThe dog, <em>which </em>was lost, howled,â€� . . . â€œAdelaide, <em>who </em>was lost, howled.â€�) No doubt other languages have more middle-ground pronouns for animals—something between â€œthingâ€� and â€œkin.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go back up on deck to find the swell has lifted, shortening the depth of our perspective: the <em>Cat Balou </em>is dropped and raised. Water hammocks heap into hummocks, then fall back again. Clouds overhead loose bright patches to blow across the expanse, as if someone had unleashed a stash of foil Mylar blankets, the kind used for hypothermia. The effect is cyclically sedating and awakening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You believe you could step off the boat and walk for days. Things go on like this for a long while. Then Ros gets on the loudspeaker. â€œ<em>Whaleeey</em>,â€� she calls out, across&nbsp; the sun-blown sea. â€œ<em>Whaleeey whale! Here, whaleeey whale! </em>â€�</p>
<blockquote>We come to whales to be drawn out into the world, and yet the unpeopled sea is also a state of mind—an inner space.</blockquote>
<p><span>W</span>e come to whales to be drawn out into the world, and yet the unpeopled sea is also a state of mind—an inner space. Our smallness, set against this sublime sea, is connected to the notion that not all the thoughts within us are accessible, that there are thoughts, in some sense, <em>exterior to the self</em>. Vast feelings that slide, beyond command, beneath the wakeful tending of our days. The pleasure is that we are mysterious, even to ourselves. The fabulist ocean, this inscrutable outer space whales return from, in a metaphorical sense, enchants us with our own inward enigmas. Many throughout history have figured the sea analogous to the human unconscious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud most notably made popular the expression â€œoceanic feelingâ€� to account for convictions of limitlessness and eternality that might lead to an inclination for religious observance. Freud connected this belief to the irrecoverable sensations of being a baby—before an infant is aware of its separateness, when the contours of the self are blurred. A bygone time when, Freud claimed, each of us felt at one, with every surrounding object and phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itâ€™s often forgotten that Freud began his professional life as an aspiring naturalist with a passion for aquatic environments. Freudâ€™s college drawings are of the nerves in crayfish and lamprey. He studied under the Darwinist Karl Claus, and undertook fieldwork at a zoological research station in Trieste, on the Adriatic Sea, attempting to identify testicles in eels. Later, the concept of oceanic feeling came to Freud through correspondence with the dramatist Romain Rolland, a mystic who described himself as a member of an â€œantique species,â€� and whose work with eastern religions in the early twentieth century sought to explain the appeal of pious temperaments. After Freud, the ocean came to denote unbounded inner space, whether that sense of limitlessness formed around a spiritual consciousness or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What ocean is this, that I have begun to call a <em>mare incognitum</em>? <em>Mare incognitum</em>—undisclosed sea. An imaginary place. Also, a mentality cast upon the globe. The purpose of this creation? The <em>mare incognitum </em>stands in for the unconscious, the unexamined interior. DÃ©jÃ&nbsp; vu, inner visions. Misreadings, mishearings, the ineffable. What fruits in dreams. Slips of the tongue and free associations. A place where subcurrents of pain are metabolized, and from which erotic desire and creativity supposedly spring. Intuitions: alien, animal, sordid, and stray. All of this has a sealike texture. Doesnâ€™t it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that the unconscious can be envisaged as a sea has its own history. It owes its existence to narratives about what the ocean represents in the Western tradition and the twentieth century, narratives addressing how human mentality functions, and whether an individualâ€™s sense of self, separate from her or his community, is even interesting to plumb (or decorous to expose). It is a trope composed in art, worship, literature. How does a space as boundless and ungraspable as â€œthe seaâ€� come to seem personal and intimate? It took a long time before I came to realize that the processes by which the sea was turned into a metaphor for a personâ€™s unconscious were neither natural nor private. I belong to these narratives—maybe you do too. I pick up whatever thing a dream washes onto my shoreline and turn it over to look, hoping for the shimmery incandescence of pearl shell and fearing, instead, the exposure of a writhing, unspeakable underside—an impulse unmentionable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I am left with is: What will it mean for our inner lives—those of us who cannot disavow the ocean as a psychological motif—if the twenty-first-century sea turns out to be not full of mystery, not inexplicable in its depths, but peppered with the uncannily familiar detritus of human life? How will we delight in a feeling of unboundedness, in the apparent limitlessness, the unknowable space of our unconscious, if the real ocean demolishes its symbolic history?&nbsp;</p>
<p>An emotional landscape, it turns out, can also begin to acidify. Something hard to quantify, I suspect, disappears from the palette of human experience, from how we articulate our selfhood to one another, and from our relationship to our own private, inner depths, when we encounter evidence of the oceanâ€™s despoliation. Much fascinating scientific work is being done on how animals are learning to navigate the changing worldâ€™s new behavioral demands, but less is dedicated to how human cultures are adapting; how our language and imagination is corroded, and in what deficit of narrative and nature we seek for fresh expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without notice, weâ€™re off. The engine strains, and the prow of the boat tilts back, hit by slab after slab of spray. It becomes necessary to unlock your knees to take the impact and bounce of each wave, as when surfing—and itâ€™s excellent fun. No one can juggle a camera or binoculars now: weâ€™re all gripping to any available railing with both hands. A woman near me pukes a spectacular mustardy arc over the side. The womanâ€™s daughter looks on alarmed, from within the clutched tent of the waterproof jacket she has borrowed from her mother. She canâ€™t detach herself from clinging to a fire extinguisher, buckled to the exterior of the cabin (the only anchor point sheâ€™s been able to locate). I give her a grin, and my lip catches on a dry eyetooth, studding in the cold. All knuckles whiten. Seawater griddles the windows, glistens the boat. Whole-head smiles sweep through the group, like the beams from beacons atop dozens of crazed lighthouses. â€œWhoop!â€� yells a man in a Sea Shepherd sweater, his hair whipped up on end. â€œ<em>Whooop</em>,â€� retort people on the portside, louder. There are whales, there are whales! If this is being announced on the speaker, Rosâ€™s voice is lost to the drag of air.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Humpbacks? Yes, humpbacks. Now visible, white like little teeth. Are the whales leaping? Leaping! How many? Three? Four whales? We are gaining on them! Three. They are white, and also black, chrome blue, and mineral gray. Will the skipper slow the boat? At that very thought, the engine modes down and the reek of exhaust pulls over us, thick as a quilt. The fumes dissipate, and the whale-watching tour motors forward at a more moderate speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are putting on their sunglasses and taking off sweaters and lens caps. Weâ€™re jostling around the bow to watch the whales in the distance, salt air high in our nostrils. Homunculus whales at this interval, erupting from a patch of ocean without pattern. Gradually the boat homes in on them, and we can see the humpbacks sending up great crescents of salt water, slamming their bulk, over and over, against the seaâ€™s surface. I want to describe it as beautiful, …</p></article></div>

<article>
  <p>Go has plenty of useful builtin functionality for safe, concurrent and parallel code. However neat those features may be, they cannot write your program for you. As is the case for many languagges, the most important morsels of knowledge are not in the features of the language, but in the well-known <em>patterns</em> that compose those features into solutions that can address frequently reoccurring problems. I’m relatively new to using Go as my daily bread-and-butter language and recently encountered a useful pattern that I thought worth sharing. I’m told that at Palantir it is called the <em>tickler</em> pattern.</p>

<h2 id="the-tickler-pattern">The Tickler Pattern</h2>

<p>The tickler pattern addresses a very particular scenario:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have a service processing requests of some kind and looping forever,</li>
  <li>Calling the service should not block the caller,</li>
  <li>You optionally want to bound the amount of parallelism in the service, i.e. how many requests are processed at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crux of the pattern will look as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>list.List</code> will represent the service’s internal queue,</li>
  <li>We’ll have the service loop forever, waiting for a signal to reconsider the contents of the queue,</li>
  <li>When a new request is enqueued, this signal is sent,</li>
  <li>When the service completes the work for a request, this signal is also sent,</li>
  <li>A semaphore puts a limit on the number of in-flight requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at the code and discuss these steps in more detail. We begin with our types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Dummy request -- usually some Protobuf/Thrift struct</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Request</span> <span>int</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Service</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>mu</span>         <span>sync</span><span>.</span><span>Mutex</span>
    <span>queue</span>      <span>*</span><span>list</span><span>.</span><span>List</span>
    <span>sema</span>       <span>chan</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>loopSignal</span> <span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll use a channel to represent a bounded semaphore. This is perfectly idiomatic in Go, although you could also use <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/semaphore"><code>sync.Semaphore</code></a> for this if you really wanted to. One of our explicit requirements for the kind of solution we wanted was that the caller shall never block when making a request. This requirement is met by the fact that we will always first enqueue a request, leaving its processing to be done asynchronously. Note that my solution will not provide a way to retrieve a response for the request.</p>

<p>We acquire a mutex for our queue since we will have multiple goroutines accessing it concurrently. We enqueue the request and then notify the loop. The last part is explained in a bit. Now that we have a way of adding requests, we can work on the code to handle the requests. Since this is a service, we’ll have it loop forever waiting for new work to be done. This is also where the loop signal comes into play:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>loop</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Starting service loop"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>loopSignal</span><span>:</span>
            <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>tryDequeue</span><span>()</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>Done</span><span>()</span><span>:</span>
            <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Loop context cancelled"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our <code>loop</code> method will have the service loop until the <code>Done()</code> channel on a context that we pass in is fulfilled. This will allow us to shut down the service gracefully at the end of our program, or in case an error occurs. More importantly, we wait for the <code>loopSignal</code> to tell us to <em>reconsider the queue</em>. This signal is sent on one of two occasions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When a new request is enqueued,</li>
  <li>When we finish processing a request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can convince yourself that these are the only two events in the lifetime of our service at which it is necessary to consider the queue. If the service’s queue is empty, enqueuing a new request tells the service to look at this new request. If a request is enqueued but it cannot be handled right away because we’ve reached the limit on the parallelism we configured, the only time this will change is when a request completes processing, i.e. when the semaphore is replenished by one token.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at <code>tryDequeue</code>, which is called whenever the loop is “tickled”. Its unconfident naming stems from the fact that when <code>tryDequeue</code> is called, we:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don’t know whether the queue has any requests at all, since the signal could have originated from having finished processing the last in-flight request,</li>
  <li>Don’t know whether we have sufficient resources if there is a request in the queue.</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>tryDequeue</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>dequeue</span><span>()</span> <span>Request</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>element</span> <span>:=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Front</span><span>()</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Remove</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>element</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We check for the first case of uncertainty by testing the length of the queue. If we know we have work to do, we need to check if the semaphore has sufficient slots to allow for the request to be handled. Because our semaphore <code>sema</code> will be a buffered channel, we know that if the semaphore has no slots left, sending it a new token (the integer <code>1</code>) will block, or in this case trigger the default case. If we’ve reached our limit on parallelism, we simply punt on handling this request until the loop is tickled anew. The <code>dequeue</code> function is a little helper that takes care of the nasty business of popping an element from the queue, which is made to involve type casting because of Go’s lack of generics.</p>

<p>If a request passes the demanding tests of the <code>tryDequeue</code> function and is elected for processing, we take care of it in the <code>process</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span><span>request</span> <span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>replenish</span><span>()</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Processing request %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// Simulate work</span>
    <span>&lt;-</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>After</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>500</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>replenish</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;-</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Replenishing semaphore, now %d/%d slots in use</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span><span>),</span> <span>cap</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span><span>))</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>tickleLoop</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s really more interesting is the <code>replenish</code> function. This function has two responsibilities. First, it frees a slot in the semaphore so that a new request may be handled. Second, it tickles the loop to inform it that it’s a good time to consider the request queue again, in case there are requests that were blocked on other requests completing first. If you recall, this is the second of two cases in which the request queue must be reconsidered.</p>

<p>Let’s also lift the veil of mystery on the <code>tickleLoop</code> function. It simply makes a non-blocking send to the <code>loopSignal</code> channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>tickleLoop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>loopSignal</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}{}</span><span>:</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we tie everything together in the constructor of our service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>NewService</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>requestLimit</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>service</span> <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Service</span><span>{</span>
        <span>queue</span><span>:</span>      <span>list</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>sema</span><span>:</span>       <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>requestLimit</span><span>),</span>
        <span>loopSignal</span><span>:</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{},</span> <span>1</span><span>),</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>go</span> <span>service</span><span>.</span><span>loop</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>service</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We construct <code>loopSignal</code> as a buffered channel with one free slot. If the service’s loop is currently waiting for a value from the channel, a single send will tell it to reconsider the queue. If it is currently considering the queue but a request completes processing, we need to “enqueue” a signal so that when it exits <code>tryDequeue</code> and re-enters the context of the <code>select</code> statement, it knows to immediately reconsider the queue. The <code>sema</code> semaphore is a channel with sufficient buffering for the number of concurrent processing slots we wish to allow for the service. My <code>NewService</code> constructor starts the loop right away, but you could also make <code>Loop</code> a public method and do this outside of the constructor.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>A brief demonstration of our service in action is due:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>cancel</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithCancel</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Background</span><span>())</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>cancel</span><span>()</span>
    <span>service</span> <span>:=</span> <span>NewService</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>service</span><span>.</span><span>EnqueueRequest</span><span>(</span><span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>));</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"error sending request: %v"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
            <span>break</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>&lt;-</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>After</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Second</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We create a cancellable context for the service that we use to signal the service to terminate its loop. For this demonstration, I bound the parallelism to three requests. The infinite loop at the end simulates running the service forever. Running this code produces the following output (out of many possible variations):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>2020/12/06 12:09:43 Added request to queue with length 1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>I am teaching Haskell in the 1st semester CS master programme course <a href="https://www.lambdabytes.io/lecturenotes/concepts/index.html">Concepts of higher programming languages</a> at the <a href="https://www.fhv.at/en">University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg</a>. Why did I decide for Haskell and not Python, JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), Scala, Erlang, Rust, <em>Your Favourite Programming Language</em>?</p>
<p>At this point I assume and expect that students are not only familiar with mainstream object-oriented programming (Java, C#) but that they more or less excel in it - they don’t have to be experts (nor can they, unless they have worked for many years in the industry), but they should be very confident and be able to write larger, complex applications in a proper OO way.</p>
<p>Getting into another OOish language like Python, JS, TS would be simply a waste of time. Therefore, I was contemplating teaching the central concepts of Haskell, Erlang and Rust. For Rust that would be its <em>borrowing</em> feature and how it achieves safe memory management, for Erlang that would be <em>Actors and shared-nothing-semantics message-passing</em>; and for Haskell… well it would be <em>Monads</em> but for the students to fully get it I realised that I would need to give a proper introduction into the whole language (following along the lines of Graham Huttons brilliant Book <em>Programming in Haskell (2nd ed.)</em> and extending it).</p>
<p>So I decided to go for “Haskell only” and it turned out to be the right decision, especially for a course on <em><strong>Concepts</strong></em> <em>of higher programming languages</em>. Haskell allows to discuss many concepts in the context of a pure functional language which makes it especially suitable for such a course. Of course, some concepts the students “know” from OO as they have found their way into mainstream by now but the way these concepts are presented and need to be dealt with in Haskell is in such a pure way that students will learn and get the most out of it. Sure, I could have also decided to teach the concepts in JS but they would come across as muddled and not very clear - and some of these concepts would simply not have been possible in JS (or would have been a crude and ugly workaround, with the deeper idea completely hidden underneath).</p>
<p>I am very well aware that very few (none) of the students will pick up Haskell later in their day-to-day life as software engineers, however it is my firm belief that the way this course taught them these concepts, will have made them much better developers, because they have a broader and deeper understanding of them. The main concepts I chose to teach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Static Types, immutable data, basic functions</strong>. Dealing with a really strong static type system (yes I know Java is also statically typed but as long as you have dynamic dispatch there is some runtime-type information around…), immutable data and pure functions is a challenge on its own, forcing the students to think very different about what they know so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit Recursion</strong>. No more mutable data, therefore we employ recursion instead of iteration and in-place memory updates. To think recursively takes a while but is probably among the most important abilities for computer scientists and it can never hurt to reiterate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong>. Probably the most essential concept to learn in this pure form in Haskell. The way it works in Haskell in combination with Currying and Lambdas is tremendously powerful, which is also realised by students. This concept has entered mainstream OO languages by now, therefore students are able to pick it up quickly and see why it is useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lambdas</strong>. Have arrived in mainstream OO as well and students quickly understand the use of anonymous functions to write concise code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Currying</strong>. Tremendously powerful concept, not available in this form in mainstream OO - yes you can hack a workaround which looks like currying but the way it comes across in Haskell is simply beautiful. When telling students that it can be understood as <em>Dependency Injection</em> the penny drops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Definitions</strong>. How can we define data types when there are no objects? ADTs is a very valuable lesson to learn, especially to teach recursive data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pattern Matching</strong>. Probably the most elegant feature of functional programming in general and invaluable to write concise recursive functions. It is still a mystery to me why Java has not properly implemented pattern matching yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lazy Evaluation</strong>. The concept of separating the producer from the consumer is extremely powerful and important on its own, left alone infinite data structures and functions on them. These concepts can be emulated to some extent in OO languages (for example with an <em>Iterator</em> or <em>Streams</em>), however it is nowhere as compelling and pure as in Haskell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Type Classes</strong>. To show students that polymorphism is <strong>not</strong> a unique feature of OO but that it is a fundamental concept allowing to express abstract concepts, facilitating code reuse (among others) and allows to express laws and concepts of a specific type. Students generally understand Type Classes as <em>a kind of interface</em> (in Java terms), which is fine for me and not far from the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functors</strong>. Seeing how to apply already existing functions on types with some structure is a valuable insight. However I do not go too much into the “theory” and leave it at <em>a type with some structure which can be mapped over</em> - this generally blows the students mind anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applicatives</strong>. Probably one of the hardest sells, I motivate it basically through <em>currying within a functor</em>. It is there, where students <em>should</em> get a glimpse what effectful programming means and how it can be achieved in a pure functional language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foldable and Monoids</strong>. Getting more abstract, but folds and monoids have entered mainstream OO in functional stream processing, so students understand that it <strong>is</strong> useful. However the reductionist way that Haskell captures these concepts is perfect to explain it from first principles. Also I think every computer science student should know and understand what a <em>Monoid</em> is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monads</strong>. I spend quite a lot of time building up to and motivating Monads as they capture everything learned so far and allow me then to talk about IO, Concurrency, STM and Property-Based Testing all of which build on Monads in some way. I am not using the do-notation straight away but am forcing them down the way along the »= operator to make it <strong>really</strong> explicit. The main point I make and I discuss at length here (and in IO) is <em>side effects</em>. When you come from a mainstream OO language, your idea about side effects is rather implicit and you have probably not thought about it in such an explicit way as you were forced to when dealing with it in Haskell. This is what I subject the students to and I think it is absolutely worth it: being more explicit about side effects in your thinking, reasoning and your code ultimately leads to better developers and better code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IO</strong> (and do-notation). After pestering the students with explicit »= I show them the do-notation and how to do “real-world” stuff with IO. At this point this is a huge relief for them as they have been wondering for some time now where the promised real-world applicability of Haskell is. The more important insight I discuss and students take away from this is that there are “impure uncontrollable” (IO) and “pure, controllable” (previous Monads) side effects - again this will broaden their horizon and allows them to think even more explicitly and detailed about side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concurrency</strong>. Is generally a very poorly treated topic in CS studies. Students learn how easy it is to write concurrent programs in Haskell using <em>IORef</em>, <em>MVar</em> and <em>Async/Wait</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>STM</strong>. To show students a very different approach to concurrency, making another showcase for the amazing type system of Haskell and how it deals with side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property-Based Testing</strong>. To show students that there is more than tedious <em>Unit Tests</em> (they should be already familiar with). Expressing functional specifications directly in code blows their mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dependent Types</strong>. Going beyond Haskell and showing them whats next and what extremely powerful concepts are lurking in Dependent Types (I am using Idris): Types as 1st class Citizen, Totality, Programs as Proofs, Dependent Functions, Dependent Pairs, Equality as Type, Philosophical Foundations. So students have a rough idea what is possible but which will take decades to arrive in mainstream (if at all).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the future of the course?
I can imagine that I am going to try out teaching Erlang in this course instead of Haskell and see how it goes down - or Rust - or Scala - or Clojure. Each of these languages has unique concepts and also allows to cover a few of the concepts I am teaching with Haskell. However, the problem is that to teach a language and its concepts you need to have mastered it both conceptually and in a real-world context, otherwise the teaching experience will be a shallow one. Unfortunately I can only say that about Haskell, Erlang and Java and I would need to fully and deeply learn other languages if I aim on teaching them. Unfortunately I doubt that I will have the time for that undertaking as it is substantial, therefore I will probably continue with Haskell as it is the language I am very familiar with and will stick with for the next years for real-world software engineering research. Still, just to get some fresh air into the course I think at one point I will try to go with Erlang or Elixir, which would also allow me to capture OO concepts from a functional perspective (how we can emulate subtyping with actors for example).</p>

<p><em>If you’d like to get an Amiga Parceiro for yourself, I explain how you can pre-order one at a heavily discounted rate at the end of the video and this article.</em></p><p>


A couple of years ago I made some videos where I showed my favorite Amiga 1000 setup at that time. It had two main hardware super powers that made it my daily driver. </p><p>

First, a fly-by of a glorious <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmW6LEwgruE">Rejuvenator board</a>, designed by the late Greg Tibbs out of Ohio (RIP Greg). A local good friend of mine here in Seattle named Christian Stich helped me upgrade that board to utilize a rare A3000 Agnus I found that can use 2MB of Chip RAM, which he custom built adapters for it to use. It also has a Kickstart 1.3 ROM chip to accelerate the boot up process and lose the typical Kickstart floppy. </p><div>

<p><em>Christian here is removing the old DRAMs, which were eight 256Kx4 in DIP format. He then installed four custom 1Mx4 in SOJ format  DRAMs with an adapter board that converts them to DIP format.</em></p><p>


The second thing was a hardware combo where I used a Microbotics Starboard expansion made back in 1987 that provided both extra fast RAM (in this case 1Mb), a real-time clock, and a SCSI module called the <a href="https://youtu.be/6BLXxY7FG5M">StarDrive which allowed me to use an Iomega SCSI Zip</a> as an external 100 MB hard drive. It used a custom Workbench boot disk that would pass control from the floppy over to the Zip drive and essentially turn the Zip into a semi-autobooting hard drive, which was a total game changer for that system. For all intents and purposes, that Amiga 1000 became one of my favorite, most treasured systems in my entire Amiga collection. </p><p>

<strong>A1000 equipped Starboard with SCSI Zip 100 as a hard drive </strong></p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BLXxY7FG5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today, as I made the difficult decision to <em>remove</em> the Starboard and Zip drive and replace it with a brand new device called the <strong>Amiga Parceiro</strong>. (Parceiro in Portuguese means “partner”.) So it’s the Friend Partner. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"></p><p>

The Amiga Parceiro was invented over the course of the past year by an Amiga hobbyist named David Dunklee who resides in a small town outside of Colorado Springs, CO. </p><p>

As Dunklee puts it:</p><div>

<p>
Fun Trivia: Mr Dunklee, now retired, was the CIO of the <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/">United States Space Force</a>, as well as an Air Force base commander. You heard that right, Number One. </p><p>


So let’s take a look at Mr. Dunklee’s new device for the Amiga 1000 and see what it can do. </p><p>

At a high level, the Parceiro can do everything my Starboard &amp; Zip combo could do except in a very tidy, modern package. And it can do it all faster and better. </p><div>

<p>
The Parceiro (sounds like par-say-ro) attaches to the side expansion port of the Amiga and is about the size of a harmonica that’s been run over by a steam roller as it’s only about 1/3 of an inch thick.</p><p>

It provides the following features: </p><ol><li> 8MB of Autoconfig Fast RAM. It is a single 8MB of SRAM versus DRAM, so it really and truly is indeed fast with zero wait states.</li> 
<li> Coin-cell battery backed Real Time Clock (RTC), which comes with its own clock software that gets put into your startup sequence.</li>
<li> SD Card Reader with 2GB MicroSD. It comes pre-formatted with the FAT32  file system and is readable on any PC as a result. This way you can quickly set up your new SD-based hard drive.</li></ol> <p>

It’s worth mentioning that this is running on period correct Amiga OS 1.3, too. </p><div>

Possibly the best unseen feature is the silkscreen prints Dunklee put around the various chips and resistors on the board. It’s a complete sci-fi treasure trove of labelling, from Back to the Future to Battlestar Galactica. </p><div>

For his fantastic creativity on the silkscreen, I half-jokingly suggested to Mr. Dunklee a future 3D printed case in clear acrylic so I could totally nerd out with his hilarious labels. And I think he might actually take me up on that idea some day! </p><div>

The Parceiro comes with instructions for creating your own KickWork disk to quickly boot up your machine and install all of the necessary software to run the device. This includes the necessary updates to your Mountlist, Startup-Sequence, adding fat95 drivers as well as the sd.device drivers. </p><p>

The <a href="https://amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=312">KickWork disk idea</a> is based off a product developed in 1988 by Mr. Rudolph Loew (RIP). This is where a Kickstart disk is combined with a stripped down Workbench disk for faster machine boot ups off a single floppy rather than 2. </p><p>

With the Parceiro, Dunklee provides six pages of detailed instructions for getting you up and running in no time. The idea here is the modified KickWork (or Workbench) disk will begin the machine’s boot up process like normal then hand over total control to the SD card like a full-fledged autobooting hard drive. It’s not 100% autobooting, but it’s pretty danged close. And once the machine fully boots you just pop out the boot floppy disk and set it to the side. Mr Dunklee confided with me that in a distant hardware update he might take the next logical step and integrate an FPGA for a true autobooting experience. </p><p>

Since my machine is equipped with a Rejuvenator board, I didn’t need a KickWork disk. So I made a customized Workbench boot disk making the necessary adjustments following Mr Dunklee’s instructions for the RTC software, the SD card device driver and adding the FAT file system library. </p><p>

In the Amiga world, this is about as close to plug-and-play for a device with this many features that I’ve ever come across that doesn’t completely take over your machine and its identity like a Vampire, or some might argue even the ACA500+ (which basically uses the A1000's power to mostly take over). The Parceiro installation was absolutely seamless and I got it up and running without a hitch. </p><p>

Now some of you might be wondering how long it takes to boot this 2GB equipped Amiga. For example, on my Amiga 2000 I have a 40 MB mechanical boot drive, but I also have a SCSI2SD card with 2GB MicroSD for all of my software and data storage. When that machine boots it can sit on a gray screen for about 20 -25 seconds while the large drive is being validated. Once that process is done the A2K snaps to life and I’m on my way. </p><p>

With the Parceiro it’s a very different - and better - experience than I’m used to. The Parceiro still needs to validate the empty space on the drive, but instead it does it in the background. So the Amiga 1000 boots up without that normal long pause. While the background validation is going on, the volume is set to READ ONLY. I can still run programs but I simply can’t write to the drive while the validation is going on. To be honest I wouldn’t even know about this had it not been noted in the instructions, as I’m virtually never writing to the drive the moment I boot it up. And within a few seconds the little Cylon red LED light stops flickering and I know then it’s job is complete (which didn’t directly affect me anyway). </p><p>

Very, very cool! </p><p>

Now, this device is currently in extremely short supply. In fact, I happened to get S/N #1 and I know S/N #2 was sold a few hours after I got mine. At that stage the inventory was sold out. But several more will eventually get made over time so if you’re an Amiga 1000 fan that means you're patient by default. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"> I’d highly recommend you keep this on your radar and try to snag one of them for yourself. It’s simply bad ass and it didn’t require me to upgrade my OS beyond adding new drivers - or really change anything - like a lot of modern upgrades often do.  </p><p>

The Parceiro is a fantastic device, made in the USA, and is a very worthy successor to the Microbotics and Supra offerings from BITD. It is one of the few modern devices that is 100% designed for the Amiga 1000 for a change. And how cool and refreshing is that? </p><p>


<strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><p>

If you’d like to pre-order one of these little technological marvels for yourself at a nearly <strong>20% discounted rate at $195</strong>, simply email <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#387955515f591668594a5b5d514a5778574d4c54575753165b5755"><span data-cfemail="c283afaba5a3ec92a3b0a1a7abb0ad82adb7b6aeadada9eca1adaf">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to declare your interest <strong>and mention AmigaLove sent you</strong>. You will still need to cover expenses for shipping, of course, but you’ll get in line for your very own Parceiro. David Dunklee will manage the rest from there!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The underlying infrastructure of modern networked computing—namely Unix and its derivatives—is approaching fifty years of age.  What will come to replace it?  A strong competitor is the clean-slate “operating function” approach of Urbit.  Jocosely branded as “computing for Martians,” Urbit provides a fresh and updated vision of what Internet computing could come to look like in future years.  Featuring end-to-end encryption and true peer-to-peer routing built on a network-first operating system, Urbit fosters decentralized digital societies and stable user identities.</p>

<p>Our primary objectives in this course are for you to be able to explain and navigate the technical layout of Urbit, as well as construct novel applications for Arvo, the Urbit operating function, using the Hoon programming language.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the schematics and technical implementation of the Urbit OS kernel (Arvo and vanes).</li>
  <li>Navigate and utilize the Urbit ID public-key infrastructure (Azimuth).</li>
  <li>Program literately using the Hoon language, including source code conventions and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Construct userspace apps to run on the Urbit OS platform (Gall, Landscape).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>My target audience for the course consists of graduate students and seniors in computer science and neighboring fields interested in sound computing and functional operating system design (functional-as-in-language).  The course assumes an interest in functional programming but no specific experience<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centzon_T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dchtin">.</a>  <!-- egg --></p>

<p>I wanted to share a story of a segmentation fault I helped track down this weekend. I thought the final root cause of the segfault was interesting because of how unrelated it was to the code I was trying to debug.</p>



<p>I’ve been maintaining a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank">Linux fork</a> of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source">obs-ios-camera-source</a>, which is an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> plugin that allows you to use an iPhone or iPad’s camera and microphone as a video and audio source in OBS. It works in conjunction with the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obs.camera/" target="_blank">Camera for OBS Studio</a>” app in the App Store. This kind of thing is useful for online streamers who want to use their phone’s camera instead of buying a separate camera. For those of you who don’t know, OBS is short for Open Broadcaster Software. A lot of streamers use it to handle broadcasting their stream. It allows you to capture audio and video, mix it all together, do all kinds of cool things with it, and then record the final result and/or stream it to sites such as YouTube and Twitch.</p>



<p>Getting this plugin working on Linux wasn’t really complicated, because it was already well-written without much platform-specific code. After all, the existing codebase was already operational on both macOS and Windows. It mostly just required tweaking a few compile/link options to make the code run happily on Linux.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’m pretty sure a good number of people have been using my Linux port of this plugin without issues. I know it works fine for me when I test with it in Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. I’ve helped people on other distros get it working too. I don’t really do any streaming myself — maybe someday though!</p>



<p>On Friday, GitHub user rrondeau <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" target="_blank">reported an issue</a>: after a half a year of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin working without a problem, it suddenly started causing OBS to segfault on his computer (currently running Fedora 33). He provided a stack trace that showed that the segfault was happening because of something initiated by the plugin. Afterward, he used GDB to get a better stack trace that provided more info about the functions being called and the parameters being passed:</p>

<p>The actual segfault was happening inside of a function called “socket_send” in libsamba-sockets-samba4.so, which was being called by a function in libusbmuxd, which is bundled as part of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin source code and is used for communicating with iOS devices over USB. When I first saw this in the stack trace, my mind thought “Huh…that’s weird. Why does libusbmuxd use Samba’s library for its socket code instead of providing its own?” (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.samba.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.samba.org/" target="_blank">Samba</a> is an implementation of the Windows file sharing protocol used by pretty much every Linux distribution)</p>



<p>I tested and couldn’t reproduce the issue in Ubuntu. I know basically nothing about Fedora, but I faked my way through grabbing a Fedora 33 virtual machine, installing OBS, and compiling the plugin. I ran into the exact same issue that he was seeing.</p>



<p>Before I had a chance to look deeper and understand what was going on, rrondeau beat me to the correct conclusion: code in Samba’s library was mistakenly being called. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" target="_blank">libusbmuxd has a function called socket_send</a>, but clearly <a href="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">libsamba-sockets-samba4’s function that is also named socket_send</a> was accidentally being called instead.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s all we really needed to know. Renaming libusbmuxd’s socket_send function to something else, and updating all references to it to use the new name, fixed the issue. I still wanted to understand why this suddenly became an issue when it had been working fine prior to that. Why were we calling into Samba libraries? Why does an iOS USB multiplexing library even consider talking to a library associated with Windows file sharing?</p>



<p>Not knowing the answer to that question bothered me. I decided to dig deeper and understand exactly what was going on. I started by using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" target="_blank">ldd</a>, which lists all dynamic libraries used by a program or library:</p>


<pre title="">[fedora@fedora33 build]$ ldd obs-ios-camera-source.so 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffa599a000)
	libobs.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libobs.so.0 (0x00007f0a3f688000)
	libavcodec.so.58 =&gt; /lib64/libavcodec.so.58 (0x00007f0a3e2db000)
	libavutil.so.56 =&gt; /lib64/libavutil.so.56 (0x00007f0a3e036000)
...
	libsamba-sockets-samba4.so =&gt; /usr/lib64/samba/libsamba-sockets-samba4.so (0x00007fd6af4b7000)
...
</pre>


<p>I truncated the output because it spit out a very long list of libraries. As we can see from ldd’s output, obs-ios-camera-source.so depends on libsamba-sockets-samba4.so. ldd lists all recursive dependencies as well, and I couldn’t find any references to “samba” in the plugin source code, so this was likely an indirect dependency instead.

<p>At this point I used ldd and readelf to walk through the tree of dependencies and figure out what was actually linking against the Samba libraries. I later learned that I could have installed lddtree (part of the pax-utils package) to do this automatically. Either way, this led me to discover that the Samba libraries were being included through libsmbclient, which was a dependency of libavformat (part of FFmpeg). libavformat is a dependency of libobs.</p>



<p>Repeating this experiment on Ubuntu showed that libavformat on Ubuntu does not depend on libsmbclient. This explains why I couldn’t reproduce the issue on Ubuntu. So why does Fedora’s (well, <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rpmfusion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPM Fusion</a>‘s) version of libavformat depend on libsmbclient?</p>



<p>It turns out that it’s a compile-time option for FFmpeg. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" target="_blank">libavformat contains code for talking with Windows servers using libsmbclient</a>, but it’s an optional thing that you can choose to enable at compile time. Clearly Ubuntu chooses not to enable it, but RPM Fusion does. <a href="https://lists.rpmfusion.org/archives/list/rpmfusion-commits@lists.rpmfusion.org/thread/57UYP4VFY3VCJFU3DGPHLUE3JPYP73HJ/">Actually, I found the exact post on RPM Fusion’s commits mailing list</a> where the patch was added for enabling SMB support in FFmpeg. This patch is what led to the whole issue happening. If Ubuntu’s version of FFmpeg was being built with SMB support, we would have seen this a long time ago. This commit to RPM Fusion was made on December 31, 2020, which explains why rrondeau had only recently begun seeing the problem.</p>



<p>The root cause here is that the obs-ios-camera-source plugin was linking against two libraries that both provided a function named socket_send: libsamba-sockets-samba4 (indirectly through libobs) and libusbmuxd. libusbmuxd was being linked statically, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" target="_blank">that doesn’t prevent functions in it from being resolved through dynamic linking rules anyway</a>. So even though libusbmuxd was a static library with its own internal implementation of socket_send, it was using …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-content-content"><p>Caloric restriction is the practice of taking fewer calories than total daily energy needs. Caloric restriction without malnutrition is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous species. It has been proven to reduce oxidative stress through various pathways and a growing body of evidence shows that sustained periods of caloric restriction without malnutrition improves risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders in humans. (Weindruch, 1996)</p><p>But chronic caloric restriction is difficult to sustain and newer dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have emerged as alternative approaches that still improve markers of aging. The most popular type of caloric restriction applied today is a 16:8 Time-Restricted Feeding schedule i.e. no eating for 16 hours, eat for 8 hours. While difficult for some to get started, Intermittent Fasting is generally easy to adopt and has important short and long-term health benefits such as metabolic, cardiovascular, and digestive health benefits. </p><p>Multi-day fasting is another form of fasting with a higher detoxifying effect that activates important an important cellular restoration process called autophagy. Autophagy is a super useful process that recycles, cleans up, and rids your body of damaged and misfolded proteins. When your cells are constantly fed, they aren't worried about efficiency and restoration - they're thinking that 'times are good, we don't need to work hard anymore.' In a well-fed state, your cells are only concerned with growing. Besides putting all their emphasis on growth, your well-fed cells also turn other genes off such as those related to fat metabolism, stress resistance, and damage repair. </p><p>During fasting (starvation), things are very different. We have a well-preserved starvation “program” that kicks our cell into a completely different state when food, particularly glucose or sugar, isn’t around. Your body reacts to the newfound stress by waking up cell functions to protect you and as a result, starts acting more efficiently and dynamically. This 'reactivation' of the cellular system leads to lowered inflammation, increases your brain's resistance to stress, and many other important long-term health benefits.</p><h2>So, what happens to your body on a fast?</h2><p>At Basis, we wanted to put the science to the test and really see what happens in real-time to your body when you’re following a prolonged fast. So I volunteered to be the guinea pig by spending last week doing a 3-day water fast and tracking my vitals in real-time with Basis to see the impact it has on my body.</p><p><img alt="Fasting data" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xxkgr6gh5t72/3gyIfqHoGt8Iegl8jOcKxR/2eed6467ced1c30d17ca5fd14d27fbf3/Fasting_real_time_.png"></p><p>The Basis app added an extra layer of health confidence for me because I was getting real-time glucose data from my biosensor and could identify if I was going into a hypoglycemic attack; my wearable was connected to Basis and was giving me real-time heart rate data, and I was tracking my hydration and running a once-a-day urinalysis test in Basis to confirm that I wasn’t dealing with dehydration. In Basis, I was also getting my sleep reports for each night, including a time-specific snapshot of my glucose and heart rate - something of particular interest since more than 40% of hypoglycemic events happen during sleep. </p><p>For data sharing purposes, I also did a pre- and post-fast blood panel. You can see a table with the biomarkers I tested for at the top of this post. I've also provided body composition data because I'm sure most people think of fasting for weight loss purposes. </p><p>Disclaimer: Speak with your doctor before undertaking any type of fasting with or without Basis. Your doctor will advise you if any pre-existing condition or abnormalities in your biomarkers could create complications.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s jump into the Basis real-time data along with an explanation of the cellular process that happens as you hit different intervals in your fast. </p><h3><b>DAY 1</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 75 / High 119 / Average 94 </p><p>Glucose Variability: 10.31</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 49 / High 96 / Average 62</p><br><h4><b>12 hours - Hello ketosis. </b></h4><p>In this state, your body starts to break down and burn fat. This process creates ketones which serve as an alternative energy source when glucose isn’t available. </p><br><h4><b>18 hours - Fat-burning mode.</b> </h4><p>I'm now generating significant ketones and I can now begin to measure blood ketone levels above baseline values. Under normal conditions, the concentration of ketones in your plasma ranges below 20 mg/dL but when you fast this concentration can reach 80+ mg/dL. My ketones measured at 32 mg/dL compared to 80 mg/dL for my glucose. </p><br><h4><b>24 hours - Autophagy</b></h4><p>Autophagy can only happen when your glucose stores are significantly low. In humans, that usually happens after 24 hours of fasting. (Alirezaei et al., Autophagy 2010)</p><h3><b>DAY 2</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 107 / Average 85 </p><p>Glucose variability: 9.96</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 45 / High 97 / Average 62 </p><br><h4><b>48 hours - Peak growth hormone</b> </h4><p>Growth hormone helps preserve lean muscle mass and reduces fat tissue accumulation, particularly as we age. It also appears to promote wound healing and cardiovascular health. After two days of fasting, the large number of circulating ketone bodies and the impact of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, promote increased growth hormone secretion (Hartman et al.,1992). </p><p>At this point in the fast, my glucose line is virtually flat, ranging between 75 - 85 mg/dL and I'm preserving my energy for essential activities and work. </p><h3><b>DAY 3</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 90 / Average 78 </p><p>Glucose variability: 8.27</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 50 / High 120 / Average 64 </p><br><h4><b>72 hours - Checkpoint. </b></h4><p>At the 3-day mark, I've hit a key milestone in cellular regeneration. My body has broken down old immune cells and generated new ones (Cheng et al., 2014). Getting those Covid defenses up! Interestingly, through this same mechanism, prolonged fasting for at least 72 hours has been shown to also preserve healthy white blood cell or lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing chemotherapy. </p><p>Last ketone measurement before breaking the fast. Approaching the 80 mg/dL along with a 79mg/dL glucose level measurement.  </p><br><h4><b>Bonus stage: Refeeding!</b></h4><p>The fast isn’t done until you get some food back in your body. The most important thing to remember is that you should resist the temptation to chow down on a pizza or a burger because as amazing as that may seem in the moment, and trust me the temptation is always there, after 3 days of just sipping on water, it will feel absolutely terrible afterward. Your stomach has for all-intensive purposes shrunk and hasn’t gone through the process of digesting anything for 3 days. You’ll get bad stomach cramping and spend quite a bit of time in the bathroom if you eat a carb-heavy meal. </p><p>Beyond this practical reason, it’s important to break your fast with a nutritious, balanced meal that will further enhance the all-around cell and tissue health-boosting exercise you just undertook. </p><h3><b>Looking for a clearer view of your health?</b></h3><p><a href="https://basishealth.typeform.com/to/ovy5RnER">Sign up</a> for the Basis Early Access Beta and discover what having real-time access to your health data means. </p></div></div>]]>
