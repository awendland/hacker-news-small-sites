                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!

[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late.

    <h2>A Terse Guide on Hiring Your First Engineering Manager</h2>
  </div><div>
    <p>Hiring an early-stage manager can bring up powerful fears of making a bad hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if they ruin our culture?</li>
  <li>What if we lose good people because of them?</li>
  <li>What if they cause harm?</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>This mindset can lead to fear-driven-development of the job description. The “what-ifs” turn into a laundry list of requirements without much coherence between them, and this leads to stressful hiring experience both for the candidate (who feels like they need to be superhero to succeed) and for the folks doing the hiring (who feel like they might never find the right person.)</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-manager">What Makes A Manager?</h2>

<p>When it comes to defining a manager’s role, I encourage people to start with a simple baseline: Look for someone who is effective at <em>performance management.</em></p>

<p>That term might make you cringe depending on your experience. However, <a href="https://www.alancolquitt.com/book">modern performance management</a> is quite a bit different than the discipline that spawned the term decades ago.</p>

<p>This is a whole topic in its own right, but for our purposes, let’s define performance management as “bringing people and resources together to make the right things happen.” It’s simple, but it’s hard!</p>

<p><em>TL;DR The baseline for an effective manager is that they can lead their teams in getting from “why” to “what” to “how”</em>.</p>

<p>An effective performance manager has competency in three areas:</p>

<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>

<p>They understand and contribute to the company’s strategy at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See it as their job to understand and represent what the business is doing (in their area, at least)</li>
  <li>Help their reports and peers to understand that direction for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeing their job as “protecting” their team from “the business”</li>
  <li>Talking about “the business” like a foreign entity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>They can lead their team from “why are we doing this?” to “what are we doing?”</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead teams in designing solutions to problems</li>
  <li>Contribute well as peers with other disciplines (product management, design, etc.)</li>
  <li>Effectively guide people through conflict as it arises</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing their teams as “order-takers” for product management / design / etc</li>
  <li>A need to control rather than influence (e.g. requiring direct reporting lines to any area where they need to get things done)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>They get results. This means going from “what are we doing?” to “we’re doing it!”</p>

<p>More specifically, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the right things done</li>
  <li>Use simple, understandable measurements to know that the right things are getting done</li>
  <li>Continually grow and resource their team</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogmatic belief in a particular project-management process</li>
  <li>Shying away from taking ownership of outcomes</li>
  <li>Can’t hold multiple priorities in balance with one another (e.g. treats people terribly to get results, or sacrifices results to treat people too gently)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this">How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>Starting with this short list of capabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a couple of other things that are important to the job (e.g. technical skills)</li>
  <li>Use the list of capabilities you came up with to write the job description</li>
  <li>Build an interview to test for these things</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more detail, <a href="https://mikedebo.com/work/2020/11/06/hacking-structured-interviewing-for-jobs-you-dont-understand/">I wrote a guide on hiring for jobs you don’t understand well</a> that should help you put it all together.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="q-why-isnt-there-a-communication-section-isnt-that-an-important-skill-for-a-manager">Q: Why isn’t there a “Communication” section? Isn’t that an important skill for a manager?</h3>

<p>It is common to test for communication directly. However, I don’t think it’s specific enough.</p>

<p>Think for a moment: Have you worked with a manager who was great at communicating with other engineering teams, but struggled in group sessions with product management, design, marketing, or other roles?</p>

<p>How about someone who was great at storytelling, but who had a hard time communicating how to turn that idea into reality?</p>

<p>These are all different types of communication, but they happen in different contexts.</p>

<p>The person who does well with their teams but poorly with product and design may be more comfortable with <em>making progress</em> than with <em>creating alignment.</em> Our storyteller may be great at communicating <em>direction</em> but not so good with the rest.</p>

<p>None of these gaps are necessarily deal-breakers on their own, but they do paint a clearer picture of where manager’s strengths might lie, and this extra specificity might help you make a better hiring decision.</p>

<h3 id="q-this-directionalignmentprogress-stuff-sounds-a-bit-fluffy-arent-there-better-words-for-it">Q: This direction/alignment/progress stuff sounds a bit fluffy. Aren’t there better words for it?</h3>

<p>I tend not to use these directly with folks unless I’m explaining the underlying model. When talking about it with everyone else, you can use something like “Strategy”, “Focus”, “Execution”; or, even more simply, “Why”, “What”, and “How”.</p>

<h3 id="q-you-havent-spoken-about-leadership-at-all-arent-leadership-qualities-important-in-a-manager">Q: You haven’t spoken about leadership at all. Aren’t leadership qualities important in a manager?</h3>

<p>This is a big topic. In short, my experience is this: It takes a lot of experience and pain to become a strong leader. There are some really interesting, deeply-thought-out leadership programs out there (e.g. <a href="https://coactive.com/training/leadership-training/">Co-Active Leadership</a>) but even those will push their trainees into different forms of suffering to develop their character.</p>

<p>Performance management, however, is a pretty distinct set of skills that can be learned quickly with some dedication. I think it’s a lot more reasonable to find someone who has these skills (or who can develop them on the job) than to expect them to have a lot of difficult-to-acquire leadership qualities, especially for front-line managers who tend to be earlier in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="need-help">Need Help?</h2>

<p>I like talking about hiring. Ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedeb0">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dibernardo-5b19189/">LinkedIn</a> if you’d like to chat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives, so there are parallels between the two open source projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers …</p></section></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix of development, email, and other things an <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly">open-source maintainer</a> does day-to-day.</p>
<p>The typical first reaction that you get when using this is "it runs my Docker stack without sounding like a plane taking off??".</p>
<p>It's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the ARM architecture is the future. A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html">buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank</a>) and Amazon (deep investment in the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton processors</a>) are the two that primarily come to mind.</p>
<p>As you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.</p>
<p>My Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>All the software I need to use "just works". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>
<p>The tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Chrome (native)</li>
<li>✅ 1Password (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Zoom (native)</li>
<li>✅ Backblaze (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Signal (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Spotify (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code Insiders</a> and works really well.</li>
<li>✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker App for M1</a>, which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast.

<h2 id="howtotellwhatarchitectureaprogramisrunningas">How to tell what architecture a program is running as</h2>
<p>It's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says <code>Apple</code>, it's ARM. If it says <code>Intel</code>, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img1.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process">
<img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img2.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process"></p><p>If you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type <code>uname -m</code>. It'll say either <code>X86_64</code>, <code>arm64</code> (mac) or <code>aarch64</code> (linux). <code>arm64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> are both ARM - <code>uname</code> on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img3.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'"></p><h2 id="brewissues">Brew issues</h2>
<p>One issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">MacStadium MacMini</a> instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>
<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>
<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>
<h2 id="usingdocker">Using Docker</h2>
<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>
<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/thajeztah">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499"><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png" alt="We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture."></a></p>
<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown"></p><p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img4.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms"></p><p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href="https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>
<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>
<h2 id="usingvscode">Using VS Code</h2>
<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>
<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just that good). In some situations, this led to some strange issues when running Docker, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Did your last Yubikey just break? Perhaps you forgot an offline backup password. Maybe you're just tired of <a href="https://gist.github.com/grugq/03167bed45e774551155">living like a spy</a> and never using smartphones. Whatever it is, you're here, and you're finally ready to <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp">give up on PGP</a>. That's great!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gtank.cc/content/images/2019/02/225357.jpg"><figcaption>We're here to help!</figcaption></figure><p>No one was sending you encrypted emails anyway, so that's easy enough. But the most widespread uses of PGP are machine-oriented, for needs like package signing and local file encryption. I recently got into this again on a thread that mentioned <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30141">deprecating Go's OpenPGP package</a> and people always ask the same question: if not PGP, then what?</p><p>The thing is, there can't be a direct modern alternative to PGP. It's a do-everything design that predates modern cryptographic engineering and hasn't worked out well. The "modern alternative" is to use a much more specific and much less configurable solution to your problem.</p><p>Here are the most common uses of PGP and their modern, focused alternatives.</p><h2 id="signatures-for-os-or-package-updates">Signatures for OS or package updates</h2><p><strong>Original need:</strong> <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu#0">Linux distributions</a> and many other software update mechanisms use PGP signatures to prevent malicious mirrors or network attackers from altering the contents of their packages.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative:</strong> a lightweight signing tool like OpenBSD's <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify">signify</a> or <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>, either of which you could quickly build in Go using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519">x/crypto/ed25519</a>. I wrote one as a <a href="https://github.com/gtank/sshsign">party trick</a> last month – it's less than 200 lines of code and that includes some silly key parsing tricks.</p><p>These tools are extremely simple and robust because they only support one algorithm, lack state or any notion of a keyring, and are usually decoupled from complex messaging formats (which should be a separate concern from your signature cryptography). As a bonus they're mostly compatible with each other because the keys are all <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA</a> keys. Need I even mention that EdDSA is much, much faster than RSA?</p><p>If you're a maintainer of self-serve packaging infrastructure or otherwise have more complex needs, you should take a look at <a href="https://theupdateframework.github.io/">TUF</a>. It's a modern toolkit meant to resist all kinds of update-related attacks that PGP signatures simply don't address. For an idea of how it works in practice, check out the designs for Python's package infrastructure (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/">PEP 458</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/">PEP 480</a>). The <a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary">Notary project</a> is a productionized and audited implementation.</p><h2 id="encrypting-data-blobs">Encrypting data blobs</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You want to store individual pieces of data without making their contents accessible to anyone else on your system. For some reason this isn't built into operating systems yet, so programs like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> use PGP.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box">nacl/box</a> and <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox">nacl/secretbox</a>. These are general-purpose replacements for encrypting any kind of data. They support public-key and secret-key encryption, respectively, and both use secure modern modes and ciphers.</p><p><a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> made a very solid attempt to specify nacl in a storable message format with <a href="https://saltpack.org/">saltpack</a>, which has a good Go implementation using the above x/crypto package. It works as a nearly drop-in replacement anywhere you were using ASCII-armored PGP data.</p><h2 id="sending-files-securely">Sending files securely</h2><p><strong>Original need: </strong>You have files that you want to send to another person, but you don't want the data to be visible in transit or stored in the cloud. For this, folks often attach an encrypted ZIP file to an email.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative: </strong><a href="https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html">magic-wormhole</a>. If you need to send files to another person securely, use this. It's based on a modern cryptographic technique called <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">PAKE</a>, which basically means it keeps your data safe in transit while giving an attacker no chance to crack the password. It generates those passwords for you, and they're short, one-time-use combinations of three English words – all your recipient needs to do is enter the words. There's nothing to remember long-term and no account information to lose in a data breach. Wormhole also works through firewalls and optionally supports Tor.</p><p>We live in the future. There are better options than emailing encrypted files around.</p><h2 id="something-else">Something else?</h2><p>What's your lingering use case for PGP? Hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/gtank__">on Twitter</a> or send me <a href="mailto:blog@gtank.cc?subject=I'm%20still%20using%20PGP">an email</a> and let's talk about getting you off PGP for good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>February 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewilson">Jesse Wilson</a> once said to me:
          </p>
          <p>

“What if we could give customers a button. They’d press it at the end of the year and it would automagically file their taxes for them.”
</p>
<p>
At the time I thought the idea was appealing, but didn’t think much more about it. Today, I think this is the way TurboTax gets dismantled. It’s taking consumer finance companies with massive distribution, combining them with a tax preparation API and real-time visibility into users tax position. Tackling TurboTax head on is probably a waste of money. Tackling TurboTax asymmetrically has a real shot.
</p>

<h2>TurboTax is functionally a monopoly</h2>
<p>
From the outside looking in, TurboTax has a near impregnable moat. In taxes, there’s no clear second player with near the level of distribution, automation, community, trustworthiness, brand recognition and regulatory capture that they have. They’re incredible at playing regulatory defense by constantly and subtly opposing any government efforts to simplify taxes[1], which simultaneously makes their product more valuable and raises the bar for new entrants. Even the Justice Department recognizes TurboTax as a functional monopoly, and forced Intuit to sell CreditKarma Tax in order to complete the acquisition.[2]

They’re also strong at sniping competition early, before it becomes a serious threat. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130808/a-techstars-first-startup-goodapril-gets-acquired-before-demo-day/">GoodApril</a> is an example; the company went through TechStars in 2013 and was focused on tax planning, initially for gig economy workers. Intuit acquired them before demo day, pre-empting their Series A.[3] 
</p>
<p>

More recently, from the outside looking in, you’d think they missed CreditKarma Tax by acquiring Credit Karma and selling the tax business to Cash App. I think more likely, CK gained scale before threatening Intuit by launching the tax product. The acquisition was at least valuable for a) securing CK’s distribution for TurboTax’s use and b) reducing the likelihood that a good competitor would emerge. You might bet that Cash App successfully executes on the transaction, but it’s at least not a guarantee, from Intuit’s perspective. 
</p><p>

TurboTax also owns the namespace for consumer taxes. Every year between January and April they become the top finance app and a top 10 app in the US Appstore. It’s possible someone builds a better direct to consumer product focused on tax prep, but I’m skeptical.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <img src="https://kunle.app/images/demand.png">
          </p>
        <p>
            All things considered, I think TurboTax is a fantastic business, and will be tough to compete with head on. It’s more likely that the following pieces come together to obviate TurboTax.
</p>
          <p>

Consumer finance distribution + tax prep API + differentiated tax planning (eg real-time tax computation)


        </p>
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
Unseating TurboTax has been hard historically for a few reasons.
</p>

<h3>Superb distribution</h3>
<p>
As a startup, you have a 3.5 month window every year to acquire tax customers. During tax season, TurboTax already dominates the organic acquisition, Appstore rankings and paid acquisition channels. They’ve been doing it for years, they’re probably quite efficient, and you’re not going to outspend (or smartly out acquire) Turbotax from New Years day to tax day. [4]
</p>
      <div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/appstore.jpeg">
        </p>
        
      </div>
            
          

<h3>Perception &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
Doing taxes well for mainstream consumers is complicated, and the consequences of getting them wrong are both bewildering and material. Every year the tax code gets more complex. This benefits the player who already has internally encoded the complexity, and for whom additional complexity is incremental rather than absolute (starting from 0). Simply put, you have one shot to build customer trust, and if you get it wrong you really screw up the customer’s life. Why would any consumer take that risk? 
</p>
<p>

TurboTax has been doing your taxes for years, already has your previous filings, and will use them to prefill tons of fields for you. All the while, you’ve probably never been audited. It just works.
</p>

<h2>It’s time to build (tax prep software)</h2>
<p>
To defeat TurboTax, a lot of the ingredients exist already. They’re just in the process of being assembled.
</p>

<h3>Consumer Finance Distribution</h3>
<p>
To defeat Turbotax, you need consumer distribution that’s as good or better than what TurboTax has. Without this, they’ll outspend you on customer acquisition every tax season, long before you can make a dent. It helps to already have established consumer trust with an adjacent offering, because if the only benefit of your product is tax preparation, you’ll be forced to acquire customers during tax season and compete head on, and you’ll be outspent.
</p>
<p>
Today, multiple consumer finance products already have the distribution necessary to compete. These include products like Cash App, Chime, Venmo, Robinhood and others, which have wide ranging customer trust and customer bases in the tens of millions each. Crucially, these products acquire customers upstream of tax season - they provide financial services to consumers all year around. They also already have a partial picture into a customer’s financial life, and they’re already thinking about customers’ tax needs. Cash App has taken a first party approach (by buying Credit Karma Tax).

<p>
 
Robinhood has taken a lead gen approach (by partnering with TurboTax). No one’s built on a tax API (because none currently exist). [5] For TurboTax this will be death by a thousand cuts - it will be years before a single player files more taxes than TurboTax. But the top 5 neobanks can drain enough volume to have a material impact.
</p>

<h3>Differentiated Tax Planning: Real time tax position</h3>
<p>
Turbotax is insanely focused on consumer tax needs during filing season. To date, this has been sufficient to win. Over the last 18 months, however, “new” things are possible around taxes that weren’t before. Today, high quality income and tax withholding data is available via API. With this data, you can compute your tax position in real time at any point in the year, which has two core financial benefits; a) you can know your tax liability at any point in the year with reasonable precision, and b) with that knowledge, you can optimize it. For instance, you could build a continuous W2 with Pinwheel’s <a href="https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/reference/pinwheel-api.v1.json/paths/~1accounts~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1paystubs/get">paystubs endpoint.</a>
</p>
<p>
This financial benefit wasn’t possible before the last couple of years, and it’s outside of TurboTax’s wheelhouse, because TurboTax optimizes and monetizes the tax transaction at year end, and essentially re-acquires taxpayers each season. Outside of tax season, I basically don’t log into TurboTax.
</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years, several companies have emerged that provide programmatic, API based access to high quality income and wage data for consumers, including <a href="https://www.getpinwheel.com/">Pinwheel</a> (where I’m invested), <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, and <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a>. I suspect <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/deposit-switch/">Plaid's deposit switch</a> team will eventually offer this as well.


Any consumer finance company can now provide a few foundational benefits to customers: 
</p><ul>
<li>Building the customer’s tax forms (eg W2 or 1099) continuously throughout the year using their payroll data</li>
<li>Providing the user a rolling, real-time view of their tax position (taxes owed, refunds) as they earn and spend throughout the year</li>
<li>Trust from the customer that you’re the right company to help file their taxes at year end. At year end - customers press a button, answer some qualifying questions, and electronically file the taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of these foundational benefits, there’s even more financial benefits that can be built. These are less straightforward, but no less valuable:
</p><ul>
<li><span>Tax refund factoring;</span> providing consumers access to refunds prior to tax season. There’s a bunch of regulatory complexity here and some fraud to account for, including users omitting crucial info to overstate their refunds. </li>
<li><span>Tax optimization;</span> recommending changes to income and spend behavior to improve year end tax liability positioning. This already happens a lot at the high end through concepts like tax loss harvesting and smb expense write offs; it’s just rarer for regular W2 and 1099 earners. In today’s world, by the time you’re logging into TurboTax, you’ve missed any shot at optimizing your tax position. Optimizations include amounts to save in tax advantaged accounts like HSA’s and 401Ks, tax allowances you’re eligible for, etc.</li>
<li><span>Spend categorization for tax purposes;</span> paired with an issued card, you can help categorize transactions and suggest which to save receipts for at year end. Mint and other PFMs focus on transaction categorization for budgeting; no one’s really focused on it for personal taxes. [6]</li>
<li><span>Advance capital gains optimisation;</span> tax loss harvesting tools exist, but with where rates are now there are interesting package strategies to allow customers finance instead of selling assets.[7] This starts with creating a live Schedule D and some scenario analysis tools which show customers their alternatives to getting cash today.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At its heart, this approach reaches the customer for a tax use case upstream of when TurboTax acquires them. This means a) you’re not competing at the time of year when TurboTax’s acquisition dollars will drown you, and b) you’re acquiring the customer mid-year, before taxes consume their attention. The best time to optimize your taxes are long before you have to pay them, and neobanks are well placed to provide this benefit.
</p>

<h2>What’s missing: tax preparation as an API</h2>
<p>
Today, there are lots of companies providing tax filing APIs, that would allow a tax preparer electronically file taxes that have already been prepared. From what I can see, no one’s building an API that manages the preparation of taxes. At a minimum you need a system that 
</p><ul>
<li>takes the various inputs (1099, W2 etc) and computes a tax position
asks a series of leading questions to learn more about the consumer (things like whether you’re married, head of household etc) to improve the tax …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>The Korean Stockholders’ Alliance is located in Yeouido, Seoul’s financial and political district, on the fifth floor of an officetel building mostly occupied by financial companies. Jung Eui-jung, the 62-year-old head of the Alliance and the sole resident of its office, points out the window to a large, bright-yellow bus parked outside on Eunhaengro (“bank street”), so named because it is home to South Korea’s two main state banks. The Alliance is an advocacy group that represents retail investors, with around 41,000 members. Its current mission statement is displayed in block letters on the side of the bus: “I hate short selling!”</p>



<p>Jung unveiled the bus at the end of January, not long after retail investors in the U.S. gathered on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets to drive up the share price of the video game retailer GameStop by 1,700% in a meme-fueled challenge to hedge funds who had shorted — in other words, bet against — the company’s stock. Helmed by a single driver, the Stockholders’ Alliance bus shuttles between Gwanghwamun, a public plaza often used for protests, and Yeouido, passing the stock exchange, financial regulators, and the National Assembly, in the hopes of igniting a similar movement in Korea.</p>



<p>Retail traders like Jung say that short selling is an exclusionary method of profiteering used by hedge funds to drive down stock prices and run roughshod over the little guys. That’s why the “David vs. Goliath” narrative surrounding GameStop has been so enthusiastically received by small investors in South Korea, who are known locally as “ants” — a nickname that captures their underdog identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not a lot of people really knew what short selling was,” said Jung, who founded the Alliance in 2019. “But the GameStop incident provided the spark of curiosity and awakened the public to the problem.”</p>



<p>As the story made local headlines, it stirred talk of a Korean copycat movement online. On Naver Cafe, the South Korean equivalent of Reddit, Jung later named the Alliance’s anti-short-selling campaign “kstreetbets.” The forum is where most of the group’s organizing — planning protests, petitioning regulators, and writing letters to lawmakers — is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As South Korea undergoes a <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/979164.html">retail trading boom</a> during the pandemic that has sent the country’s benchmark KOSPI index to record highs, this sort of activism has turned ants into a symbol of “<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/982101.html">economic democratization</a>” and an unlikely political force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure from retail traders like Jung pushed the government to extend a temporary ban on short selling, which was initially imposed in March of 2020. Now, with the current ban set to expire in May, Jung is campaigning for an additional <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/2021/02/02/L67EV46KXBGGDEWOIAGAPSI2EU/">year-long extension</a>, if not an outright abolition of the practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>South Koreans have historically tended to steer clear of stocks, preferring to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/04/03/2020040302464.html%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259A%2525B0%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%25259D%2525BC%2525EC%252597%252590%2525EC%252584%25259C%252520%2525EA%2525B0%252580%2525EA%2525B5%2525AC%2525EB%25258B%2525B9%252520%2525EB%2525B6%252580%2525EB%25258F%252599%2525EC%252582%2525B0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EC%252582%2525B0,%2525EC%25258B%2525AC%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%25258F%252584%252520%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%2525B9%2525A0%2525EC%2525A7%252580%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">invest in real estate</a>. Recently, however, government curbs on property investments, stagnant wages, low interest rates, and high property prices have left people searching for a quicker buck. Jung estimated that the number of active ants has increased from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html">6 million to 10 million</a> over the past year alone.</p>



<p>Much of that increase has been among <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">millennials</a> — known as the “2030 generation” — who are <a href="http://economy.chosun.com/client/news/view.php?boardName=C03&amp;page=3&amp;t_num=13609701">approaching stocks</a> with a generational pessimism, embodied in <a href="https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2021/society/article/6076397_34873.html">terms like <em>yeoung-ggeul</em></a><em> </em>(a Korean portmanteau that translates to “scraping together your soul to invest”) and <em>bittu</em> (taking out debt to invest). <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">Shunning conventional long-term investment vehicles</a> like index trackers or exchange-traded funds, they <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html%2523:~:text=%2525EA%2525B1%2525B0%2525EB%25259E%252598%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25259D%252580%25252065.8%252525%2525EB%2525A1%25259C,%2525EB%2525B0%2525A9%2525EC%25258B%25259D%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B0%2525B8%2525EC%252597%2525AC%2525ED%252595%252598%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">have</a> preferred to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">buy and sell their stocks directly</a>, seeking mid-to-high returns. For many, according to one <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">poll</a>, stocks <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/1Z5HQ1TAEZ">represent</a> a ticket to home ownership.</p>

<p>Technology has also lowered the barrier to entry since Jung began investing in stocks as a salaryman bank worker in the mid-1990s. The new wave of retail investors tends to gravitate toward easy-to-use <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-retail-trading-army-has-been-roiling-korean-stocks-for-months">brokerage apps</a> with low commissions and to finding trading strategies and tips online. “Back in the day, you’d study by reading books about stocks, but now the overwhelming trend is watching YouTube videos, especially for the 2030 generation,” Jung said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has brought its own perils. YouTube can be a valuable resource for the wise, but a minefield of fraudulent advice for the gullible. In legally ambiguous KakaoTalk or Telegram group chats known as “<a href="http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/48901.html">leading rooms</a>,” anonymous stock tipsters (“leaders”) sweet-talk credulous ants with promises of windfall profits before bilking them. Some leaders <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2021/01/39881/">turn out to be running pump-and-dump schemes</a>. Or “they’ll pull tricks like pretending to be offering a free service before directing you to a room with a subscription fee,” said Jung, who noted that he has reported some of the chat rooms to financial regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jung is also concerned by what financial experts have <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/03/06/2017030603181.html">cautioned</a> is the tendency of ants to go after risky, short-term bets. “South Korea might have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but our level of financial literacy is very poor,” said Jung. “Ants do a lot of quick-hit trading — selling when prices rise a little but also when prices drop just slightly.” One popular <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23875703">rule of thumb</a> for young ants has been “hitting five,” or cashing out whenever you reach a 5% return or make $45 (50,000 won) in profit. Many have also turned to margin trading, essentially borrowing money to buy stocks, which has recently become <a href="https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0102_202101181804220081">more popular</a> than ever. With the Korean stock market <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425122_Why_are_Korean_markets_so_volatile">notoriously volatile</a>, investors can easily end up losing more than they put in.</p>



<p>But when the ants work together, they can move markets. Last March, foreign and institutional investors, worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sold off a combined $46 billion (50 trillion won) of the benchmark KOSPI, pushing the market down to a dismal 1,457.64 points. <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/977810.html">Ants countered</a>, buying $43.58 billion (47.4 trillion won), propelling the KOSPI index over the 3,000 mark for the first time in history, in January of this year. The feat has been named the <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/976027.html">Donghak Ant Movement</a>, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Donghak Peasant Revolution, an 1894 uprising of farmers against corrupt government officials and economic destabilization at the hands of foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players. Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The stock market index has historically fallen before rebounding in times of crisis, and it seems like retail investors anticipated this scenario this time,” said Kim So-young, a finance professor at Seoul National University. “Once it became apparent that a lot of them were holding the line, more piled on, causing the surge.”</p>



<p>The ants’ ability to collectively flex their power has given them <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=5090525">undeniable political leverage</a>. In late 2020, the Alliance <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/11/03/2020110302008.html">successfully rallied against a government proposal</a> to expand capital gains taxes on stock investments for the top 5% of retail investors. Since December 2020, over 200,000 people have signed a <a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/595214">presidential petition</a> calling for the abolition of short selling, meeting the requirement for an official response from the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents of short selling argue that it functions as a kind of safety valve for the stock market. By allowing investors to bet in both directions, the practice skims the fat off overvalued stocks and keeps the market efficient. But “the problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players,” said Jung. “Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p>



<p>Short selling comprises only about 4% of total trades in South Korea, compared to around 40% in other major markets, but the point, according to Jung, is the inequality. “The dynamic is always one side disproportionately profiting, while retail investors are losing,” said Jung. “That’s what needs to change.”</p>



<p>Shorting a stock requires first borrowing the shares, which you then later buy back at a lower price to make a profit. Individual investors <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210113116200502%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EB%2525B3%2525B8%2525EC%25258B%25259C%2525EC%25259E%2525A5%2525EB%2525B2%252595%252520180%2525EC%2525A1%2525B0%2525EB%25258A%252594,%2525EB%2525B6%252588%2525EB%2525B2%252595%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B7%2525A8%2525EA%2525B8%252589%2525EB%252590%252598%2525EB%25258A%252594%252520%2525EA%2525B2%252583%2525EC%25259D%2525B4%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">face high collateral rates and fees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/ko-kr/money/markets/%2525EA%2525B3%2525B5%2525EB%2525A7%2525A4%2525EB%25258F%252584%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25258B%2525AC-%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525ED%252585%25258C%2525EC%25259D%2525BC%2525ED%252592%252580%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EB%2525B0%252580/ar-BB1cDqVv">limited selections</a> of shares, and a repayment period capped at 60 days. Foreign investors and institutions, on the other hand, have no fixed repayment deadline — although lenders can technically recall their shares at any time. Moreover, capital gains from short selling are untaxed. Consequently, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/view/2019/12/1054426/">just 1%</a> of short sellers in South Korea are small investors.</p>



<p>Retail investors, particularly those trading on margins, are also uniquely vulnerable to market volatility, which short selling can amplify — particularly in small stocks that are already sensitive to large movements. “There is definitely an aspect of short selling that stokes volatility,” said Kim So-young, the finance professor. “For stock that might not fall as dramatically if it weren’t being shorted, a short sell can exacerbate the decline.”</p>



<p>This has heightened the sense among ants that big institutional and foreign investors can use short selling to siphon money from retail traders. A <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/17/2021011700419.html">recently published study</a> by researchers at Hanyang University found that short sellers in Korea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/short-sellers-under-siege-everywhere-have-it-really-bad-in-korea">averaged about $2 million in daily profits</a> from 2016 to 2019, while investors who traded on margin lost an average of $900,000 per day. “The rule here is that the money flows out from the wallets of individual investors to short sellers,” Jung said. “It’s a staggering gap.”</p>



<p>Although short selling alone is unlikely to cause the index to plummet, some analysts worry that the market is approaching a bubble and that <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210203165200004">overleveraged new ants</a> could soon find themselves in trouble.</p>



<p>Jung said that authorities should use this moment to put in place protections and education for retail investors so that they can better handle volatility. He is also studying the fallout from the r/WallStreetBets incident. Many retail investors lost out as GameStop shares slumped again after the rush was over.</p>

        <hr>
<p>Django 3.2 is just around the corner and it's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2/" rel="noopener">packed with new features</a>. Django versions are usually not that exciting (it's a good thing!), but this time many features were added to the ORM, so I find it especially interesting!</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of my favorite features in Django 3.2</strong></p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Image from the Django welcome page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A lot of great people worked on this release and none of them is me. I included links to the tickets of each new feature to show my appreciation to the people behind it.</p>
<details open="">
    <summary>Table of Contents</summary>

</details>
<hr>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>⚙ Setup local environment with the latest version of Django</summary>
<p>To setup an environment with the latest version of Django start by creating a new directory and a virtual environment:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> mkdir django32
<span>$</span> <span>cd</span> django32
<span>$</span> python3.9 -m venv venv
<span>$</span> <span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>To install the latest version of Django you can either install using <code>pip</code>, or if it hasn't been released yet, install directly from git:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> pip install git+https://github.com/django/django@3.2a1
</pre></div>


<p>Start a new project and app:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> django-admin startproject project
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py startapp store
</pre></div>


<p>Add the new app to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>, and configure a PostgreSQL database:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># settings.py</span>

<span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>'store'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'default'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'ENGINE'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.db.backends.postgresql'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django32'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'USER'</span><span>:</span> <span>'postgres'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To try out some of the new features, create a <code>Customer</code> model:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># store/models.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>

<span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>joined_at</span><span>:</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, create the DB, generate and apply the migrations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> createdb django32 -O postrges
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py makemigrations
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py migrate
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Now add some random customer data:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>string</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>

<span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>__</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>_000</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations! You now have 10K new customers, you are ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="covering-indexes"><a href="#covering-indexes">Covering Indexes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30913" rel="noopener">Ticket #30913</a></p>
<p>Covering indexes let you store additional columns in an index. The main benefit of a covering index is that when a query only uses fields that are present in the index, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">database can use an index-only scan</a>, meaning the actual table is not accessed at all. This can make queries faster.</p>
<p>Django 3.2 added support for PostgreSQL covering indexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Index.include and UniqueConstraint.include attributes allow creating covering indexes and covering unique constraints on PostgreSQL 11+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If for example you are searching for names of customers that have joined during a certain period of time, you can create an index on <code>joined_at</code>, and include the field <code>name</code> in the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>indexes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Index</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>%(app_label)s</span><span>_</span><span>%(class)s</span><span>_joined_at_ix'</span><span>,</span>
<span>                <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,),</span>
</span><span>                <span>include</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,),</span>
</span>            <span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>include</code> arguments makes this a covering index.</p>
<p>For queries that only use the fields <code>joined_at</code> and <code>name</code>, the database will be able to satisfy queries using just the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at__lt</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>.</span><span>localize</span><span>(</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2021</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>explain</span><span>()</span>
<span>... </span><span>)</span>

<span><span>Index Only Scan using store_customer_joined_at_ix on store_customer</span>
</span><span>  Index Cond: (joined_at &lt; '2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'::timestamp with time zone)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query above finds names of customers that joined before February 2021. According to the execution plan, the database was able to satisfy the query using just the index, without even accessing the table. This is called an "index only scan".</p>
<p>Index only scans can be a bit confusing at first. As described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">official documentation of PostgreSQL</a>, it might take some time before PostgreSQL can actually use <em>just</em> the index:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional requirement for any table scan in PostgreSQL: it must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC snapshot [...]. Visibility information is not stored in index entries, only in heap entries; so at first glance it would seem that every row retrieval would require a heap access anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to check if a table page can be viewed by the current transaction is to check the table's visibility map, which is significantly smaller and faster to access than the table itself. It may take some time for PostgreSQL to update the visibility map, so until then you might see an execution plan like this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Bitmap</span> <span>Heap</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>27.07..117.02</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Recheck</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>Bitmap</span> <span>Index</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer_joined_at_ix</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>0.00..26.86</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>Index</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check if your index can really be used for index only scans, you can speed up the process by manually issuing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener">vacuum analyze</a> on the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>VACUUM</span> <span>ANALYZE</span> <span>store_customer</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Executing <code>VACUUM</code> will also <a href="https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unused-index-size#index-and-table-bloat">reclaim some unused space</a> and make it available for re-use.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2020-03-04</em>: I originally suggested using <code>VACUUM FULL</code> instead of plain <code>VACUUM</code>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien_nayrat/status/1367153917239427078?s=20" rel="noopener">A commenter on twitter</a> mentioned that using <code>VACUUM</code> will be sufficient for this purpose, and will be much less intrusive and disruptive, so use that instead!</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that inclusive indexes are not free. Additional fields in the index will make the index bigger.</p>

<h2 id="provide-timezone-to-truncdate"><a href="#provide-timezone-to-truncdate">Provide Timezone to TruncDate</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31948" rel="noopener">Ticket #31948</a></p>
<p>I write a lot about <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts">mistakes in SQL</a> and timezones are usually at the top of the list. One of the most dangerous mistakes when working with timestamps is <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts#be-aware-of-timezones">truncating without explicitly specifying a timezone</a>, which can lead to incorrect and inconsistent results.</p>
<p>In Django 3.2 it becomes easier to avoid this mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new tzinfo parameter of the TruncDate and TruncTime database functions allows truncating datetimes in a specific timezone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous Django versions, the timezone was set internally according to the current timezone:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># django/db/models/functions/datetime.py</span>
<span>tzname</span> <span>=</span> <span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>get_current_timezone_name</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>USE_TZ</span> <span>else</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As of Django 3.2, you can explicitly provide a timezone to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/database-functions/#django.db.models.functions.TruncDate" rel="noopener"><code>TruncDate</code></a> functions family:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>TruncDay</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>timezone</span><span>(</span><span>'America/New_York'</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC(</span>
<span>#     'day',</span>
<span>#     "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'</span>
<span># ) AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A step in the right direction!</p>

<h2 id="building-json-objects"><a href="#building-json-objects">Building JSON Objects</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32179" rel="noopener">Ticket #32179</a></p>
<p>Building JSON objects in PostgreSQL is very handy, especially if you are working with unstructured data.</p>
<p>As of Django 3.2, the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>json_build_object</code> from PostgreSQL</a> that accepts arbitrary key-value pairs was added to the ORM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added the JSONObject database function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interesting use case is serializing objects directly in the DB, bypassing the need to create ORM objects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>F</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>JSONObject</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>=</span><span>JSONObject</span><span>(</span>
    <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'obj'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>()</span>

<span>({</span>
    <span>'id'</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Haki Benita'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2021-04-25T00:00:00'</span><span>,</span>
<span>},)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We already showed how crucial <a href="https://hakibenita.com/django-rest-framework-slow">serialization performance</a> can be, so this is something to consider.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="loud-signal-receiver"><a href="#loud-signal-receiver">Loud Signal Receiver</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32261" rel="noopener">Ticket #32261</a></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="https://twitter.com/be_haki/status/1335921247306264579?s=20" rel="noopener">twitted about a mysterious bug</a> I had that went unnoticed for a long time because it happened inside a signal receiver.</p>
<p>When you use <code>send_robust</code> to broadcast signals, if the signal fails, Django keeps the error and moves on to the next receiver. After all of the receivers processed the signal, Django returns a list with the receivers' return values and exceptions. To check if any of the receivers failed, you need to go over the list and check for instances of <code>Exception</code>. Signals are often used to decouple modules, and handing exceptions from receivers this way defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>To make sure I don't miss exceptions in signal receivers again, I created a "loud signal receiver" that logs exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.dispatch</span> <span>import</span> <span>receiver</span>

<span>def</span> <span>loud_receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>logger</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Subscribe to Django signal and log errors from the receiver function.</span>

<span>    When using `send_robust` to send Django Signals, errors happening in the</span>
<span>    receivers are kept and returned. Because signals are mostly used for decoupling</span>
<span>    modules, the return value from `send_robust` is often dismissed.</span>
<span>    To make it easier not to miss errors from Django signal receivers, use this decorator</span>
<span>    instead to log the exceptions to a specific logger.</span>

<span>    NOTE: Not necessary as of Django 3.2</span>

<span>    Example:</span>
<span>        logger = logging.getLogger('some.logger')</span>
<span>        @loud_receiver(signals.SomeSignal, logger=logger, dispatch_uid='uid')</span>
<span>        def receiver_func():</span>
<span>            pass</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_decorator</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>loud_func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>):</span>
            <span>try</span><span>:</span>
                <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>)</span>
            <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
                <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>exception</span><span>(</span><span>'exception from signal receiver'</span><span>)</span>
                <span>raise</span>

<p>Myrtle called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035254/http://myrtlehocklemeier.blogspot.com/2008/07/article-that-launched-thousand-posts.html">The article that launched a thousand posts…</a>, and counting comments on <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">this</a> <a href="http://rationalmathed.blogspot.com/2008/07/devlin-on-multiplication-or-what-is.html">and</a> <a href="http://www.textsavvyblog.net/2008/07/devlins-right-angle-finale.html">several</a> <a href="http://vlorbik.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/be-fruitful/">other</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/07/teaching_multiplication_is_it.php">blogs</a>, that may not be too much of an exaggeration. Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say. Thus, at the risk of once again revealing my <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/01/31/confession-i-am-not-good-at-math/">mathematical ignorance</a>, I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin’s <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html">multiplication</a> <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_0708_08.html">articles</a>.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher, not as a mathematician. I am not qualified, nor do I intend, to argue about the implications of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">Peano’s Axioms</a>. My experience lies primarily in teaching K-10, from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry. I remember only snippets of my college math classes, back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming.</p>
<p>I will start with a few things we can all agree on…</p>

<h2>We All Agree on Some Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary students will use addition</strong> to solve beginning multiplication problems. What else could they do? They have not yet learned multiplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition</strong>, as our students add up (or count by) the numbers in each row and column. Even adults, when they get stumped by a math fact they’ve forgotten, will use repeated addition to figure out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeated addition does give the correct answer</strong> for any multiplication of whole numbers. Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842? But by using the Distributive Property, any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation:<br>
4 ×&nbsp;3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ×&nbsp;3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts.</strong> This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions. But be careful! To calculate the parts, one needs multiplication — or rather, its inverse, division. So to use this as a definition, one must resort to circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem-solving tool.</strong> Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps <em>wrong</em> is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, <a href="http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-multiplication-is-really-defined-in.html" title="How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic">How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic</a>.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.</p>
<blockquote><p>To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as if there were two types of addition: regular, random, “wild” addition and the specially-bred variety of addition to which we give the name <em>multiplication</em>. Is that really how we want our students to think? Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition. Multiplication is its own animal, an independent operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation of addition has its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/identity-element">identity element</a>. </li>
<li>The operation of multiplication has its <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56032.html">identity element</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every number has its own <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/additive_inverse_number.htm">additive inverse</a>. </li>
<li>Each number has a <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicative_inverse_of_a_number.htm">multiplicative inverse</a>, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34bx2.htm">subtraction</a>.</li>
<li>Multiplication has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34cx2.htm">division</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same, because the operations are not the same.</p>
<p>[Sidetrack: Oops! I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse. <a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7002833&amp;tstart=0">Jonathan</a> pointed out my mistake.]</p>
<p>[Another side note: I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems, just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication. Subtraction plays an important role in the <a href="https://denisegaskins.com/2010/04/12/the-cookie-factory-guide-to-long-division/">algorithm for long division</a>. I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all.]</p>
<h2>Dimensional Reasoning</h2>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Dimensional+analysis">Dimensional analysis</a> means looking at the dimensions (units of measurement) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem.</p>
<p><strong>Addition requires identical units.</strong> The sum must always have the same units as the addends:</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges = ?? </p>
<p>What does that second equation give you? Fruit salad? In order to add quantities with unlike units, we need to find a <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/common+denominator">common denominator</a>. Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit, so…</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges =</p>
<p>2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit </p>
<p><strong>Multiplication requires different units.</strong> The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand.</p>
<p>2 baskets ×&nbsp;3 apples per basket  = 6 apples </p>
<p>How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition? The only way to do it is to change the units.</p>
<p>3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>2 cm ×&nbsp;3 cm = 6 cm<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>We need…</p>
<p>2 lengths ×&nbsp;3 cm per length = 6 cm</p>
<p>We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class. But the fact remains that <em>multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Addition is one-dimensional, but multiplication is multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different. When you add positive rational numbers, you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend. But when you multiply rational numbers, all bets are off — the product may be bigger, smaller, or somewhere in between the numbers.</p>
<h2>Language Does Matter</h2>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> addend + addend = sum. The addends are interchangeable. This is represented by the fact that they have the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> multiplier ×&nbsp;multiplicand = product. The multiplier and multiplicand have different names, even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiplier</strong> = “how many or how much”</li>
<li><strong>multiplicand</strong> = the size of the “unit” or “group”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Different names indicate a difference in function.</em> The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable. It is true that multiplication is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Commutative.html">commutative</a>, but (2&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;3&nbsp;chairs/row) is not the same as (3&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;2&nbsp;chairs/row), even though both sets contain 6&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<h2>A New Type of Number</h2>
<p>In multiplication, we introduce a totally new type of number: the <em>multiplicand.</em> A strange, new concept sits at the heart of multiplication, something students have never seen before.</p>
<p>The multiplicand is a this-per-that ratio.</p>
<p>A ratio is a not a counting number, but something new, much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point. </p>
<p>A ratio is a relationship number.</p>
<p>In addition and subtraction, numbers count how much stuff you have. If you get more stuff, the numbers get bigger. If you lose some of the stuff, the numbers get smaller. Numbers measure the amount of cookies, horses, dollars, gasoline, or whatever.</p>
<p>The multiplicand doesn’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline. It tells the relationship between them, the dollars per gallon, which <em>stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>By telling our students that “multiplication is repeated addition,” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand. But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio, they can never fully understand multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Then Shall We Teach?</h2>
<p>If we accept this argument, if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition, then what? How does that affect the way we teach?</p>
<p>Mainly, we need to change our focus from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now, using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows, pictures of multiplication situations, and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks. But instead of drawing our student’s attention to the <em>process</em> of adding up the answer, we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in <em>equal sized groups</em>. </p>
<p>In other words, we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand: </p>
<ul>
<li>Teach children the useful word “per” and how to recognize a “this per that” unit. </li>
<li>Have them label the quantities in their workbook: 3 cookies per student, 5 flowers per vase, 1 eye per alien, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need a simple, elementary-level catchphrase to replace “multiplication is repeated addition,” how about this? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Multiplication is counting by this-per-that groups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As with any such phrase, this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails. The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers. “Oh, look! We can count just part of a group, and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number.” Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers, complex numbers, and matrix multiplication. Even so, the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K-12: that there is a multiplicand, some “this per that” quantity.</p>
<p>This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know, the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask, “Do I add or multiply?”</p>
<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>
<p>Completing the circle, I come back to the point of <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">my first “repeated addition” post</a>. I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations. These diagrams are used in the <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm">Singapore Primary Math</a> books, and according to <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/09/02/pre-algebra-problem-solving-2nd-grade/#comment-12305">one commenter</a> they are popular in Russia and Australia. They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks, where they are sometimes called “tape diagrams.” </p>
<p>Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, or between multiplication and division. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>What you see above is a tool to reorder the pages of a PDF file, into the order as described by Brent Yorgey <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> (called “Möbius double-sided printing” <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>). Basically, it reorders the <i>n</i> pages [1, 2, …, <i>n</i>] of a PDF file into the order [1, <i>m</i>+1, 2, <i>m</i>+2, 3, <i>m</i>+3, … <i>m</i>, 2<i>m</i>], where <i>m</i> = ⌈<i>n</i>/2⌉, and the final page 2<i>m</i> is omitted if it doesn't exist (i.e., if <i>n</i> is odd).</p>

<p>To use this tool, just upload a PDF file above, then click on the link to download a new PDF file with reordered pages.</p>


<p><i>(In short, so that it requires less mental effort to turn pages, and so that it's easier to look at the next/previous page(s) simultaneously. It's explained by Brent Yorgey on the two pages mentioned above; reproducing part of the explanation here along with his illustrations.)</i></p>

<p>Consider the standard/default method of two-sided printing: for a document with 8 pages, the result looks like:</p>

<p>When printed out as a bunch of loose sheets, this order has two (very minor) advantages over the standard order:
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>When you're done reading a certain page, the way to proceed to the next page is the same regardless of whether you're on an odd-numbered page or an even-numbered page: you don't have to remember, and so at page boundaries you don't have to shift your attention from the contents of what you're reading to figuring out page mechanics. What you do is always the same, namely flip the current sheet of paper and move it to the bottom of the stack:</p>

    <li>When the text refers to the previous or the next page, you can always very easily look at that page or put it adjacent to the current one (so you can see both at once), which with the standard method is impossible when an odd-numbered page refers to its next page or an even-numbered page refers to its previous one. Also, if you just want to glance at the previous page, there is never any page flipping required: just twist your wrist and look at the bottom of the stack. (This is my main reason for preferring this method over the minor variant he calls “Two-way double-sided”.)</li>
  </ol>



<p>The code rearranges pages using <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">pdf-lib</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib">GitHub</a>) (v1.3.0) by Andrew Dillon. I tried to use Mozilla's PDF.js, but its documentation on these “core” matters (as opposed to just rendering a PDF in a canvas or whatever) seems poor/nonexistent compared to pdf-lib, which is excellent.</p>

<p>The idea of printing documents in this way, and the analysis and pictures above, are due to Brent Yorgey (<a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> and <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>, as mentioned).</p>

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>

<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>

    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>if</span> <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Ticks</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>then</span>
      <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>+</span> <span>1_000</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>if</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Wait</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IT BLINKS! Not precisely at 1 Hz, as the ring oscillator isn’t accurate, but close enough for this demo.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

      <p><a href="http://indie.vc/"><span>Indie.vc</span></a><span>, a firm focused on bringing startups to profitability, is shutting down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After six years and nearly 40 startups, one of Silicon Valley’s most unconventional and beloved VC firms is calling it quits, according to a </span><a href="https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09"><span>blog post</span></a><span> by founder Bryce Roberts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re proud of the work we’ve done as investors, brand builders, and movement makers,” Roberts wrote. “We love Indie!...That said, without the institutional support to scale the Indie Economy we envision, it’s time to take our learnings and refocus on other strategies within the portfolio to deploy our capital.”</span></p>
<p><span>Indie.vc became an overnight sensation in Silicon Valley after Roberts (who had been a VC himself for years) published a Tumblr post on what the firm was about back in 2015. Instead of writing founders a huge check for a seed round or a Series A, Indie would use a new investment structure, working with startups on their path to profitability. Roberts didn’t think the concept was so radical — he once told TechCrunch that profitability was more achievable than raising a Series A.</span></p>
<p><span>Indie was part of a wave of founder-friendly VC firms in that they were perceived as not relentlessly marching their investments towards land-grab markets or unicorn-scale growth as fast as possible. Rather, Roberts focused on businesses that were on a path to profitability, and could be helped to get there with an investment that allowed them to not worry so much about their next round. They wanted their investments to have some basis in reality — a product, a corporate structure, revenue — not just drawing board ideas that could either become home runs or strikeouts.</span></p>
<p><span>In this way the fund bucked the trend of most big VC firms on and off Sand Hill Road, where a few monster investments carry along a portfolio of dozens of other bets that may never pan out to a "venture scale" return.</span></p>
<p><span>Several startups to come out of Indie have remained profitable, Roberts wrote, with many generating seven figures in revenue year after year. Indie’s startup mortality rate is 10%, compared with 44% for the rest of venture capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the firm couldn’t continue without more capital from LPs, as many as 80% of whom backed out of supporting Indie. Their reasons usually had something to do with Indie’s break from the VC norm. Roberts even posted an example of the kind of LP rejection Indie often received, which said, “We are out. The shift in strategy for the fund over time (for your good, intentional reasons) has moved further away from the kinds of companies we are looking to have exposure to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After publishing the post, Roberts tweeted about the outpouring of support he received after Indie’s demise.</span></p>
<div><p><span>“You pour yourself into something so completely for so long and then it doesn’t work out how you’d hoped and have to lay bare your failure while bracing for the worst,” Roberts wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

		<p>With the exception of exchanges, scammers, YouTube channels and news sites full of filler and ads, and whales like Michael Saylor, it would seem hardly anyone is making money with cryptocurrency. Despite Bitcoin going from $10k to $40k in less than two months, one is still hard-pressed to find many success stories or evidence of ordinary people getting rich buying and holding or trading crypto. A few days ago I scanned the popular Reddit subs r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency for posts of people who had made sizable sums of money with crypto, and I only found two: someone who had bought a $10,000 Omega watch with their crypto gains, and someone else who made $63,000. Sure, this is better than nothing , but not exactly life-changing amounts of money, especially given how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. By contract, on /r/wallstreetbets there are pages up pages of people making hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars seemingly effortlessly with stock options and with buy and hold. Sure, some on /r/wallstreetbets lose a fortune too, but even in spite of large losses, it would seem that there is far more wealth to be made with stock trading compared to cryptocurrency. It is not even close. I had to dig through dozens of pages to find even just a handful of people who had made a sizable amount of money with crypto, whereas on /r/wallstreetbets it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Where are the millionaires? Surely there must be some. This is not to say that no one has gotten rich with crypto. There are people who bought Bitcoin from 2010-2013 and are sitting on large fortunes. But one would think that there would be dozens of posts every week from newly-minted crpyto millionaires bragging about their gains. One explanation is that bragging this incurs the risk of having your funds stolen, but it is not like you can break into someone’s cold storage wallet from a Reddit account. I imagine that anyone with a fortune would know how to share a screenshot or make a post without compromising their crypto.</p>
<p>So why has crypto been such a loser despite the bull market over the past 2 years, especially compared to stocks? Why aren’t people making money with crypto, but stock trading millionaires are a dime a dozen? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Crypto has too much volatility and hence poor risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks. Whereas many stocks and indexes tend to exhibit a gentle rising slope over the duration of the post-2009 bull market, punctuated by a deep but brief dip due to Covid, crypto tends to zig and zag unpredictably. This is bad for many reasons: too much volatility makes it harder, psychologically, to stay in the market without panic selling at a loss or taking profits too soon. Although bitcoin may have higher absolute returns compared to the Nasdaq , the volatility is considerably higher. This also makes it harder to apply leverage strategies, further minimizing returns. If the Nasdaq has 25% annual returns but 10% draw-downs vs. 50% returns for Bitcoin but 30% drawdowns, you can use 4-1 leverage on the Nasdaq and make 100% in a year with a 40% maximum draw-down, but even applying 2-1 leverage on Bitcoin will give you 100% return but a 60% maximum draw-down. Clearly, stocks provide better risk-adjusted returns with leverage.</p>
<p>Leveraged stock strategies such as buying and holding 3x ETFs such as FNGU,TQQQ, and TECL, have outperformed Bitcoin since 2018. In early 2018, when Bitcoin was at $12k or so, I recommended FNGU as an alternative to Bitcoin (as a sort of high-risk but high return investment). Three years later, FNGU is up over 500% vs. 350% for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. No options market with crypto. Stock options allow small returns of the underlying index or stock to be magnified, but options trading is still very limited with crypto. It is possible, but it does not work nearly as well as stock option trading.</p>
<p>3. Too hard and cumbersome to deposit and withdrawal large sums of and crypto and or fiat. Even after 911, given all of the Patriot Act restrictions, I found it very easy to deposit money in a brokerage account and begin trading. All I had to do was wire money to the broker and within 3 days I was able to trade. With crypto, often you need ID cards and proof of funds due to various arbitrary compliance and anti-money laundering restrictions and regulations. Prior to 2017, it was easy to transfer funds and crypto in and out of exchanges, but criminals inevitably abused and exploited the good will of exchanges. That is usually what happens with these sort of things: all it takes is a few bad actors to permanently ruin it for everyone else. Two decades later, we still have to take off our shoes at the airport because someone had the brilliant idea of smuggling a bomb in their shoe.</p>
<p>4. Too small of position sizes. On /r/wallstreetbets it is not uncommon to see traders in their 20s or 30s make bets of ten thousand dollars or more on a single option trade. Yet for some reason with crypto everyone is skinflint and risk averse. It’s like “I deposited $50 into my Coinbase” is the norm. You’re not going to get rich with such as small investment even if Bitcoin goes up 100x. It is the same age group and demographic buying stock as buying crypto, so it’s not like the crypto traders should have less money.</p>
<p>5. Gains do not hold. GME stock started at $3 in 2020 and a year later is still above $100. Stocks tend to ‘trend’ which means that past price movement predicts future direction. If a stock has risen 70 out of the past 100 days, likely it will keep rising, at least for the foreseeable future. This is known as momentum, and there is evidence that in spite of the efficient market hypothesis, that it exists. With crypto, sometimes an altcoin will get pumped 100% in a day and then the next day give up most of its gains, and then a week later be back to where it started. It is hard to make money off that because there is no follow-through or trend to ride higher. It s not like Gsamestock, which kept going up for many months, or, like Tesla, which went from $70 to $900 over 2 years.</p>
<p>6. As discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-good-investment/">earlier</a>, crypto is more like a commodity than a stock. Whereas stocks tend to generate shareholder value in the form of retained earnings, dividends, or buybacks, crypto does not generate earnings that can be passed on to investors. Also, crypto has more inflation than stocks, as some inflation (between 2-5%) is built into crypto protocols, whereas with stocks the supply tends to shrink over time due to buybacks. Historically, for these reasons, commodities tend to have far worse returns than stocks.</p>

However, I have started noticing that many software development problems might be caused by people being too positive and passionate. Let me explain.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="d047">Isn’t it weird that so many young people are already feeling burnt out after a few years of work? I keep meeting people who need a break after just their first year or two. I’ve also experienced burnout myself (twice even). The first time, I had to take a six-month break. The second time, which was very recent, I needed a full year off before I could come back to programming.</p><p id="41b7">This year, I’ve spent a lot of time with people outside tech and noticed one thing: We don’t complain much about our work. We complain about bad bosses and bad projects, but not about coding itself. We take passion for granted. Surprised? Go through job offers. Passion is often one of the must-haves listed on them. We are expected to love our job, and even more, we are expected to make programming the center of our universes.</p><p id="31ae">But what about the people who do not love programming and still do their job all the same? Try to identify yourself as one of those among your colleagues or on Twitter, and you will immediately be dismissed as being a bad developer. However, is that really the case? People who do their job and try something different after working hours can be amazing programmers too. Not everyone needs to come home and work on side projects, create blog posts and YouTube videos about coding, and read programming books for fun.</p><p id="4a37">I have been one of those people trying to work through all my spare time. For many years, I felt guilty if I didn’t spend all my waking time chasing some imaginary productivity goal — and guess where that landed me?</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman burying her head into her arms" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicotitto?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">nrd</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="61c0">Another aspect that is heavily biased against negative feedback is following new trends originating from FAANG companies. Try to speak up against SOA or Docker. Try to propose using an older, more mature language and SSR. It’s similar to having a passion for work. People immediately conclude that you are not a good developer, as you are “blocking the progress.”</p><p id="85a7">Not everyone is running thousands of microservices like Uber and not every company needs K8S. However, it’s hard not to get on board — or at least pretend to be on board. How many organizations fail to migrate to React or Angular and are left with a code base split between the old “bad” code that was working and the new code that developers are still fighting to make work?</p><p id="0a7d">This recent article shows the reality in many organizations:</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="ddd8">When I was a Technical Lead, I often heard the phrase “because it is a good practice.” I would then ask further questions and often noticed that the person didn’t quite understand the solution. It was my litmus test to know when to dig deeper.</p><p id="ec4f">How many of these “universal” best practices aren’t really universal? DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is often said in the same sentence as KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), yet they are often mutually exclusive practices. “Simple” means no unnecessary abstractions, yet starting with DRY code leads exactly to premature abstractions.</p><p id="9470">I personally use <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">the rule of 3X</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="3f47">“We have the delusion of reuse. Don’t feel bad. It’s an endemic disease among software developers. An occupational hazard, really.</p><p id="371b">…</p><p id="64fa">- It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single-use components, and<br>- A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.” — <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">Coding Horror</a></p></blockquote><p id="6a10">Obviously, I don’t treat it as a maxim. It’s more of a rule of thumb than good practice. But even here, we are getting to the same problem. People who dare suggest using singleton or any other hated anti-patterns are perceived as less than stellar developers.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="dc25">The expectation that <em>real</em> software developers, hackers, and geeks are defined by their vocation feels like being in some sort of RPG game. Your trade will forever define you, and once you choose this path, there is no way back.</p><p id="d74d">We, as developers, are expected to love programming. But why? The simple truth is that it is good for employers. How many horror stories have come out of game dev? Yet many young people dream about working in the gaming industry only to be replaced by another batch of young, naive people after a few years.</p><p id="b875">We need to normalize people not “loving” to code, and we need to normalize having a healthy work-life balance in tech. We need people to be more open about their opinions, even if they are against the moment’s hype.</p><p id="62c6">Don’t get me wrong, I really like being a software developer and I like programming. However, I am not sure if I love it being the center of my universe anymore.</p><p id="e18c">I want to try other things, and that is absolutely OK.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><p>March 2nd, 2021</p><p>Today I am happy to announce <a href="https://github.com/gordalina/hush">Hush</a>, the simplest way to inject secrets into your app configuration.</p><p>Hush was purpose built to solve a common use case for projects that require secrets and want to inject them in a secure way without having to depend on secret files or hardcoded configuration.</p><h2>Background &amp; Motivation</h2><p>As an web applications engineer, I've always been interested in understanding and engineering the whole stack, from managing &amp; configuring servers, all the way up the stack to frontend development. In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a <code>prod.secrets.exs</code> which is used to configure an application in a production environment.</p><p>The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them — this was not an ideal scenario.</p><p>Slab, <a href="https://slab.com/">the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge</a>, discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult — as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.</p><p>As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config &amp; dev/prod parity in the <a href="https://12factor.net/">twelve factor app methodology</a>.</p><p>Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Hush implements Elixir's <code>Config.Provider</code> behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.</p><p>In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.</p><pre><p><span></span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>Hush</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Web</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>http:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>port:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"PORT"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>cast:</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>RedshiftRepo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Features</h2><p>Hush ships, today, with the following features:</p><ul><li>Extensible providers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
	<p>The OpenPush project aims to create a free and open source self-hosted replacement for Android Push Notifications usually sent through Google's proprietary Firebase Cloud Messaging platform. This started as a <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/open-source-push-service-fuer-android-apps/">PrototypeFund project</a>. Development is still ongoing.</p>
	<h5>Concept</h5>
	<p><img width="100%" src="https://bubu1.eu/concept.png"></p><p>The green components (PushClient and PushServer) in this high-level overview are part of this project. The red components are different apps and their corresponding webservices using the push functionality.</p>
	<h5>Benefits</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Free Software.</b> FCM is a proprietary service and the Firebase client libs are closed source. This makes projects including fcm libraries effectively non-free software which i.e. cannot be added to the FOSS <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> appstore.</li>
		<li><b>Self-hosted.</b> When self-hosting a open source project, there's no dependency on an external service anymore.</li>
		<li><b>User is in control.</b> A smartphone user can chose a pushserver instance, possibly self-hosted or hosted by a trusted entity.  This instance's url is communicated to the webservice together with the app token to the push-notification producer. Push-notifications will only be sent to this server.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Talks</h4>

		<p>At Replit we believe that computers give people superpowers. With computers, anyone who's willing to learn can spend more of their time on creative invention rather than tedious drudgery. They help us automate repetitive tasks and build on the collective knowledge of all the great thinkers, inventors, artists, and teachers who came before us. </p>
<p>Computer science teachers around the world are bestowing these superpowers upon the next generation of creators and builders. We built <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Replit Teams for Education</a> for them, and today we're officially taking Teams for Education out of beta. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wgl_ERg23O4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Sign up for a free trial</a> if you haven't already!</p>
<p>Thank you teachers for beta testing Teams, for giving us invaluable product feedback, for helping one another out as part of a vibrant and diverse community of Replers, and for being a part of the history of computers.</p>
<p>William Gibson is famous for saying way back in 1992, that "the future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." If we asked you a year ago, you may have said we were already living in the computer age, or even that we had been for decades. But then in early 2020 COVID-19 happened and everything went "remote" and we all took a collective leap even further into the future. Today it's more obvious than ever that for children (and adults!) to participate in the riches of the new economy, they need to be able to design, control, and program the machines that we all use all day, every day.</p>
<p>On this vision to build powerful &amp; approachable tools that expand access to computing superpowers, Replit raised a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/seriesa">$20 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020. We're using the funds both to make learning more engaging for teachers and students and also to make work more fun and creative for professional software developers. We believe that the same things that make programming easier for beginners will also unlock productivity for experts. And when students know that they aren't just in a sandboxed, toy environment, but instead can use real-world tools and collaborate in real-time with their peers, they'll learn better.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/multiplayerart.png" alt="replit multiplayer art"></p>
<p>We've been working towards this vision since Amjad and Haya started Replit in 2016. And the initial beta release of Teams for Education over the summer of 2020 was a major step forward in that direction. From the start, early adopters like Toni loved the real-time multiplayer collaboration with their students, seeing how Replit could transform their classrooms.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> absolute game changer for coding. Supports so many languages, easy to use. My favourite feature is multiplayer option!

<p>But there was much more to do before Teams would be ready to graduate from beta. We listened to our teachers. Then we rolled up our sleeves and started building fast:</p>

<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/education-privacy">privacy compliance</a> (FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, and more)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">code annotations for feedback</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/group-projects-teams-education">group projects</a></li>
<li>simplified pricing</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-edu-fall-2020-improvements">feedback workflow improvements</a></li>

<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/unit-tests">built-in unit tests for Java, Python, and Javascript</a></li>
<li>project overview and reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're going to keep on shipping! In the coming days and weeks, look out for live handraising to get help, project due dates, easier billing and team organization, major updates to annotations (now called threads), and more. If there's something else you want us to build, <a href="https://replit.canny.io/teams-for-education">let us know</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/threads.png" alt="threads"></p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who's been teaching with Teams for helping us set the product direction. There's still more to do, but Teams for Education has finally reached a point where we're proud to officially release it. We're excited to keep hearing success stories from teachers like Michele and Pete.</p>

<p>But it's not just these couple teachers. In the past 7 months of the beta, we've reached ~1,000 paying Teams customers (and thousands more currently on free trials). We're serving elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities, bootcamps, nonprofits, and every type of educational institution. And the schools using Replit are incredibly diverse with over 30% majority minority and over half with &gt;45% of their students on free or reduced-price lunch.</p>
<p>With so much collective brainpower and experience across our community, we're working hard to connect teachers to one another to share best practices. If you haven't already, <a href="https://repl.it/talk/all">join Repl talk</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/replitforcseducation">our teachers' group on Facebook</a>. We'll be attending the <a href="https://sigcse2021.sigcse.org/">SIGCSE conference</a> in March and would love to see you at <a href="https://repl.it/sigcse2021">our presentation</a>. We'll be at <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/csta-2021">CSTA</a> over the summer as well. More details to come. We'll be resuming "office hours" (video call sessions with our team) in the coming weeks and sending a survey to ask your time preferences. And to help us out on all these fronts, we'll soon be adding another teacher from the community to our team. </p>
<p>Finally, the Replit team is doing a book club, and we'd love to have you join. We're reading <a href="http://friendlyorangeglow.com/">"The Friendly Orange Glow"</a>, which tells the story of programming education and early cyberculture from the 1960s through the early 90s.

March 2, 2021 | https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Kubernetes (k8s) has been all the rage for the last few years because application orchestration has become a de facto table-stakes requirement for production workloads running containers. “Containerising” applications is <em>relatively</em> straightforward, and most DevOps engineers worth their salt can create a few Dockerfiles and build images in a pipeline that are ready to run. But where do you “run” your Docker containers? And which versions do you deploy? And how do all the containers talk to each other? This is where orchestration comes into play and where a few options are proposed by large vendors. There are two main options available at the time of this writing: Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes which is offered by all the Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) providers, including even AWS.</p><p>The hope is that orchestration will allow companies to deliver their containerised applications to test and integration environments quickly and painlessly. The ideal scenario is that it “just works”, that is, you would snap your fingers and wait a few minutes before you see your application running in front of you. Ideally, you’d only need to specify the minimum information necessary to run your application: name, framework, dependencies, and so forth, preferably read out from existing configuration files you already have available. That’s the hope anyway.</p><p>Obviously, from the title, we are focusing on Kubernetes, mainly because it is available everywhere and mainly because the only <em>other</em> option is ECS which only proves the point of our thesis that Kubernetes is hard to use because AWS came up with their own solution that is <em>supposed to be</em> easier. But why is it so hard to use? How long would it reasonably take to get your application(s) running in K8s?? And why isn’t it easier?</p><h2 id="kubernetes-infrastructure-is-hard">Kubernetes Infrastructure Is Hard</h2><p>We always start with the infrastructure even though most companies wouldn’t build their own Kubernetes clusters themselves. If you were ever going to use a managed infrastructure service, K8s would be at the top of the list. I’m sure there are a few people who start up <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" title="Minikube documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">minikube</a> on their laptops and say to themselves, “Wow, this is easy! I can do this myself!!” This reminds me of people who start up an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html" title="Elasticsearch getting started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> container on their laptop and say, “Wow, we should implement this for our website!!” Fast forward to a production launch six months or a year later and the simple “We can do this ourselves” mantra turns into “I wish we didn’t have to do this anymore.”</p><p>If you were truly going to build your own Kubernetes cluster, you’d need to build all the control plane servers and services on your bare-metal or Virtual Machines (VMs) from an IaaS of choice, and then tie them all together with some fancy networking configuration to separate control-plane traffic from container traffic. You’d need to configure and run all of the control plane software and get them all talking to each other, running stably and monitored properly. Perversely, you’d be orchestrating the containers that orchestrate the application, but without a lot of orchestration! The fancy mirage that’s presented when you run minikube or Docker Desktop on Windows hides all the inception of running a container orchestration system using containers.</p><p>We haven’t even gotten to the complications of setting up ingresses (which are just nginx instances, usually) and load balancers that sit on top of or next to the control plane stack. A lot of the time, you’ll feel like you are creating a whole infrastructure just for your infrastructure to run (which isn’t unusual, but definitely doesn’t feel better than trying to orchestrate things yourself). We also haven’t gotten into the Role Based Authentication Controls and network policies that need to be set to support more than a single application or stack running in one cluster. The number of configuration points and server-side setups start to mount quickly and we haven’t even started orchestrating applications yet, which is the whole point of the orchestration system we’re supposed to be setting up.</p><p>And let’s suppose that you really do wade out into this deep North Atlantic Ocean of huge waves and death-inducing freezing waters, and build yourself a production-worthy ship that can orchestrate your containers into an actual application. You look back up at your calendar and it’s been six months or a year since you started, and you’re just now deploying a control plane that says, “Hello World!” You think you’re successful and you’re about to celebrate when you check the releases section on the website and now you have a new version of k8s to deploy!!!</p><p>I hear what you’re saying, “We’re <code>large company</code> and we have <code>lots of</code> DevOps engineers who are <code>top decile</code> of engineering talent in the whole world. We can handle all the heavy lifting. You’re just a whining, jealous baby.” I see you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDm9iNkLyPI" title="Datadog on Kubernetes presentation video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Datadog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg" title="Ticketmaster presents the keynote at Kubecon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ticketmaster</a>. (By the way, your accusations of jealousy might be correct. At the end of my good friend Justin Dean’s keynote speech where he shows the slides with all the team members, my picture should have been up there — but I had left the team two years earlier.) For everyone else, we all just decide to not spend six months or a year trying to build our control plane and start up our IaaS provider’s managed service and cross our fingers and pray.</p><h2 id="k8s-yaml-aint-markup-language">K8s YAML Ain’t Markup Language</h2><p>If you’ve skipped ahead and just started up a managed k8s cluster, you’re still in for a long and tedious journey wading into a deep sea of confusing YAML. YAML is to text what James Joyce’s <em><a href="https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm" title="Read Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Finnegan’s Wake</a></em> is to English. If you close one eye, use only your left pinky and right thumb to follow some brail, put your feet into ballet’s fifth position, and then recite World War II codes under your breath, then you will easily see that YAML is quite a breeze to comprehend. Once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding a bicycle over a frozen lake on centimeter-thin ice with rabid wolves chasing you. It’s as easy as trying to crash the Ancient Aliens cocktail party held in Fort Knox on gold smuggling days.</p><p>Look, it’s not actually that hard, right? Let’s say a guy walks up to you on the street. He’s a k8s expert and he’s going to show you how easy the “hello world” web service deployment is. The conversation goes like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>You: “Oh, I see. Yes, I like it.”</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1beta1.”</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>You: “Uh, okay. Isn’t v1beta1 out of date? You can use v1 as of k8s 1.9.</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>It’s actually removed in 1.16, but I wonder how many people have never</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>updated.”</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Him: “Start over.”</span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>You: “Stop with the Kinds everywhere!”</span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1”</span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>You: “This again.”</span></p><p><span>22</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>You: “Huh??”</span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>Him: “selector:”</span></p><p><span>28</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>You: “No.”</span></p><p><span>30</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>Him: “matchLabels:”</span></p><p><span>32</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span></p><p><span>35</span><span>Him: “app: nginx”</span></p><p><span>36</span><span></span></p><p><span>37</span><span>You: “That’s nearly the first thing I’ve understood about this so far.”</span></p><p><span>38</span><span></span></p><p><span>39</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>40</span><span></span></p><p><span>41</span><span>You: “Again?”</span></p><p><span>42</span><span></span></p><p><span>43</span><span>Him: “containers:”</span></p><p><span>44</span><span></span></p><p><span>45</span><span>You: “Okay, now we’re getting somewhere.”</span></p><p><span>46</span><span></span></p><p><span>47</span><span>Him: “image: nginx:1.14.2”</span></p><p><span>48</span><span></span></p><p><span>49</span><span>You: “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>50</span><span></span></p><p><span>51</span><span>Him: “ports:”</span></p><p><span>52</span><span></span></p><p><span>53</span><span>You: “Aiiiiieeee.”</span></p><p><span>54</span><span></span></p><p><span>55</span><span>Him: “containerPort: 80”</span></p><p><span>56</span><span></span></p><p><span>57</span><span>You: “I’m going home. I quit. There must be a devops job I can get where</span></p><p><span>58</span><span>I work on [Gatsby blogs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "Gatsby nodejs frontend")</span></p><p><span>59</span><span>all day.”</span></p></pre></div><p>And that’s just trying to read and understand the file. Try reading two k8s yaml examples and then generate one yourself from scratch. Even better, every day try a <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Practice a code kata daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code kata</a> practice of writing working and deployable configurations to Kubernetes.</p><p>I DARE YOU.</p><h2 id="copy-paste-aint-code">Copy Paste Ain’t Code</h2><p>I’m still chuckling over the previous section. I have to chuckle because this is the daily pain of my day-to-day existence and facing that pain directly is like standing in front of a bus being driven by Keanu Reeves on the freeway. The only thing that keeps my nose going back to the grindstone is the realization that working with NodeJs would be worse. The problem is that the Kubernetes docs are pretty good. You copy-paste some hello world examples and the outputs look like they work. You start to get pretty good at using kubectl. You can see vague shapes and outlines in YAML. You’re starting to gain confidence that you might be able to do something useful.</p><p>“Let’s try to move our application into Kubernetes!” you yell into the air as you emerge dripping wet from your bathtub wrapped only in a towel, like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-archimede/" title="Learn about the Archimedes fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Archimedes</a> sprinting through the streets of Syracuse. “We’ll just copy-paste some sections from here and here and put them there and there, and we’ll have our app running in no time,” you breathlessly explain to your coworkers. “Does it work?!” they excitedly ask. “Not yet. I mean, no. I need to indent the section and remove one piece that is not used in this spec. Then I need to decide if we use a deployment or a daemonset, but it’s almost there. I swear!”</p><p>First of all, put on some clothes. I’m all for taking a bath while thinking about kubernetes YAML files, but you need to get dressed afterward. Also, if you drop your Macbook Air into the bath with you, the results can be electrifying. I know. Second, here’s a riddle for you: how many YAML files do you think you need to run and deploy your application? Good thing that some people have ten fingers and ten toes because that’s probably how many you’ll need. And they’re all related but not really. You can copy-paste sections around if you’re adventurous and gullible, but you have no idea if the sections are compatible. There are only four required fields, all of which are gibberish, and everything goes under <code>spec:</code> (including <code>spec:</code>). Most of the sections are duplicated but only slightly. They vary microscopically in ways that matter macroscopically.</p><p>Copying and pasting is a wonderful art, and I’ve personally worked my entire adult career that way. I gleefully admit my whole output in life is like a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteNote" title="Example of a Ransome Note trope from movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ransom note</a> cut from stack overflow and documentation examples. But piecing together this fragile web of text to do what …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote><p>One luminary clock against the sky <br> Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p><p><cite>Robert Frost, <em>Acquainted with the Night</em> (1928)</cite></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Time is still the great mystery to us. It is no more than a&nbsp;concept; we don’t know if it even exists…</p><p><cite>Clifford D. Simak, <em>Shake­speare’s Planet</em> (1976)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also time: a&nbsp;repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it doesn’t work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always implies keeping track of time.</p><p>As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a&nbsp;<em>defin­i­tion of time</em>, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to synchro­nizing the state of a&nbsp;global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do you tell the time if clocks can’t be trusted? How do you create the concept of a&nbsp;singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you measure time in a&nbsp;timeless realm? And what is time anyway?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer these questions, we will have to take a&nbsp;closer look at the concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block time — more commonly known as <em>block height</em>. We will explore why the problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why there is no absolute time in a&nbsp;decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” Today, it is again a&nbsp;timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a&nbsp;clock, not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional age. And this clock is Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-things">Keeping Track of Things</h2><blockquote><p>Let the child learn to count things, thus getting the notion of number. These things are, for the purpose of counting, consid­ered alike, and they may be single objects or groups.</p><p><cite>David Eugene Smith, <em>The Teaching of Elemen­tary Mathe­matics</em> (1900)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things: physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts directly, e.g., give someone a&nbsp;sea shell, a&nbsp;coin, or some other tangible <em>thing</em>, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down what happened on a&nbsp;piece of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are a&nbsp;shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock returned home. You can put a&nbsp;collar on each sheep, and as soon as a&nbsp;sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of course, you can also count them and keep a&nbsp;list. However, you will have to make sure to create a&nbsp;new list every time you start counting, and you will also have to make sure not to count a&nbsp;single sheep twice (or not at all).</p><p>Money is essen­tially a&nbsp;tool to keep track of who owes what to whom. Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into two categories: <em>physical</em> artifacts and <em>infor­ma­tional</em> lists. Or, to use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.</p><figure> <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2021-01-14-bitcoin-is-time/ledger-token.jpg"></figure><p>It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first method — a&nbsp;physical token — <em>directly</em> repre­sents the state of things. The second one — a&nbsp;ledger — <em>indirectly</em> reflects the state of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example, tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.</p><p>In the digital realm — no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to convince you of the opposite — we can only use ledgers. It is an <em>infor­ma­tional</em> realm, not a&nbsp;physical one. Even if you call a&nbsp;certain kind of infor­ma­tion a “token,” it is still a&nbsp;malleable piece of infor­ma­tion, written down on a&nbsp;hard drive or some other medium that can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional record.</p><p>The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of the world <em>directly</em>. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to “move” it, you have to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem doesn’t exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can actually move things from A&nbsp;to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn’t have this property. If you want to “move” infor­ma­tion from list A&nbsp;to list B, you have to copy it from A&nbsp;to B. There is no other way.</p><p>Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens are not. I&nbsp;would even argue that “digital token” is a&nbsp;misnomer. A&nbsp;token might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.</p><p>This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to “hand over” infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a&nbsp;digital token like you would pass on a&nbsp;physical one since you can never be sure if the original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens, like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.</p><blockquote><p>… if you have an apple and I&nbsp;have an apple, and we swap apples — we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I&nbsp;have an idea and we swap ideas — we each end up with two ideas.</p><p><cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Physical tokens — what we call physical bearer assets, or “cash” — are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me a&nbsp;coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over. The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.</p><p>While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm — George Parker, a&nbsp;con artist who famously “double-spent” the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks comes to mind — it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with <em>infor­ma­tion,</em> double-spending is an <em>inherent</em> problem. As everyone who ever copied a&nbsp;file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is something that you can copy <em>perfectly</em>, and it is not bound to the medium that hosts it. If you have a&nbsp;digital photo­graph, for example, you can copy it a&nbsp;million times, store some copies on a&nbsp;USB stick, and send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.</p><p>Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There simply is no way to <em>move</em> digital infor­ma­tion from A&nbsp;to B. Infor­ma­tion is always <em>copied</em> from A&nbsp;to B, and if the copying process was successful, the original copy of A&nbsp;is deleted. This is why the double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a&nbsp;central authority, there is no way to move <em>anything</em> from A&nbsp;to B&nbsp;in a&nbsp;trust­less manner. You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A&nbsp;natural side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is <em>impos­sible</em> to tell how many copies are in existence and where these copies might be.</p><p>Because of this, using digital “tokens” as money can not and will never work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to repro­duce as a&nbsp;result of their unique physical construc­tion, this advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm, tokens cannot be trusted. As a&nbsp;result of the nature of infor­ma­tion’s intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not a&nbsp;token but a&nbsp;ledger — which brings us to the problem of time.</p><h2 id="tokens-are-timeless-ledgers-are-not">Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not</h2><blockquote><p>For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</p><p><cite>Paul of Tarsus, <em>Corinthians</em> 4:18b</cite></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a&nbsp;trans­ac­tion does not matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don’t; you can either spend them, or you can’t. The simple act of posses­sion is the only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.</p><p>When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside. Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are <em>in order</em>. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you can’t spend money that you don’t have and you can’t spend money that you have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of a&nbsp;ledger, not physical laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter. Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For example, you can’t simply “make up” a&nbsp;physical gold coin. You have to dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a&nbsp;gold coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and give yourself a&nbsp;couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks, simply add a&nbsp;couple trillion with a&nbsp;few computer keystrokes. (Fancy finan­cial people call this “Rehypoth­e­ca­tion,” “Fractional Reserve Banking,” or …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monkey-ball-part-1-banana-bunch-values/" data-type="post" data-id="645">we used Dolphin’s debugger to find the location of Player 1’s score in RAM</a>. In this article, our goal is to hack the score calculation routine so that the bonus goals do not award so many points.</p>



<p>Levels in Super Monkey Ball can have up to three separate exits: the normal Blue exit, a Green exit, and a Red exit. If you manage to get to a Green or Red exit, the game will let you skip a number of upcoming levels (e.g. skip the next 3 levels). In addition, it multiplies the score for completing the level by the number of levels skipped (e.g. you gain 3 times as many points as you would have with the normal exit). This is a totally bonkers amount of points, especially for levels which you can complete in only a few seconds and so also get the time bonus multiplier. In the below screenshot, the normal Blue exit would have awarded 3,386 points. Instead the game awards <em>130,158</em> points because I completed the level with the Red exit! There is some fun in a risk/reward calculation, but not when it’s this lopsided!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="188" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png 390w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px"></a></figure>



<p>It really incentivizes you to skip levels, which means you play less of the game, which… sucks. If we eliminate the level skip bonus entirely, then it becomes a more interesting trade-off. You can either skip a few levels and so be less likely to lose lives but lose out on score, or you can choose to risk completing those levels and gain all the points from those levels you would have skipped. It’s a much more interesting mechanic than always choosing the Red exit to get that massive score dump.</p>



<p>So let’s start by finding the code that alters your score upon level completion. As in part 1, we set a memory watch breakpoint on Player 1’s score, then complete the level. As the score tally displays, Dolphin breaks and we have our score routine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="635" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-768x477.png 768w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a couple interesting things to notice in this screenshot. First, you can see the current instruction is storing the updated score into our player’s struct, which is what we expected/hoped to find. Just before that is where it adds the new points into the existing score. You can see in <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are the new score value to be added and the player’s current score, respectively. So this really looks like the routine we wanted to find. Finally, notice the <code>LR</code> value, which is where we jumped from to get into this routine. Let’s head to that code and see what called this routine. More specifically, we want to know where the beginning of this routine is, since we’ve paused execution somewhere in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="102" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png 512w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure>



<p>That tells us where the score calculation routine actually begins. Let’s go see what happens there at the start of this function.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="469" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png 500w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure>



<p>Well that… sure is some PowerPC code. I can read assembly if I have to, but that looks like a real chore to try to understand. Notice the start of the routine is something like 500 bytes away from where the actual store happens. I don’t want to try to understand that much assembly.</p>



<p>Well luckily, just a few years ago the NSA (yes, that NSA) made their internal software reverse-engineering (SRE) tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a> public. Among many other things, it is capable of disassembling binaries into C source. I figured it probably was capable of handling PPC binaries (it is), but I wondered if anyone had specifically tried it with a GameCube binary. Turns out somebody had: I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hmapl.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/ghidra-a-potentially-useful-reverse-engineering-tool/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about using a Ghidra plugin for the GameCube’s PPC variant to decompile Harvest Moon. I also found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank">a Ghidra plugin specifically for loading GameCube binaries</a> dumped from ISOs. It’s pretty painless to install. Once that’s done, you can use Dolphin to dump the game’s executable to disk, to load into Ghidra. Extract the game’s system data using Dolphin, and it will dump some binaries into a directory.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png"><img loading="lazy" width="823" height="751" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png 823w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-768x701.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px"></a></figure>



<p>The one we’re interested in is main.dol, which is the game’s main executable. Loading that into Ghidra will prompt you to analyze the binary. On my machine, that only took about a minute to complete. Now I was ready to see if Ghidra could turn that PPC code into readable C code. So I jumped to the start of the score routine and…</p>

<p>It worked! Without any symbol names, the code is hard to read, but it’s legible enough. This was so exciting to see!! I’ve been wanting to hack this score code for at least a decade. And look at those if-statements! They’re comparing something against ‘<code>G</code>‘ and ‘<code>R</code>‘. Green and Red exits, perhaps? I couldn’t wait to figure out what this code was doing.</p>



<p>I’ve inserted the code in text format here, with some interesting lines highlighted for discussion below.</p>

        }
      }
    }

  else {
    *(int *)(DAT_802f1f18 + 0x7c) = *(int *)(DAT_802f1f18 + 0x7c) + param_2;
    if (999999999 &lt; *(int *)(iVar2 + 0x7c)) {
      *(undefined4 *)(iVar2 + 0x7c) = 999999999;
    }
  }
  return;

<p>Even just looking at the raw code, you can see some interesting stuff. At [1] is our current PC, that <code>stw</code> instruction which we broke on back at the start of the article. You can see it’s adding the value of <code>uVar4</code> into the player’s score location. Scrolling up to [2], you see where <code>uVar4</code> is calculated, as the product of <code>iVar3</code> and <code>iVar6</code>. I bet one of those is the base score, and the other is the bonus multiplier. Going further up to [3], you’ll see <code>iVar3</code> does indeed seem to be derived from some global value. I bet that global is the current time, and these calculations are converting the internal time representation into points and maybe doing some rounding on the result. Looking around for more interesting stuff, the lines marked with [4] look a lot like bit flags. From the code flow, I bet that’s used for deciding which parts of the score calculation to display on screen when tallying the score.</p>



<p>So with some of those guesses, I used Ghidra to rename some of the local variables to be more descriptive. Here’s what I ended up with for everything that goes into calculating <code>uVar4</code> (I trimmed all the later stuff).</p>



<pre><code>  iVar2 = DAT_802f1f18;
  iVar4 = DAT_801eec4c;
  if ((param_1 &lt; 4) &amp;&amp; (1 &lt; param_1)) {
<strong><span>    score_multiplier = (int)DAT_801f3a7a; //[4]</span></strong>
    iVar5 = *(int *)(*(int *)(DAT_802f1f30 + 0xc) + 0x40);
    time_score = (DAT_801f3a74 * 100) / 0x3c + (DAT_801f3a74 * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    time_score = time_score - (time_score &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    out_flags = 0;
    exit_data = iVar5;
    if (((DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 0) &amp;&amp; (exit_data = iVar5 + 0x14, DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 1)) &amp;&amp;
       (exit_data = iVar5 + 0x28, DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 2)) {
      exit_data = iVar5 + 0x3c;
    }
    if (*(char *)(exit_data + 0x12) == 'G') {
      out_flags = 4;
<strong><span> …</span></strong></code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><h3>Modern JavaScript developers just got a new headless CMS at their disposal—and it’s one we think they’ll have an absolute blast working with. Payload—a self-hosted Node, Express and React-based headless CMS, is now available.</h3></p></div><p>Hi—my name is James and I’m one of the founders of Payload CMS. After two years of development and thousands of commits, I am extremely excited to announce that Payload CMS is now available to the public. It’s our response to the surprisingly sparse JavaScript CMS market and we hope that its arrival improves the development workflow of engineers all over the world.</p><p>Payload has already been put through the test with an array of pilot projects that ranged from video game backend to full e-commerce store development, virtual event platform, and more. Through the projects we’ve released with Payload thus far, our own team’s efficiency has absolutely skyrocketed and we’re confident that it’s only going to get better from here.</p><h5>Now, we’re finally ready to open up to the community.</h5><p>We would greatly appreciate if you were to install Payload, give it a shot, and let us know what you think. Any type of feedback is welcome - be it about how we write our docs, about your experience using Payload in your projects, or anything else!</p><p id="we-needed-a-cms-that-didnt-exist"><h2>We needed a CMS that didn’t exist</h2></p><p>We built Payload because, over the years, my team and I have come to understand exactly what we need out of a CMS to build projects—big or small—for our clients:</p><p id="1-self-hosted"><h3>1. Self-hosted.</h3></p><p>What happens when your hosted CMS doesn’t offer you just that <em>one</em> thing that you need, so you need to end up opening a REST endpoint to build it? Guess it’s time to maintain your own server or Lambda function. Seems like a racket when you could have just used a self-hosted CMS in the first place and had a server set up already. We’ve been there too many times to let that keep happening.</p><p>Third-party hosted CMS might work for simple sites where you know you’ll be able to work within their confines for the lifetime of the app, or for strictly delivering content and not ever having to worry about receiving content, but when your needs become any more advanced, a self-hosted CMS that provides you with complete control is the way to go.</p><p>Security is also a concern with third-party hosted CMS solutions. <a href="https://trbl.design/">My digital design firm TRBL</a> works with many clients that are heavily security-focused and want to maintain complete control over their databases and infrastructure. Many of them deploy their CMS within their own private networks—only accessible via VPN or similar. For these clients, maintaining control over their own code is an absolute necessity, which removes many popular third-party hosted CMS from the equation.</p><p>Find out how to install Payload by <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation">heading to our Docs</a>.</p><p id="2-customizable-react-admin-panel"><h3>2. Customizable React admin panel.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS’ admin panel to be minimal, understandable, and most of all, <strong>completely customizable</strong>. If we need to customize a field type, we should be able to swap in our own React field component to take the place of a default text input, for example. We definitely don’t want to jump through any hoops, either, like dealing with messy iFrames or separately developed field type packages.</p><p>If we want to add a view, we should be able to build a React component and add it as a view. If we want to be able to customize the CMS’ branding, and completely white-label the CMS, we should be able to.</p><div><p><img src="https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png" alt="Payload headless CMS Admin UI built in React JS"></p><p>[Screenshot of the Payload Admin panel, editing a document from an Order collection]</p></div><p id="3-block-based-field-editor"><h3>3. Block-based field editor.</h3></p><p>My team and I design entire sites and apps with a component mentality—even down to how page layouts are assembled. Through UX design phases, we identify all the layout building “blocks” that are necessary to build and then we design our CMS to allow for content editors to self-craft their page layouts using the deliberately designed layout blocks that we’ve provided them with.  We then map each “block” in the CMS to React components that have props matching 1:1 to the fields within the CMS block. Boom, component-based layout building.</p><p>Like so many others, we started off years ago using WP and Advanced Custom Fields. ACF’s Flexible Content field type is great for layout building. But unfortunately, many other CMS have a complete lack of any layout-building workflow, and even when it’s supported, it lacks functionality or is a shoe-horned solution.</p><h5>Conditional Logic</h5><p>Another thing my team always took for granted in ACF that’s missing from other CMS completely is field-level conditional logic (show this field if another field has a value equal to <code>true</code> and similar). Our ideal CMS needs to have a built-in way to deliver dynamic interfaces that respond to input accordingly. Such a simple feature makes complex content management so much easier.</p><p id="4-javascript-top-to-bottom"><h3>4. JavaScript top to bottom.</h3></p><p>When’s the last time you worked on a web project without a <code>package.json</code>? Even if you work in PHP, you’re likely going to unavoidably need Node too. The idea of flattening our stack entirely into one language and not having to run a Docker container just to get a local LAMP environment going is a nice one indeed. We want to simplify our stack and keep it all JS. Better yet, TypeScript.</p><p id="5-reusable-secure-authentication"><h3>5. Reusable, secure authentication.</h3></p><p>One of the toughest parts about content management systems in-general is that they perform a lot of the lifting that a typical application framework would also need, but fall dramatically short of being able to call themselves an app framework through and through because of their lack of support for reusable authentication. For example, if you wanted to build a full SaaS product, you might need to create products, users, licenses, pages, and maybe even blog posts. Any run-of-the-mill CMS might get you close to being able to CRUD all of this stuff within its system, but what about user authentication? What about having control over users’ access? You’d be more often than not left to fend for yourself. Commonly you’d end up with either rolling your own system from scratch or building out a patchwork of separate systems (and separate admin UIs) to manage the product.</p><p>We need a CMS that comes with robust and reusable authentication right out of the box, so we can leverage the CMS for all our commonly needed authentication functionality. This way, we can keep all of our logic organized and build fully-featured apps right in our CMS that we’ve become accustomed to.</p><p>This way, if a client of ours comes to us asking for a simple app or a marketing site, but in the future, decides that they need to add full e-commerce support, we won’t end up with a messy disconnected set of admin UIs for them to manage their single product within. It can all be done in Payload.</p><h5>Payload's Authentication Operations</h5><p>In addition to just being able to log in and log out, Payload ships with everything a fully-featured app needs when it comes to authentication:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-registration</strong></li><li><strong>Login</strong></li><li><strong>Logout</strong></li><li><strong>Refresh token functionality</strong></li><li><strong>Forgot Password / Reset Password</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic locking of accounts on X number of failed password attempts</strong></li><li><strong>Email verification on new account creation</strong></li></ul><p>Payload supports as many authentication-ready collections as you need—meaning you could easily maintain a collection of Admins as well as a collection of Customers—each storing separate information and having separate access control to your documents.</p><h5>Payload's Access Control</h5><p>One of the best parts about Payload is its <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview">function-based Access Control</a>. Right in your configs, you define who can access what documents via extremely simple and straightforward Access Control functions.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example of an Orders collection with fine-tuned Access Control:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> Orders </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  access</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>create</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>          owner</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> equals</span><span>:</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>update</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>delete</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="6-uploads-with-local-storage"><h3>6. Uploads with local storage.</h3></p><p>Other existing CMS provide integrations to third-party file storage solutions, but those come with an additional cost, and one more third-party dependency to maintain. We want to be able to store our own file uploads, in our own contexts. If we want to ship them off to AWS S3 or similar after they’re uploaded locally—then so be it. They should be our files first though. And uploading should be simple to configure.</p><p id="7-code-based"><h3>7. Code-based.</h3></p><p>We used the ACF GUI for a while, but then realized we could be much more deliberate if we stored our ACF configs right in the PHP of our site. It was super nice to have written them, understood the code, and have them checked in directly to our repositories. Having our schemas so close to our code made referencing them significantly easier. Nowadays, we don’t find value from GUI schema designers and would rather just write them in code, pending the syntax is concise enough.</p><p id="8-maintain-your-own-express-server"><h3>8. Maintain your own Express server.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS with the right level of abstraction. That means giving us the functionality we know we won’t ever need to change, like auth and file upload, while also giving us the freedom to do what we need to do unhindered by a big lumbering framework whose docs are written for people that have Ph.Ds in Computer Science.  If we could keep our hands on our own Express server, then we could do whatever we need to do however we need to do it, outside of the CMS. Plus, if we could keep our own Express server, we could combine a CMS with a SSR framework like NextJS if we wanted to. One command, spin up Next and the CMS at once.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example for how Payload ties in to your existing Express server:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> payload </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'payload'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> express </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'express'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>payload</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  secret</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  mongoURL</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'mongodb://localhost/payload'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  express</span><span>:</span><span> app</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Application listening on </span><span>${</span><span>3000</span><span>}</span><span>...</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="9-localization-support"><h3>9.

Eventually, we may even become the go-to person on our team or in our organization, seen as the technical guru of our field.</p><p id="bd7c">At this level, we get a self-esteem boost, which is positive. But at times we may fall into the trap of getting an unnecessary ego. The wrong mindset creeps in, which can lead to the beginning of our downfall.</p><p id="8035">I’ve been through that journey. So I now consciously remind myself not to fall into one of those mindsets again. We’ll talk about three of them.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="fdb9">I once saw a tweet from a person who claimed his father (a programmer) offered to teach him how to code, and he rejected it. The author of the tweet is now a developer, describing himself as a self-taught programmer.</p><p id="e3c4">Programming isn’t a skill one can master completely by simply taking a course or getting a degree. A lot of sweat and time spent digging and learning is needed to build one’s competency.</p><p id="a45d">It’s not a field that can be effectively explored and fully discovered alone. We might not have a personal mentor and we may not have taken any formal courses, but that doesn’t change the fact that we still learn by reading from somewhere — whether that be a book, tutorial, blog, manual, or even Stack Overflow. All these things were written by someone.</p><p id="6607">In fact, the best way to learn programming is by working with a group of developers — through code reviews, pairings, constant discussion, and the exchange of ideas and the information learned. Attending conferences, guilds, dojos, etc. helps too.</p><p id="739c">Therefore, much of what we’ve learned and where we are today isn’t a result of our self-meditation on a mountain. Instead, it’s an accumulated assimilation of the knowledge and experience others have shared with us, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="cc5a">We should always be grateful.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="0edf">Someone responded to one of my past blogs saying, “The young ones can’t concentrate. And their productivity is vastly lower than that of us oldsters. Their code quality is way lower.” I felt disgusted by this blanket statement targeting young programmers, even if I’m not the young one.</p><p id="c651">We learn, we grow, we age. With the advantage of time, we sometimes gain an upper hand in terms of both knowledge and experience in some area.</p><p id="10db">However, software development is an ever-changing field. One needs to continue learning to keep abreast of a skill. Over time, some of the past knowledge we acquired and spent time on is no longer relevant. When you consider what’s still relevant, the knowledge gap between older and younger programmers becomes smaller.</p><p id="15b7">At times, some area of knowledge younger programmers have might surpass us, the older folks (I consider myself an <em>older folk</em>, having worked for more than two decades). In software development, there’s been so much new knowledge to harvest in the last 10 years, and it’s not possible for us to extract it all.</p><p id="0b17">Never look down on the young ones. Respect each other, and always shamelessly ask and listen to their opinion. Be open. Avoid impostor syndrome. We might be surprised to learn a lot from those younger than us.</p><p id="28f9">The young ones are the future. They’ll shape the world one day. Teach them as much as you can, and also learn from them as much as you can. We’re not always right.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e916">“What more is there to learn within programming? Everything new is just an old thing with a different look — or it’s just <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>for</code> loops covered by fancier names and structures externally.” I thought this back then after I’ve mastered C++ and object-oriented programming.</p><p id="0a2f">I despised Java as an inferior language to C++ and looked down on all scripts — VBScript, JavaScript, and let’s not forget HTML, which isn’t even a language to me. Python, what is it? No <code>{}</code> and, it’s optional to use <code>;</code>? Using indentation is a must??</p><p id="f535">The word<em> evolve </em>meant nothing to me, and after a decade, Python became the most used language.</p><p id="1213">I still have the utmost respect for those with competency in C programming, having the ability to work with pointers, having proper memory management, and writing code that compiles into the smallest and most efficient executable.</p><p id="e21a">However, that’s no longer what mainstream software development looks like. Web programming took the world by storm in the ‘90s and early 2000s. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile development has become a significant player in software development. And now artificial intelligence could be the next wave, which the Python language plays a significant role in enabling.</p><p id="11c4">Fast forward to today: Now I’m getting my feet wet in mobile development, a rapidly changing field. I just realized how wrong I was back then in despising the newer yet seemingly inferior product (i.e., Java) over what I’d mastered (i.e., C++). Java has influenced many of the programming languages we have today, and its JVM is the backbone of many new languages (e.g., Scala and Kotlin).</p><p id="97ef">Never despise newer tech at a glance. It’s true most of them spawn from an existing tech and may look similar (or at times even inferior), but all of these small little changes could contribute to the next leap of change.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7126">In the early years of my career, I worked hard and was promoted fast. My boss jokingly gave me a little advice, “Don’t get cocky.” I guess that about sums it all up.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>In this article, we set up <em>limiters</em> in order to equitably distribute the bandwidth of our Internet connection among all the users of our local network.</p>



<h2>What are <em>Limiters</em>?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a purpose.<br>A limiter can be used to limit traffic to a specific IP address or subnet, to limit traffic for a specific type of service (e.g. e-mail, web, …) or to distribute traffic equitably among several users.</p>



<p>Typical uses of limiters are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>limit the Internet bandwidth of user X to 1 Mbps ;</li><li>distribute equitably 10 Mbps of bandwidth between all the users of the “LAN” network;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the “OPT” network to a total of 5 Mbps;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the FTP protocol to 2 Mbps.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a usage</strong>.<br>At the opposite, traffic shaping (like CBQ) allows to guarantee a minimum bandwidth.</p>



<h2>How limiters work?</h2>



<p>The implementation of the limiters is done in 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>creating <strong>limiter</strong> itself: it’s a pipe with a maximum bandwidth which operates globally or by group of IP addresses;</li><li>creating assignment <strong>rules</strong>: which traffic will be limited by which pipe.</li></ul>



<p>Limiters are usually created in pairs: one limiter for incoming traffic (Download) and one limiter for outgoing traffic (Upload).</p>



<p>Limiters are organized hierarchically: a root limiter (also called a pipe), with a bandwidth and a latency, and on the other hand child limiters (called queues) with a weight (i.e. a priority).</p>



<h2>Use case: distribute Internet bandwidth equitably</h2>



<p>In this article we work with the following case study: we have an Internet connection with a download speed of 200 Mbps and an upload speed of 50 Mbps.<br>We want to share dynamically this bandwidth between all users.</p>



<p>If we have 2 users connected at the same time, they will each have 100 Mbps for download and 25 Mbps for upload at the maximum.<br>If we have 10 users connected at the same time, they will each have 20 Mbps for download and 5 Mbps for upload at the maximum.</p>



<p>pfSense will manage this equitable distribution automatically and dynamically as we go.</p>



<p>The network diagram is as follows:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="718" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png 501w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"><figcaption>Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start the configuration!</p>



<h2>1. Create the upload <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We create 2 root limiters: one for upload and one for download.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="156" height="238" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-traffic-shaper-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the <strong>Limiters</strong> tab, click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the pipe and its queues.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the pipe (alphanumeric characters and underscore only). In our case, we call it “<strong>Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: the bandwidth of the pipe. Note that we can define a bandwidth according to a schedule (“Schedule” option). In our case, we choose “50 Mbps”.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: this parameter allows to define how the limitation will be applied to the traffic. 3 choices are available:<ul><li><span>none</span>: the limitation will apply to all traffic as a single set. In our case, this is what we choose (we want the whole outgoing traffic to be limited to 50 Mbps).</li><li><span>Source addresses</span>: the limitation will apply per source IP address (or group of source IP addresses, depending on the mask). So, to perform a limitation by IP address of a network, we choose “Source addresses” and specify a /32 mask. This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Upload pipe.</li><li><span>Destination addresses</span>: the limitation will apply by destination IP address (or group of destination IP addresses, depending on the mask). This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Download pipe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: allows to set advanced parameters such as latency or packet loss rate. These parameters are useful to simulate bad Internet connections (or to make a bad joke to a colleague…). We won’t use it in our case, but the name of each field speaks for itself.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="963" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x295.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x755.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point we have a pipe that will allow us to limit our traffic to a maximum bandwidth of 50 Mbps.</p>



<p>The next step is to create a queue linked to this pipe and specify that this queue will be applicable per user.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the page of the limiter we just created, we click on the “+ Add new Queue” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the queue.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the queue. In our case, we call it “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: the mask to be applied. In our case, we choose “Source addresses”. We want to apply this limitation for each user, i.e. per source IP address, so we choose “32” as mask size.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: weight ranging from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority). For a fair distribution of the bandwidth of the root limiter, this field can be left empty. If we want to give more bandwidth to some users than to others, then we have to play with this value. In our case, we leave the field empty (the distribution will be fair between users).</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: we leave these fields empty.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="802" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x246.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our limiters (pipe and queue) are ready for outgoing (upload) traffic.</p>



<p>We still have to do the same configuration for incoming (download) traffic.</p>



<h2>2. Create the download <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The pipe configuration is the same as for the upload pipe.<br>You just have to think about choosing the right bandwidth (in our case, 200 Mbps) and changing its name (in our case, we call it “Download”).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="910" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 977w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x279.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for the upload pipe, we create a queue: click on the button “+ Add new Queue”.</p>



<p>The configuration is almost the same as for the upload queue.<br>The difference is in the choice for the “Mask” option. Choose “Destination addresses”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="798" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x245.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The limiters are created:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="123" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiters-list-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Limiters tree</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>3. Modify firewall rules</h2>



<p>The last step is to configure the firewall to associate traffic with limiters.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Rules:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="241" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Choose the LAN tab and edit each filtering rule for Internet access.</p>



<p>On each rule, go to the advanced options (“Display Advanced” button):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="244" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png 405w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Advanced Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the bottom of the page, for the “In / Out pipe” option, choose “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>” for the first drop-down list and “<strong>LAN_Download</strong>” for the second:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="126" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png 791w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-300x48.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-768x122.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"><figcaption>[pfSense] In / Out pipe (limiters)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to perform this manipulation on all the rules concerned.</p>



<p>The traffic limitation per user is in place!</p>



<h2>4. Check the service</h2>



<p>To check that the limiters are working properly, navigate to Diagnostics &gt; Limiter Info.<br>Each pipe and its queues is presented in text format with its parameters and values.</p>

            <p>The if-statement is a very basic thing, not just in bash, but in all of programming.
I see them used quite a lot in shell scripts,
even though in many cases they can be replaced with something much more elegant.</p>
<p>In this rather short article, I'll show how control operators can be used
instead.
Many probably know about this, but don't realize how to use them nicely.
This will help you write cleaner shell scripts in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple if-statements looks like in bash:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]
</span><span>then
    </span><span>command
</span><span>fi

</span><span># or
</span><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]; then </span><span>command</span><span>; fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ughh. Let's improve!</p>
<h2 id="control-operators">Control operators
    <a href="#control-operators" aria-label="Anchor link for: control-operators">

    </a>

</h2>
<p>Bash provides <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Definitions.html#Definitions">control operators</a> to build sequences of
commands.
Some of these are conditional and allow logical branching based on the success
state of the last run command.</p>
<p>We will just focus on these two logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>: the AND operator, run the following command only if previous succeeded</li>
<li><code>||</code>: the OR operator, run the following command only if previous failed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exit-codes">Exit codes
    <a href="#exit-codes" aria-label="Anchor link for: exit-codes">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>You might wonder how bash considers whether a command succeeded.
This is where <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status">exit codes</a> come in.
When a program exits a numeric status code is returned.
A value of <code>0</code> means the program succeeded, any other value means it failed.</p>
<p>The exit code is normally hidden.
The status of the last run command is stored in the <code>?</code> variable.
You may inspect it by invoking:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>?
</span></code></pre>
<p>E.g., listing with <code>ls</code> normally returns <code>0</code>, but this value differs if the
directory doesn't exist or if an error occurred.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>ls ~</span><span>/            </span><span># exit code: 0
</span><span>ls </span><span>~</span><span>/nonexistent </span><span># exit code: 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will function similarly to almost any program.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-commands">Chaining commands
    <a href="#chaining-commands" aria-label="Anchor link for: chaining-commands">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Let's go over some examples to show how these control operators can be used.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Source_command">source</a> the <code>~/.profile</code> file, but only if it
is readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>]</span><span>; then
    </span><span>source </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span><span>fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using control operators:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>. </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only if the readability check expression is truthful/succeeds, we want to source
the file, so we use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>To require invoking user to be root, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command exists with <code>0</code>, so this propagates to <code>exit</code> if the
first expression is truthful.</p>

<p>If we'd like to print our profile file contents with a success message,
or an error message on reading failure, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cat ~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> This is your profile </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Failed to read profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can make these command sequences as long as you want. Useful for
building install scripts that go through a series of steps. You could define
bash functions for each step and orchestrate the installation like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>cleanup </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or format it differently to make long sequences better readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>cleanup </span><span>||
  </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre><h2 id="nice-to-know">Nice to know
    <a href="#nice-to-know" aria-label="Anchor link for: nice-to-know">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159514/61092">many</a> more control operators,
including list terminators, pipe operators, and others.</p>
<p>The <code>[</code> (commonly used in if-statements) isn't just a shell feature.
It is a binary on Unix-like systems, usually located at <code>/usr/bin/[</code>,
so it can be used anywhere.
It returns the exit code <code>0</code> if the expression was truthful.</p>
<p>You can chain multiple <code>[ expr ] &amp;&amp; [ expr ]</code> expressions together, they are
commands after all.</p>
<p>Bash also has <code>[[</code>, which is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13542832/1000145">different</a> from <code>[</code>.</p>
<p>You can wrap multiple commands with <code>{ expr }</code> to run it as single expression in
your command chain. For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>{ </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root</span><span>; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1 }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands do nothing more than returning <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Bash features <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">parameter expression</a>.
You can use <code>${EDITOR:=nvim}</code> to set the <code>EDITOR</code> variable to <code>nvim</code> only if
it is empty, so you won't even need conditionals.</p>
<p>Most other shells support similar operators. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> uses <code>; and</code> and <code>; or</code>, but now <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4620">supports</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> as well in modern versions.</p>
<p><code>$_</code> (or <code>Alt+.</code>) is your last used argument (noted by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lobste.rs/s/nao13f/elegant_bash_conditionals#c_brp038">@Diti</a>).
For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>test</span><span> -f </span><span>"</span><span>FILE</span><span>" </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>source </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span>" </span><span>|| </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span> does not exist</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span>2
</span></code></pre>
<p>A function or script returns the exit code of the last expression. If your last
expression is a command chain as described in this article, you might have an
unexpected exit code. See

comments.</p>

</h2>
<p>These command sequences with control operators are an elegant alternative for
simple if-statements. I think they look much better and are more expressive
looking at conditional logic.</p>
<p>But, don't overuse them. For bigger statements or advanced branching, you should
fall back to if-statements.</p>
<p>I hope this article motivates you to make your shell scripts a little more
elegant in the future by using these operators.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2019-07-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2019-09-19</span>.</p>
<p>Frontend developers are pushing JavaScript as though the web could not function without it. The fact is that JavaScript is one of the top reasons for security breaches on the client computer and client mobile phones, it is a plague that turns privacy into a public exhibition, and it has paralyzed the industry in such a way that you can hardly find a website that doesn't display "the white screen of death" if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it straight out: Frontend developers are breaking the Internet! They have been stricken with some kind of mass psychosis in which even the least amount of independent thinking has become so hard that you think you're dealing with a zombie. It doesn't even qualify as a form of blind following, because nobody is leading. It rather looks like everyone is running around frenzied.</p>
<p>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</p>
<p>I have worked as both backend and frontend developer since 1998 and I have never once made a web application depend upon JavaScript. This goes for web shops, blog systems, large CMS installations, as well as Intranet administration utilities, and much more. In situations where I have been hired as a consultant to an existing team, the first thing I have done was to remove any dependency on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Not once has a client ever experienced a problem with his web application as a result, rather on the contrary. Removing JavaScript makes the application load much faster, removes multiple security related attack vectors, and greatly improves customer privacy concerns and usability.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can simulate much of the improved UI experience that JavaScript can provide using only backend technology. The much improved performance, security, and privacy far exceed whatever loss of JavaScript capabilities you might experience.</p>
<p>The problem resides with websites that by nature doesn't require any form of JavaScript in order to serve the content they are serving. And the fact of the matter is that the majority of frontend developers aren't developing applications for niche markets with specific JavaScript requirements, rather they are developing regular websites, applications that in the end are just plain simple HTML. You do remember what plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is right?</p>
<p>Even most niche products that in nature perhaps do require some amount of JavaScript could often still be somewhat useful had they at least been build <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opt_in">opt-in</a> rather than not function at all.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever seen how a blind person uses the Internet? If not you need to have this demonstrated! Especially if you're a frontend developer. You might think that blind people who use the Internet are a minority, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter how many people with disabilities use the Internet, the Internet is for everybody, and when websites are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Currently most websites are developed without the least concern for accessibility which makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use and the way JavaScript is being used is a very big part of that problem.</p>
<p>Websites that create barriers for people with disabilities are generally just badly designed. Making websites accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. And you, as a frontend developer, must understand that it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your web application contains as few barriers as possible. If you don't do that, then why are you doing frontend development in the first place?</p>
<p>Web development is not about how to make the work fast and easy for the "lazy" frontend developer who long since has forgotten how to manually do anything and as a result no longer knows or understands how to put a simple website together without the use of a barrier producing framework or technology.</p>
<p>The optimal solution will always be to make sure that basic functionality works without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that more and more people disable JavaScript uncompromisingly, using extensions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a>, due to very valid security concerns. If a website isn't working without JavaScript it is loosing potential visitors and customers on a regular basis. If you only use a JavaScript based statistics system, such as Googles Analytics, then you won't even see the problem. You need to look into the statistics running on the backend such as the webserver logs to see how many visitors that visit your website without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>Security issues from third party JavaScript widgets and JavaScript libraries are vulnerable aspects of JavaScript that is actively exploited on a massive scale. Security issues in browsers, such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/#CVE-2019-11707">CVE-2019-11707</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-19/">CVE-2019-11708</a>, are highly critical issues that are completely mitigated if JavaScript is disabled or removed completely. CVE-2019-11707 is a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that can result in an exploitable crash due to issues in Array.pop which can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects. CVE-2019-11708 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">in arbitrary code execution</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the client is not a necessary evil. It is a tool that with great and meticulous care can improve the user experience to a certain degree in some unique situations, but if you are making your regular and non-unique web application depend upon JavaScript, then that is a clear sign that you are doing something very wrong.</p>
<p>Stop pushing JavaScript as a dependency just to make a regular and stupid website run!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-name="content">
<p><time>March 1, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: People are unlikely to make swift changes to their core behaviors. By
detecting what they care about now, you will get an accurate estimation of
their near future behavior. That helps you answer the second question you need
to ask during an interview: «Can I work with you?»</p>

<p>The previous behaviors will likely continue to manifest themselves. That is one
of the natural qualities of us humans. Like Newtonian objects, we stay in
motion when we are in motion and lay at rest when we are already at rest. To
change that, we have to exert a massive force and consciously apply it. If we
do it for a long enough time, new behaviors set in and become habits. But
without that effort, we usually continue being who we are. Perfectionists will
continue chasing the ideal state and delaying project deliveries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cowboys</a>
will continue YOLOing untested solutions to production. In other words, the
matters people care about now are likely to govern their future behaviors.</p>

<p>That quality is both a challenge and a trait, depending on how you look at it.
If you want to change those behaviors in yourself, that is a challenge. If you
need to understand how a person would behave in a given context, that is a
valuable trait. And you can and should use this trait as a tool to learn more
about your candidates.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://autoiterative.com/blog/posts/what-to-ask-when-interviewing/">previous post</a>, we introduced a framework for hiring software
engineers.  It consists of three questions that you need to get sincere answers
to:
</p><ol>
<li>Can the candidate do the work?</li>
<li>Can I work with you?</li>
<li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to answer the first question is to let them do some actual work.
To answer the second one, assess their current behaviors and map them to your
company culture. This post explains in detail how to perform such an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-work-with-you">Can I work with you?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, all you need to do is compare a candidate behavior to
your company culture.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate what we mean with a concrete case. At AutoIterative, we have
already pulled all the hard work of defining what our culture is. For example,
one of our core values at AutoIterative is «to do science instead of
cargo-culting.» That means that we always want to understand why we do
what we do. Whether ideas are ours or not, we are comfortable questioning and
challenging them. So how do we determine where the candidate stands in that
regard? Could we ask straight whether they are confident with challenging their
ideas? Sure, but that will not give us a rigorous assessment. Chances are, the
answer would be: «yes, of course, I am!» We do not want to measure
wishful thinking or imagination. The better question would be to ask a
candidate about the last time they had their ideas challenged. From their
answers, we can derive a more reliable estimation of their behavior.</p>

<p>Let us show how a typical conversation could unroll (along with our notes
explaining why do we ask what we ask):</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Tell me about a recent
case when someone challenged an idea that you introduced?

<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Once, I pushed for the idea
of adding monitoring to our service. It was roughly a year ago, and I got a lot
of pushback from my team.

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer hints that the candidate cares about monitoring and metrics.
It is also helpful for analysis: it tells us how long ago that happened, it is
relevant, and it presents a situation. It is worth investigating in-depth, so
we decide to continue exploring it.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, what
happened? What was the pushback?
<span>(Note that we are using an open-ended
question here. We do not want our biases to influence their answers.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Well, we were having issues
in production at that moment. We were spending a lot of time reading logs,
trying to understand what was happening. Also, we were under pressure to
deliver a new feature. That could be the reason why people were not really
receptive to my idea when I proposed it. One of the engineers said that we have
no time for it now.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer sheds even more light on the situation. First, it reveals
that the team was under pressure (a data point on how the candidate might
perform in such circumstances). Second, it shows that the candidate wanted to
improve the situation by investing in observability (this is great for us!). It
also tells us there was a conflict (a data point on how the candidate might
defuse them). Now we should dig into those individual aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Why did you want to add
metrics?
<span>(asking <i>why</i> will force the candidate
to explain their reasoning. That defines the task they had to do at the
moment.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Because reading logs is not
the same as having metrics that you can query. Some visibility would have
improved the situation. I just wanted to understand the problem, fix it and
prevent us from getting into it in the future. We had to start somewhere, and
having those metrics would have provided a lot of value.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This candidate demonstrates that they care about the runtime (a valuable
trait for us!). They opt to invest a bit today for a better future (again,
aligned with our values). If they care about those things in our company, we
would be happy to work with them. Now, let us dig into the conflict bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, and how did
you handle the situation of your coworker saying a flat-out «no» to
your idea?
<span>(Note that here we exaggerate a bit what the
candidate said. Will they correct our impression? Will they confirm it and
elaborate more on how they saw the situation?)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I did not reply at the
exact time they said no. I did not want to provoke a conflict in front of
everyone during a standup meeting. It was not the first time I got a pushback
either. But we were all suffering, and I thought it was critical to add metrics
to our system to help us out of the situation. So after the meeting, I
approached my manager and explained the value we will get if we have metrics. I
asked for help pushing this forward.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: yes, this was an open conflict, and we need to drive the questions to
the resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: And what happened? How
did you present the idea to your manager?
<span>(Note the open-ended question again. It
pushes the candidate to explain <i>how</i> they behaved, allowing us to derive
the <i>why</i> behind that.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I explained that we were
drowning in operational work and that we were blind. I learned in the SRE book
that measuring requests and latencies is one of the first steps to do.  <span>(Note: this could be cargo-culting. Let us make a
note, so we can later dig into their reasoning.)</span> I thought it made sense
to try it. I told my manager that I was ready to take ownership of the whole
process. Initially, I just wanted to add a couple of metrics as a proof of
concept and see if that improved our situation.  If it did, we would spend less
time debugging and more time working on features. He liked the idea, and we
started working on a plan to communicate to our team that I would start working
on it.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: From their answers, we already have a clear definition of the action
that the candidate took. But there are more data points about the candidate.
They think about the team’s success (time spent working on a product instead of
debugging). They built a proof-of-concept to validate the idea before proposing
a full solution. They approached the manager asking for help instead of openly
arguing back. This behavior could hint at them being context-aware and a
team-player. They understood that the whole team is under stress caused by the
pressure to deliver.</p>

<p>The natural next step would be to push for closure and ask how the situation
ended. If you need more context, you can continue asking open-ended questions.
You will discover more details and get a more refined picture of a candidate’s
behavior. You can ask what the candidate learned from the situation and what
conclusions they drew from it. But let us wrap up the example here.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>

<p>As many of you probably realized, this is an interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA">SOARA</a>
techniques. The question explicitly asks for a story from the past, not for an
imaginary scenario. How a candidate replies to such an interview will yield a
lot of information and map to a behavior. Their answer will tell a story, and
their narrative will highlight what they value. From that, we would see what
their natural tendencies will be. And if you did your introspection and know
what your behaviors are, then comparing those two will answer whether you can
work together.</p>

<p>Note, however, that those techniques are not a silver bullet either. They will
not give you a 100% precise picture of a candidate out of a limited interview
time. No method will do that for you. But when applied correctly, they raise
your accuracy way above just the feelings. Focus on understanding and
thoroughly defining your culture. That will give you the exact dimensions along
which to measure your candidates. That, in turn, will provide a set of values
to assess. From them, you get an understanding of which questions are efficient
for you and which are not. Practice using the best ones, and you will answer
the second question with ease and precision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the AutoIterative platform will assess the candidate’s ability to do
the work.</p>

December 13, 1996. Revised November 11, 1997.
</center>
<center>
<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>
This paper describes a possible Internet service that
some major organization such as
Harvard University, AT&amp;T,
the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers,
the American Mathematical Society, the American Medical Association,
or even the Vatican, might offer: a home page "in perpetuity".
Such a "perpetual page" or "eternity page" or
"e-memorial page" would be a home page that the organization would
help the customer set up, with a guarantee that it would
last for (say) 500 years, or until the organization no
longer exists.
It would list all the things that the customer would like to
be remembered for (accomplishments, family, etc.).
As the population of the U.S. ages,
such a service should prove very popular.
After all, almost everyone wants to be remembered by posterity.
</p><center><h2> Details </h2></center>
<ul>
<li>
The name for this service needs to be chosen with care, and
of course registered. "Eternity service",
"Perpetual page", "Eternity page", "E-memorial page",
"Everlasting page"
are a few possibilities. I will use "Perpetual page"
in this paper.

</li>
<li>
The first version of this paper was written in
December 1996, although the idea for the "Perpetual home page"
first occurred to me in January 1996.
Not surprisingly,
it turns out that other people have had similar ideas, and there may be some
commercial services that provide electronic gravestones available even now.
But my vision is that
this service would be offered by a major organization or institute,
that has already existed for a long time and
has some chance of existing 500 years from now.
And I'm not thinking of tombstones, but home-pages.

</li>
<li>
The "Perpetual page" could include such things as:
<ul>
<li>
photographs of houses, boats, paintings, other precious possessions
</li>
<li>
lists of awards, accomplishments
</li>
<li>
writings, drawings, songs, even unpublished novels
(disk space is cheap)
</li>
<li>
links to perpetual pages of one's family (including ancestors!) and friends
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's chance to write their own
<em>New York Times</em> obituary page, or "time capsule".
(Many people do not realize that except for a handful of major obituaries,
every obituary item in the <em>New York Times</em> has to be
purchased at about $40 per line -- this can be a humiliating
experience for the next-of-kin.
Setting up a "Perpetual page" in advance for the sick
and elderly could be both therapeutic and comforting for the family.)

</li>
<li>
There should be a generous amount of disk
space available for each page - a minimum of ten megabytes,
to allow a number of photographs to be included. (Most Internet
providers at present do not allow nearly enough disk space.)
As my colleague 
Andrew Odlyzko has pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~amo/doc/tragic.loss.txt">
discussion of the future of scholarly journals</a>,
the cost of disk space is dropping so rapidly that it is likely that 
the cost of providing a service
in perpetuity will be not much more than that of providing it for
one year.

</li>
<li>
The organization would help the customer set up the initial page, and would
provide instructions on how to maintain it.
A "help desk" would be part of the service.

</li>
<li>
One way to structure the offer might be to tell customers:
For a one-time fee of $X, we will provide you with Y MB of
storage, and as long as you pay a small monthly fee,
you can keep modifying it.  Once you stop paying the monthly fee
(say because you die, or switch to a different
provider) we will keep the latest version <em>forever</em>.

</li>
<li>
Part of the offer would be a guarantee that when the Internet is replaced
by some other service in a few years, all the "Perpetual pages"
would be automatically converted to the new medium.

</li>
<li>
It is important that the organization offering the servce
should have been in existence for a long time, and have a good chance of
still existing 500 hundred years from now.
The organizations mentioned in the Abstract certainly
satisfy these conditions, and it is easy to think of others. 
Such a service would not carry much conviction
if offered by some tiny local Internet service provider.

</li>
<li>
This is the first time in history that such a thing is possible.

</li>
<li>
Incidentally,
the <em>New York Times</em>} for Saturday Dec. 7 1996 describes (on page D2)
a patent, US 5,517,791, for a new tombstone design that can
incorporate a person's life story - including photographs.
So ideas like the one I am proposing are "in the air".

</li>
<li>
As one may verify by visiting cemeteries in New Jersey, tombstones are rarely
legible after a hundred years have passed.  One of the advertisements for the
proposed service could show a family searching through a
cemetery full of grave stones that have been worn smooth,
looking for the lost grave of an ancestor.  Furthermore,
as the world population continues to explode,
cemeteries will become increasingly irrelevant.

</li>
<li>
The "perpetual page" service would especially appeal to mature customers.
There are several ways in which advertisements could point out the futility
of earlier attempts to be remembered, even by world leaders.
For example, one advertisement could show a replica of the original
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
after which all later mausoleums are named.
(See <em>The Oxford History of the Classical World</em>,
ed. J. Boardman et al., Oxford, 1993, p. 150.)
<center> <img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/maus1.jpg"> </center>
<p>
One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was
built in the year 353 for King Mausolus of Caria by his wife.
It no longer exists.
"But if King Mausolus had had a perpetual page, we could still read
about his victories today ...".

</p></li>
<li>
An alternative way in which the "perpetual page" could be used is
by family and friends after the death of a loved one, by setting up a
permanent memorial for the deceased.  The Page would need to have an
authorized keeper, to screen out inappropriate material.
A certain amount of permanent space would be purchased, to which
interested parties could contribute in any way they wished.


</li>
<li>
Another advertisement could have a voice reading P. B. Shelley's
poem <strong>Ozymandias</strong>,
while the picture shows dust blowing around an appropriate ruin:

<pre>     I met a traveller from an antique land 
     Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
     Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
     Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
     Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
     The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
     And on the pedestal these words appear: 
     `My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' 
     Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
     Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
     The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</pre>
<center><img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/ozy4.jpg"> </center>
</li>
<li>
It will also give all the unpublished poets and writers,
the unrecognized painters and musicians, the scientists
whose theories are rejected, the opportunity to have their
work immortalized.

</li>
<li>
Yet another advertisement could have Jessye Norman singing the moving
and unforgettable aria "Remember Me"
from Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas".
(The formal title
is "Thy hand Belinda - when I am laid in Earth"
[Philips CD 434 161-2].)

</ul>

              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

		<p>Yet another PDP-1 riddle, extended mode.</p>

		<p><span>Y</span>esterday, we solved the mystery of <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2021/train-spotting-1">two well-known images</a>, formerly known as “The PDP-1 at the Tech Model Railroad Club”, with the help of the Hacker News community. — A triumph of shared knowledge.</p>
		<p>In 1971, the German artist Daniel Chodowiecki (1726 – 1801) commented his etching “Enlightenment” <em lang="de">(Aufklärung)</em> by the words, “However, if the sun only rises, mists do no harm.” <em lang="de">(Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.)</em> In real life, mists rise only to reveal another bank of fog. Which is the very process of research. — And this is certainly no exception. So this is a post about annother bank of fog, in the amazing form factor of a fully transitorized electronic contraption apt to manipulate 18-bit words in realtime according to a stored program and human interaction.</p>

Es wird auch wohl noch lange das schicklichste bleiben, wegen der Nebel, die immer aus Sümpfen, Rauchfässern und von neuen Brandopfern und Götzenaltären aufsteigen werden, die sie leicht verdecken können. Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.”</p>

		<h2>Another PDP-1B Prototype?</h2>
		<p><span>Y</span>esterday’s sunrise, <em>um,</em> success was the indentification of the scene of a series of images showing a somewhat rudimentary front part of a DEC PDP-1 and a Type 30 Visual CRT display next to a model railway layout. And we proceeded to conclude that this was a PDP-1 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, operated by the Program Head of the CS program, J.A.N. Lee (probably around 1970).</p>

		</figure>

		<p>However, this also posed a new riddle, as at least two sources referred to this machine as a PDP-1B. Namely, the history page of the UMass Amherst CS program’ website,</p>
		<blockquote>
		The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system.

		</blockquote>
		<p>and the title of another photo of the same series (or lot) in the collection of the Computer History Museum (CHM), which isn’t available as a digitized image,</p>

		</blockquote>

		<p>Following established knowledge, there was a single PDP-1A prototype, followed by two PDP-1B pre-production prototypes (one going to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, the other to BBN) and the production models PDP-1C and PDP-1D, the latter being the enhanced time-sharing model. Further, the two pre-production prototypes had a 4-cabinets main unit, which was repackaged for a more cost effective and reliable 3-cabinets design, and finally to a 4-cabinets design allowing for dedicated space for expansion modules for the production models. This history leaves no apparent room for a PDP-1B at Amherst. So is this an error in these attributions, maybe referring to a common source as a single point of failure, or is there more to this?</p>
		<p>Update: Gordon Bell et al. mention a third PDP-1 prototype in <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/_Books/Bell-ComputerEngineering.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="PDF">Computer Engineering. A DEC View of Hardware System Design</a> (Digital Press, Maynard, MA, 1978): <em>“A third machine, similar to the 1/A and 1/B, was constructed for internal use.”</em> (pp. 136, 137)<br>— An internal reference machine was much to be expected. Especially, since the PDP-1A prototype was borrowed to BBN (see below).</p>

		<h2>PDP-1 Lineage</h2>
		<h3>All-White PDP-1s</h3>
		<p>The first prototype, PDP-1A, was an all white machine, featuring an integrated control desk with built-in CRT and operator’s console, a three-cabinet packaging of the main unit, and a Friden Flexowriter as a console typewriter. This machine was presented at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.</p>

		</figure>

		<p>The same machine (and the same image) also appeared in the initial announcement in Datamation, November/December issue 1959:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Then, there is a white 4-cabinets machine seen in early DEC materials, here from a brochure from March 1961. This all-white machine features a 4-cabinets main unit, a detached control console with black print and the early DEC logo (more on this later), a CRT display in similar hexagonal housing as later Type 30 CRTs, but mounted on a narrower, single-unit stand, and a Soroban console typewriter (a modified IBM Model A):</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Apparently, we see this machine again at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in an image in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> by David Walden and Raymond Nickerson (ed.), 2010; page 51:</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The following, rather blurry image from <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/08/102740407-05-01-acc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Digital Equipment Corporation – Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present”</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, MA, 1972; p.3) seems to show the same machine (all white, 4 cabinets, detached console), but with a different CRT with the standard double-unit display stand. Notably, the paper-tape devices on the left and the chairs look much like the one the BBN image, hinting at the photo showing the same installation.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>The same configuration appears in yet another photo (from the “DIGITAL Computing Timeline”), here, explicitely tagged as <em>“The PDP-1 operating system, the world's first timesharing system, is written by engineers at MIT and BBN for the PDP-1. (…) Shown here is the PDP-1 installation at BBN.”:</em></p>

		</figure>

		<p>At this point it may be fair to assume that the images of the white PDP-1B, found in early DEC brochures, are actually depicting the BBN PDP-1B.</p>

		<p>The last image (to my humble knowledge) in this lineage of all-white PDP-1s featuring a detached console seems to be an early production PDP-1 in 3-cabinets packaging at Itek (allegedly the second production machine):</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>Something, all these all-white machines with a detached console have in common, is that they are lacking an integrated paper-tape unit. In these images, we see a separate generic paper-tape unit associated to the machine, usually to the left of the control console. DEC even envisioned the tape unit as a detached desk appliance, much like the control console:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Here’s a short history of this strand of PDP-1s, as comprehensively told in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> (ibidem, pp. 53–55):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Eastern Joint Computer Conference was in Boston in December 1959, and there Fredkin saw the PDP-1 and “realized it was fantastic.”
		The project to design and build the PDP-1 had started just four months prior to that. Ben Gurley was the designer, and he also built the computer with the help of one engineering assistant.</p>
		<p>“So,” says Fredkin, “I convinced BBN to become Digital’s first customer for the PDP-1. We arranged to borrow the prototype PDP-1 while Digital built the first ‘production’ version.” The prototype machine (a PDP model 1a) was delivered to BBN in early 1960.
		At the time, according to Fredkin, Digital had the idea that a computer manufacturer shouldn’t do software. Thus, Fredkin wrote the assembler for the machine, wrote utility routines (like a rudimentary operating system), and so forth. In that era programs were typically written on ruled sheets with columns for the various fixed-length instruction fields. Ed’s assembler for the PDP-1 was called FRAP, which stood for “free of rules assembly program” and which allowed variable-length instructions. At some point Fredkin also wrote light pen software for the machine.</p>
		<p>Eventually the first production model PDP-1, a PDP model 1b system (serial number 2), arrived at BBN. That was Digital’s first PDP-1 sale. Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>When the PDP-1b arrived, BBN had a ceremony with a lot of hoopla. I wrote a little program so that the PDP-1b could cut its own ribbon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony (appropriate since one of the ideas was for the PDP-1 to interact with the real world). Digital founder Ken Olsen was present.</p>
		<p>Bill Fletcher also was working with Fredkin on the PDP-1b. (…)</p>
		<p><strong>PDP-1b Time-Sharing: the Research Computer System</strong></p>
		<p>Fredkin says that he had the idea of hiring John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. This soon led to plans to develop a time-sharing system for the PDP-1. McCarthy had the idea of time-sharing, and Fredkin saw the potential for time-sharing on the PDP-1. (…) Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>John’s invention of time-sharing and his telling me about his ideas all occurred before the PDP-1 existed. When I first saw the PDP-1 at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, I realized that it was …</p></blockquote></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

    <div>
      
      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<![CDATA[How to Read Assembly Language]]>

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi

        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();

some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function

smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

            <!-- What are the features of lit -->
            <h2>Features of this tool</h2><p>
            Literate works with any programming language, generates HTML as output (<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">which can be converted to pdf</a>),
            and generates readable code. The code that is generated is indented properly and is automatically commented using the titles you have written
            for the code blocks.</p><p>
            Here is the full list of features:</p><ul>
                <li>Supports any language including syntax highlighting and pretty printing in HTML</li>
                <li>Generates HTML as output</li>
                <li>Generates readable code and commented in the target language</li>
                <li>Reports syntax errors back from the compiler to the right line in the literate source</li>
                <li>Runs fast -- wc.lit compiled for me in 7ms for both code and html output</li>
                <li>Markdown based -- very easy to read and write Literate source.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates hyperlinks between code sections</li>
                <li>Formatted output similar to CWEB</li>
                <li>Creates an index with identifiers used (you need to have exuberant or universal ctags installed to use this feature)</li>
                <li>Supports TeX equations with <code>$</code> notation</li>
                <li>Compatible with Vim (<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim" target="_blank">literate.vim</a>)</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
            </ul><p>
            
            You can get started by taking a look at the <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/literate/manual.html">manual</a>.
            In addition, this website is made with Literate, and the source can be viewed

The following brief post is once again offered largely for the sake of interest, being concerned with the furthest limits of the distribution of early Byzantine material in Eurasia and Africa. What follows consists of a distribution map of fifth- to seventh-century AD Byzantine finds and contemporary imitations accompanied by a brief discussion and illustration of some of the items that have been found in the far west, far east, far north and far south of the 'Old World'. Needless to say, the extensive distribution of early Byzantine material shown here is of interest for a number of reasons from the perspective of this blog, not least the light that it sheds on early medieval Britain's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">Byzantine</a> and <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/05/anglo-saxon-finds-france-africa.html">Indian Ocean</a>&nbsp;imports and connections discussed in previous posts.</p><table><tbody>

<tr><td><i>Distribution of early Byzantine items and contemporary imitations found outside of the boundaries of the mid-sixth-century empire, along with a depiction of the empire during the reign of Justinian (c. 565 AD). For a larger version of this map, click <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dSEC_2WafyA/WOS09i45muI/AAAAAAAAAv8/QR2A3JUtm4A-TMc67YlePIsUx9tXciB8QCLcB/s1600/Byzantine_exports_large_labelled.png">here</a>. The numbers refer to sections in the text, below. Note, the finds in the Kama region of Russia seem to have arrived there in the eighth to twelfth centuries from Central Asia, hence the inclusion—following Mango (ed.),&nbsp;Byzantine Trade, 4th-12th Centuries (Farnham, 2009), fig. 1.1—of a notional grouping of finds in a regular block to the southeast of the Aral Sea and an arrow indicating the relationship between these and the Russian finds.

<p><b>The Far West (1)</b></p><p>

For both <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>, writing near Bethlehem in 396, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ZUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+island+of+Britain+lies+virtually+at+the+end+of+the+world%22">Gildas</a>, writing around a century later in late fifth- or early sixth-century Britain, the British Isles lay 'virtually at the end of the world towards the west and north-west'. Despite this, there was clearly an intriguing degree of contact between the British Isles and the early Byzantine empire during the fifth to seventh centuries, as has been discussed at length in a <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">previous post</a>. In terms of the material evidence for this connection, this is manifested by significant finds of fifth- to sixth-century Eastern Mediterranean and North African <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">pottery</a> in western Britain and <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/3263">Ireland</a> (with around half of the total coming from the probable royal site of <a href="http://www.medievalhistories.com/luxury-tintagel-early-medieval-period/">Tintagel</a>, Cornwall), alongside Byzantine <a href="https://www.academia.edu/11482638/_Early_Byzantine_copper_coins_found_in_Britain_A_review_of_new_finds_recorded_with_the_Portable_Antiquities_Scheme_Ancient_History_Numismatics_and_Epigraphy_in_the_Mediterranean_World_ed._Og%C5%ADz_Tekin_Yayinlari_Istanbul_2009_263-274">coins</a>, metalwork, and a number of burials of people whose <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/10/oxygen-isotope-evidence.html">isotope results</a> indicate that they could well have grown up in Byzantine North Africa. It has <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIMmDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">often</a> been <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">suggested</a> that the material in the west may have arrived via a different mechanism to that in the east, perhaps representing direct, official contact via the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic coast vs indirect transfer via merchants and elite exchange along the rivers of mainland Europe, although finds of late sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine coins from the Anglo-Saxon royal site of Rendlesham, Suffolk, have recently been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocial-and-economic-complexity-in-early-medieval-england-a-central-place-complex-of-the-east-anglian-kingdom-at-rendlesham-suffolkdiv/FE9E1DB3180F1390E97D97BF28B637D5">interpreted</a> as evidence for 'direct mercantile contacts' with the Byzantine world in eastern Britain too.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far East (2, 3, 4)</b></p><p>

If there is a substantial amount of early Byzantine material found in Britain and Ireland, the apparent westernmost extremity of the known world in late antiquity, there is also a notable quantity at the far eastern end too. In <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>'s letter, cited above, the rhetorical opposite extremity of the world to Britain was given as India, but Roman and Byzantine authors were certainly aware of the existence of China and parts of Southeast Asia. China was, for example, mentioned by <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp261_Roman_Chinese.pdf">Roman</a> and <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">early Byzantine</a> writers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Roman_geography">first century BC onwards</a> and it is included not only in Ptolemy's second-century AD <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg">Geography</a></i> (which mentions parts of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg">Southeast Asia</a> too), but also on the <i><a href="http://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/11_india/india_8_2.html">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></i>, a fascinating map that seems to have had its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana">Late Roman period</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roman</a> and especially <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Chinese sources</a> make several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Possible_Roman_Greeks_in_Burma_and_China">references</a> to Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine entertainers, merchants and/or embassies being present in China and Southeast Asia, including a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">mission in 166 AD</a> that arrived via the south coast—probably entering China via Vietnam and claiming to have been sent by the Roman emperor <i>Andun</i> (Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus?), although this was perhaps really a commercial action that chose to represent itself this way—and numerous seventh- and eighth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Fulin:_Eastern_Roman_embassies">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://byzantineperspectives.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/what-does-tang-china-have-in-common-with-anglo-saxon-england/">embassies</a>&nbsp;to Tang China.</p><p>

In terms of the early Byzantine material found in eastern parts of Eurasia, there is a variety of surviving artefacts ranging from glass vessels, metalwork and textiles through to gold and bronze coinage, with the latter being by far the most numerous category. The most easterly early Byzantine artefacts are actually found in Korea and Japan ('2' on the map, above). The former has seen finds of <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/glass-vessels/cwFZdR3ccuXZ-w?hl=en">glass vessels</a> from the late fifth- to early sixth-century AD royal tombs at <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm">Silla, Korea</a>, some of which appear to have actually been <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpanKmU_ckYC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">made in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-19-1-1.pdf">the early Byzantine empire</a> and others of which are believed to be <a href="http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Silk_Roads/The_Eastern_Silk_Roads_Story_2015_Conference_Proceedings_UNESCO_re.pdf">imitative</a> of Late Roman/Early Byzantine forms, whilst in Japan there have been not only finds of early Byzantine 'Levantine 1' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284359734_Archaeometrical_investigation_of_natron_glass_excavated_in_Japan">glass beads</a> (probably made on the coast of present-day northern Israel) from fifth-century AD tombs, but the important mid-eighth-century AD imperial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Di">Shōsōin Repository</a> at Nara, Japan, is also reported to contain a number of Byzantine items including a <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp206_sasanian_persia.pdf">cushion cover</a> made in early Byzantine Syria. Interestingly, neither Japan nor Korea is mentioned in Roman or Byzantine sources, although a recent isotopic and mitochondrial DNA <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236210479_Stable_isotope_and_mtDNA_evidence_for_geographic_origins_at_the_site_of_Vagnari_South_Italy">study of burials</a> on the Imperial estate at Vagnari, southern Italy, has indicated that one of the adults buried there in the first or second century AD could have had Japanese ancestry, given that 'all modern mtDNA matches to her available haplotype sequence are from Japan'.<sup><a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html#fn2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

In addition to this material from the very far east, we also have a notable quantity of primarily sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">gold coins</a> and sixth- to eighth-century imitations from <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">tombs in China</a>, along with a number of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C9A7DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=RA1-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">finds</a> of early Byzantine metalwork and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-06_M-L._Chen,_The_Importation_of_Byzantine_and_Sasanian_Glass_into_China_during_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries.pdf">glassware</a> (and imitations of the same) from this country too. Both this material and that discussed in the preceding paragraph is <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">often thought</a> <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">to have arrived</a> via Central Asia along the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>', especially given the presence of a number of <a href="https://www.academia.edu/27959139/Sogdiana_its_Christians_and_Byzantium_a_Study_of_Artistic_and_Cultural_Connections_in_Late_Antiquity_and_Early_Middle_Ages">similar finds</a> in areas such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, although some of the Byzantine items found close to the Chinese coast and in Korea and Japan could have alternatively arrived by the less-discussed southern, maritime 'branch' of the Silk Road instead. Certainly, earlier <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Roman</a> and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Greek</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12682533/The_Power_of_Images_Coin_Portraits_of_Roman_Emperors_on_Jewellery_Pendants_in_Early_Southeast_Asia">mariners</a>&nbsp;made use of this route, and early Byzantine <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">written sources</a> moreover appear to make reference to it, whilst finds of fifth- to seventh-century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinrgreen/status/832976763626078211">glassware</a>&nbsp;in Japan are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/28504387/Priestman_2016_The_Silk_Road_or_the_Sea_Sasanian_and_Islamic_Exports_to_Japan">argued</a> to have probably arrived there via the sea route. With regard to this maritime 'road', another relevant find may well be that of a probably sixth-century Byzantine <a href="http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_096_0b_Borrell_EarlyByzantineLampFromPongTuk.pdf">lamp</a> found in Thailand (marked as '3' on the map, above), and it is worth noting in this context that an East Javanese <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LhaWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><i>millefiori</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebeadsite.com/abm-rio3.html">bead</a> of sixth-century date has been found at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica">Berenike</a> too (curiously, such beads are <a href="http://www.aihv.org/en/pdf/16-77.pdf">very rare indeed</a> outside of East Java, with the only other concentration really being in the Silla tombs of Korea, mentioned above!).</p><p>

Finally, thousands of fifth- to seventh-century <a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5357/1/Darley14PhD_redacted.pdf">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/10027506/Self_Other_and_the_Use_and_Appropriation_of_Late_Roman_coins_in_south_India_and_Sri_Lanka_4th-7th_centuries_A.D._">gold</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271621898_Roman_Coins_from_the_Masson_and_Mackenzie_Collections_in_the_British_Museum">bronze</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292142132_The_Role_of_Monetary_Networks_in_the_Trade_between_India_and_the_Roman_Empire">coins</a> and imitations are known from India and Sri Lanka ('4' on the map), accompanied by fifth- to sixth-century <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk:8081/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-02_K._R._Dark,_Globalizing_Late_Antiquity.pdf">amphorae</a> on coastal and inland sites in western India. Such finds support the <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">textual evidence</a> for continued <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O_AtKQAACAAJ">Indo-Roman trade</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo%E2%80%93Roman_trade_relations">interaction</a> via the Red Sea beyond the more frequently discussed Early Roman era into the Late Roman/Early Byzantine period, as do both the Indo-Pacific imports found at sites such as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Byzantine Berenike</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.academia.edu/22932720/Strontium_isotope_evidence_for_long-distance_immigration_into_the_Byzantine_port_city_of_Aila_modern_Aqaba_Jordan">isotopic analysis</a> of burials of the fourth- to fifth-century AD at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="http://maajournal.com/Issues/2012/Vol12-1/Full8.pdf">Aila</a> (Jordan), which indicates that people from areas beyond western Asia and North Africa were living there then, including some who had potentially grown up in the Indus Valley.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico"><p>The year is 1964. The United States and the Soviet Union have narrowly avoided full-scale nuclear destruction and resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War looms on the horizon, and Mao Zedong’s China—fresh off a split with the Soviets—has just successfully blown up its first atomic bomb in a dry lakebed in southeastern Xinjiang, near what is now the <a href="https://www.wildcamels.com/what-we-do/lop-nur-nature-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest reserve for Bactrian camels</a>. </p><p>China’s nuclear test announced the country as the world’s fifth nuclear-armed nation, though unlike France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese nuclear program was a black box for American intelligence. <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb488/docs/Doc%2028%2011-2-64%20inr%20on%20chinese%20test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recently declassified government files show</a>, for example, that the U.S. was shocked to learn that the bomb was fueled by uranium, not plutonium. Military-industrial honchos were left scratching their heads as to how to gather intelligence, until a chance meeting between General Curtis LeMay and mountaineer Barry Bishop at a Washington D.C. cocktail party led to one of the most quixotic, unsuccessful operations in the CIA’s long history of screwups.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="792" height="612" src="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg 792w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=62,48 62w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"><figcaption><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb488/docs/doc%2033%201-0-65%20circa%20AFtAC%20report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Air Force analysis</a> of nuclear debris scatter, which confirmed the use of enriched uranium.

Everest the year prior, and according to <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Takeda’s fascinating 2007 <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>, he gushed about the unobstructed views he enjoyed from the world’s (<a href="https://defector.com/a-geologist-rocks-my-world-on-why-earths-tallest-mountain-isnt-so-obvious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably</a>) tallest mountain. Takeda writes that LeMay put the pieces together and, “From this casual exchange emerged an unlikely inspiration: Recruit America’s best high-altitude climbers to place a nuclear powered observation device atop the world’s greatest mountain range.” The hope was that a transceiver could pick up radio communications between Chinese nuclear personnel, remaining functional for years off of the heat from decaying plutonium isotopes. Per Takeda, the CIA’s device was an “oven-sized metal bin with five radiating fins” that weighed 125 pounds and was topped by a six-foot long antenna. If this sounds like a crude product of ’60s nuclear frenzy, consider that <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s Perseverance rover</a> is scooting around on Mars thanks to this exact sort of battery. </p><p>Bishop could no longer climb high alpine peaks after <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/first-successful-us-everest-summit-took-a-toll-on-barry-bishops-boots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing all of his toes in the Everest expedition</a>, but by 1965, the CIA started putting together a team, picked a name (Operation Hat), and chose a mountain. Everest straddled China’s border, so it was out of contention. CIA officials eventually chose Nanda Devi, the tallest peak entirely within India’s borders. Nanda Devi offered two advantages to the Americans: long sightlines into Western China and the help of an Indian state that the U.S. had just supported in its 1962 border skirmish with China. </p><p>At this point in history, Nanda Devi had only been summited by six people, with three others dying in the process, so the CIA recruited a dream team of famous American climbers. The corps included pioneering El Capitan big-waller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/obituaries/tom-frost-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Frost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/us/luther-jerstad-61-alpinist-who-scaled-everest-in-1963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 Everest</a> veteran Lute Jerstad, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> cover darling <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/jim-mccarthy-was-first-climber-on-sports-illustrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim McCarthy</a>, and the unsung alpinist <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(16)31088-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Schaller</a>. They <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a training course</a> on nuclear technology and “the Asian mentality” at a South Carolina military base, though the climbers say they mostly spent time “playing volleyball and doing some serious drinking.” <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full team undertook a training mission on Mount McKinley</a> in June with their Indian counterparts, and even though “distressing weather and other difficulties kept them from the summit,” the CIA “chose to ignore” the omens and the American-Indian team set out for Nanda Devi in October 1965. </p><p>The CIA has not yet declassified files from the expedition, including apparently extensive photographs and journal records made by Schaller, so we do not have a detailed account of what happened on the mountain. But we do know how the mission ended: catastrophic failure. A storm pinned several climbers and the device down while they were roughly 1,800 feet from the summit. Indian intelligence lead Capt. M.S. Kohli was forced to call a retreat, and the team stashed the device in a crevice and attempted to anchor it in place, so it would stay put until they could come and retrieve it on the other side of winter.</p><p>McCarthy spoke at length with Takeda <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>—which really is great, Takeda makes his own attempt on Nanda Devi and narrowly escapes death by avalanche—and he recalled his fury at the expedition’s failure:</p><blockquote><p>When I realize that they’re dumping the fucking generator and going down the mountain, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing? Have them bring it down! Are you crazy?’ I’m yelling at the top of my lungs.” According to McCarthy, the CIA case officer nearly had to pull him off Kohli. “He says to me,” McCarthy says, ‘You are creating an international incident!’”</p><p>“But,” McCarthy adds, “I had a vision of absolute clarity. We’re going to lose a SNAP generator, powered by plutonium, in the headwaters of the Ganges!”</p><cite><a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock And Ice</a></cite></blockquote><p>That might be what wound up happening. Nobody knows where the device ended up, since it disappeared from Nanda Devi at some point in the winter. The CIA ran a total of eight field operations in the region between 1965 and 1968, aimed at both finding the first device and getting another one up and running. Though they eventually implanted a plutonium device on nearby Nanda Kot, they have never been able to find their lost transceiver. The successfully placed device was also quickly buried under the snow and stopped working months later, after producing no useful intelligence.</p><p>The grim failure of Operation Hat resurfaced this month after violent floods killed over 50 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The floods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/asia/india-glacier-flood-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likely began</a> when a chunk of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and trapped flowing water, forming a lake that eventually burst through and swept through nearby valleys. The undeniable oddness of a glacial breaking apart during the winter has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56102459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led some locals to speculate</a> that perhaps the plutonium generator, which is still likely producing heat, led to the deadly floods.</p><p>There’s no evidence for the hypothesis, though even after years of reconnaissance missions and rigorous chemical assays of the surrounding area, nobody knows where the CIA’s lost nuclear-powered spy oven is. </p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>
