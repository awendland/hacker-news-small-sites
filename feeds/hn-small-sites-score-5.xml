<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" alt="" width="652" height="447" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em> <a href="https://slouchingtowardsthatcham.com/2019/07/10/social-media-for-influencers-organic-reach/">Organic reach in social media is going down and will continue to do so.</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>
<h2>Privacy is a BIG Issue </h2>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>
<h2>There Are Other Concerns</h2>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6054437144226106686" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
    Under general relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead it is a distortion of spacetime. Objects in free-fall move along geodesics (straight lines) in spacetime, as seen in the inertial frame of reference on the right. When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen on the left.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this system there is only one space dimension, shown on the vertical axis and labeled in meters. The time dimension is the horizontal axis and labeled in seconds. The gravitational field is constant within the area of interest. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the first slider to change the acceleration of the frame of reference in the middle. When the frame has zero acceleration it is said to be an inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the second slider to move the time window. Note that all the trajectories remain as straight lines in the inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can drag the start and end position of each object to change their trajectories. All free-fall trajectories in the inertial frame of reference are straight lines.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the more helpful frameworks that I’ve found in my career has been to aggressively avoid unforced errors in management. In tennis, unforced errors are cases where a player missed a shot due to their own mistake, rather than due to their opponent. In management, unforced errors are problems where the source is <em>you</em>, rather than an objective business need or external circumstance.</p>

<p>I define unforced errors as problems caused by taking action, when doing absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> would have worked just fine: cases when you mess with something that wasn’t broken in the first place. In addition to being annoying, unforced errors distract from existing priorities and open up new fronts in any battles that you’re currently engaged in. And since the solution is so easy – just do nothing – learning how to identify them can pay dividends.</p>

<h2 id="common-types-of-unforced-errors">Common Types of Unforced Errors</h2>

<p>Unforced errors generally come in a few easy to identify forms.</p>

<p>The most common is deciding to “fix” a problem that doesn’t matter, or that doesn’t exist at all. One of the prototypical examples is the decision to migrate to a new technology stack because it seems cool, or because your current technology choice is no longer in vogue. Maybe you’re running Ruby or PHP but really want to try out Rust, despite the fact that your product is otherwise working fine and you’re not having trouble finding and retaining engineers. This invention of a problem can lead to Tech Debt Science Projects in which your team rebuilds otherwise working technology. If anything breaks (it likely will), you’ve caused an unforced error.</p>

<p>Another class of unforced errors comes from deciding to standardize or regulate a system that’s working fine. For example, imagine a case where your engineering teams are all running agile processes differently. Some teams aren’t disciplined about retrospectives, some teams are highly regimented about story sizing while others wing it, and some teams occasionally insert “break” weeks in between sprints so that schedules never quite align. To a certain kind of person, this type of inconsistency feels deeply wrong – like a house in which all of the walls were a very slightly different color.</p>

<p>But your business doesn’t require consistency for aesthetic purposes, or for its own sake. In some situations, you can tolerate somewhat haphazard team processes for a surprisingly long time – dodging the upfront effort of standardization, the ongoing effort of maintaining it, and the overall risk of standardizing on a system that doesn’t actually help everyone on balance. (of course, if there are real upsides to enforcing consistency then you should go for it)</p>

<h2 id="catching-unforced-errors-before-they-happen">Catching Unforced Errors Before They Happen</h2>

<p>In my experience unforced errors often stem from a yearning for control. When times are tough it can be tempting to latch onto areas where you already have mastery and look for ways to optimize them, and this optimization feels like productive work. Ironically, this means that you’re more likely to cause unforced errors, as these familiar domains are areas where you’re probably doing well – focus is needed in the areas of the business that you rarely think about, where your existing decisions are the least battle-tested.</p>

<p>The general solution to unforced errors is to ruthlessly prioritize. Focus on the problems that are truly existential threats to your business and team, or represent transformational opportunities.</p>

<p>My simple heuristic for avoiding unforced errors is to always imagine the worst thing that can happen if you just skip a new project – what would happen if you had never thought about this initiative at all? This is especially true when you’re talking about changing something rather than doing something new. If the worst that happens is that you miss a chance for a 5-10% optimization of a non-essential part of your business, alarm bells should be gently ringing.</p>

<p>Unforced errors are a pain – not only do they distract, but the optics can be pretty bad when a lot of hard work backfires. By avoiding these hiccups, you can keep your team happier and focus on getting the wins that are most important to your business.</p>

You may be using Mastodon wrong

<p>October 18, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa

<p>I'm sure you have already heard about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>,
typically marketed as <em>a Twitter alternative</em>.</p>

<p>I will try to convince you that the word <em>alternative</em> doesn't mean here what you think it means,
and why you may be using Mastodon wrong if you find it boring.</p>

<h4>An alternative community</h4>

<p>You should not expect to "migrate from Twitter to Mastodon."</p>

<p>Forget about the privacy angle for now. Mastodon is an alternative community, where people behave
differently.</p>

<p><strong>It's your chance to make new internet friends.</strong></p>

<p>There may be some people for whom Mastodon is a safe haven. Yes, some users really do migrate
there to avoid censorship or bullying but, for most of us, that will not be the case.</p>

<p>Let's put it this way: Mastodon is to Twitter what Linux is to Windows.</p>

<p>Linux is libre software. But that's not why most people use it. Linux users mostly want 
to get their work done, and Linux is an excellent platform.
There is no Microsoft Word, no Adobe Photoshop, no Starcraft. If you need to use these tools, honestly,
you'd better stick with Windows. You can use emulation, in the same way that there are
utilities to post to Twitter from Mastodon, but that would miss the point.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you can perform the same tasks, but the process will be different.
You can post <em>toots</em> on Mastodon, upload gifs, send DMs... but it's not Twitter, and that is fine.</p>

<h4>The Local Timeline is Mastodon's greatest invention</h4>

<p>The problem most people have with Mastodon is that they "get bored" with it quickly. I've seen it a lot, and
it means one thing: <strong>the person created their account on the wrong server</strong>.</p>

<p>"But," they say, "isn't Mastodon federated? Can't I chat with everybody, regardless of their server?"
Yes, of course. But discoverability works differently on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Twitter has only two discoverability layers: your network and the whole world. Either a small group of
contacts, or everybody in the whole world. That's crazy.</p>

<p>They try very hard to show you tweets from outside your network so you can discover new people.
And, at the same time, they show your tweets to third parties, so you can get new followers.
This is the way that
they try to keep you engaged once your network is more or less stable and starts getting stale.</p>

<p>Mastodon, instead, has an extra layer between your network and the whole world:
messages from <em>people on your server</em>. This is called the <em>local timeline</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The local timeline is the key to enjoying Mastodon.</strong></p>

<h4>How long it's been since you made a new internet friend?</h4>

<p>If you're of a certain age you may remember BBSs, Usenet, the IRC, or early internet forums.
Do you recall how exciting it was to log into the unknown and realize that there were people
all around the world who shared your interests?</p>

<p>It was an amazing feeling which got lost on the modern internet. Now you have a chance to relive it.</p>

<p>The local timeline dynamics are very different. There is a lot of respectful interactions among total strangers,
because there is this feeling of community, of being in a neighborhood. Twitter is just the opposite, strangers
shouting at each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the local timeline is more or less limited in the amount of users, you have the chance
to recognize usernames, and being recognized. You start interacting with strangers, mentioning them, sending them
links they may like. You discover new websites, rabbit holes, new approaches to your hobbies.</p>

<p>I've made quite a few new <em>internet friends</em> on my Mastodon server, and I don't mean followers or contacts.
I'm talking about human beings who I have never met in person but feel close to.</p>

<p>People are humble and respectful. And, for less nice users, admins enforce codes of conduct and, 
on extreme cases, users may get kicked off a server. But they are not being banned by a faceless corporation
due to mass reports, everybody is given a chance.</p>

<h4>How to choose the right server</h4>

<p>The problem with "generalist" Mastodon servers like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>
is that users have just too diverse interests and backgrounds.
Therefore, there is no community feeling. For some people, that may be exactly what they're looking for. But, 
for most of us, there is more value on the smaller servers.</p>

<p>So, how can you choose the right server? Fortunately, you can do a bit of research. 
There is an official <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities">directory of Mastodon servers</a> categorized by
interests and regions. </p>

<p>Since you're reading my blog, start by taking a look at these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bsd.network/">bsd.network</a>, for fans of BSD systems</li>
<li><a href="http://linuxrocks.online/">linuxrocks.online</a>, for Linux fans</li>
<li><a href="http://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, for free software in general</li>
<li><a href="http://tilde.zone/">tilde.zone</a>, for oldschool internet users</li>
<li><a href="https://merveilles.town/">merveilles.town</a>, with a very particular mixture of art and technology</li>
<li><a href="https://metalhead.club/">metalhead.club</a>, to enjoy those classic riffs</li>
</ul>

<p>And the regionals</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodont.cat/">mastodont.cat</a> for catalans</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.madrid/">mastodon.madrid</a> for madrileños</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more. Simply search online for "mastodon server MY_FAVORITE_HOBBY." And believe me, servers
between 500 and 5,000 people are the best.</p>

<h4>Final tips</h4>

<p>Before clicking on "sign up", always browse the local timeline,
the about page, and the most active users list. You will get a pretty good idea of the kind of people
who chat there.
Once you feel right at home you can continue your adventure and start following users from other servers.</p>

<p>Mastodon has an option to only display toots in specific languages. It can be very useful to avoid being
flooded by toots that you just have no chance of understanding or even getting what they're about.</p>

<p>You can also filter your notifications by types: replies, mentions, favorites, reposts, and more.
This makes catching up much more manageable than on Twitter.</p>

<p>Finally, Mastodon has a built-in "Content Warning" feature. It allows you to hide
text behind a short explanation, in case you want to talk about sensible topics or just about spoiling
a recent movie.</p>

<p>Good luck with your search, and see you on the Fediverse! I'm at

  <p>This article considers the conditions that lead teams to produce overengineered software and describes how you can avoid falling prey to such conditions.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-overengineering">What do we mean by “overengineering”?</h2>

<p>When a software developer says that a piece of software is <em>overengineered</em>, they are saying that they think it has too many moving parts, too much abstraction, or an excessive emphasis on performance. The number of concepts required to understand the thing feels unreasonable.</p>

<p>It’s a fundamentally subjective call, but you know it when you see it. Like a Ferrari at a go kart race, an overengineered system is out of scale with its operating environment and intended usage.</p>

<p>But how does it happen? Are there certain conditions that lead teams to produce systems that observers would perceive as overengineered?</p>

<p>To determine this, let’s consider two stereotypical software
engineering phenomena: cargo culting and a related pattern that I’ve
started to call “the Xoogler effect”.</p>

<p>From there, we can characterize certain cognitive biases that drive a team towards overengineering.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-culting">​​Cargo culting</h2>
<p><img src="https://evanm.website/images/overengineering/cloudnativelandscape.jpg" alt="The Trillion Dollar Homepage"><span>Fig. 1. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">The Trillion Dollar Homepage</a>.</span></p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> is a cultural phenomenon in which technologically-advanced artifacts become objects of obsessive ritual to a group of people outside of the artifact-producing society. While the term has fallen out of favor within the field of anthropology (in acknowledgement of its reductive and colonialist overtones), it’s fairly common in software circles.</p>

<p>To a software engineer, “cargo culting” is used pejoratively to refer to the adoption of a technology or practice based solely on its origin or popularity. Loosely, the thinking goes that if a tool, language, or convention was developed at or inspired by ideas from a large, successful company, then that tool must have contributed to the company’s success. Thus, in adopting it, you increase your odds of also succeeding.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Era-defining companies like Intel and Google used OKRs, so we should too.”</li>
  <li>“The SRE book talks about how Google relies on service level objectives, so using them will help our services become more reliable.”</li>
  <li>“Most successful companies end up needing advanced load balancing and request-proxying systems to scale their microservices architectures. Our 10-person startup should adopt these systems in order to help us scale.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Like incorporating in Delaware or only hiring graduates of name-brand universities, a particular practice correlating with notable instances of company growth doesn’t imply causation. Just because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">popular or successful</a> company uses a technology doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate or worthwhile for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-xoogler-effect">The Xoogler effect</h2>

<p>When people leave engineering jobs at big, successful tech companies, they take their former employer’s engineering culture with them. This tends to be highly valuable, for both the technical acumen of the new company and the incoming engineer’s compensation package.</p>

<p>But this tendency can be taken too far. The incoming employee, believing that they have a direct line to the state of the art, may go on to recreate systems in their former employer’s image to an unreasonable degree.</p>

<p>Not to pick on Googlers, but something about that company’s culture really brings this out. There are many notable examples of Xooglers replicating Google-internal systems and practices in the outside world, either as independent startups or efforts within existing companies. I don’t find this terribly surprising, given the tone that’s set within Google—you spend your time there constantly being told that you’re among the best software engineers to walk the face of the Earth, using technologies unmatched in their power, quality, and scalability. It makes sense that former employees feel compelled to emulate things that worked at Google<sup><a id="fn1ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But this generalizes to other large and/or successful companies. Many people leave the productivity bubble of a “FAANG and friends” company and end up building tools and systems that they miss. To name but a few, this is how we got Thrift, Envoy, and <a href="https://bazel.build/">three</a> <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">different</a> <a href="https://buck.build/">tools</a> based on Google’s build system.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-biases">Cognitive biases</h2>

<p>I think these two phenomena can be linked to a handful of widely-known cognitive biases. Cargo culting is a clear manifestation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">authority bias</a>. And the Xoogler effect seems related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">the law of the instrument</a>.</p>

<p>It’s rational to want to stay within your <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>, but it can be counterproductive in excess. When you’ve been inculcated in the expert use of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. Your thinking in new environments is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> by prior experience in old environments, which can impede learning and the development of new skills.</p>

<p>And it turns out that these two patterns can feed on each other. Cargo culting is <em>catalyzed by</em> the Xoogler effect in cases when a former big company employee’s experience is uncritically venerated by new colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-resist-the-urge-to-overengineer">How to resist the urge to overengineer</h2>

<p>Resisting the temptation to overengineer requires one to be honest with themselves about the context in which they’re operating.</p>

<p>You should always design systems to address problems that are in front of you instead of falling for solutions to problems faced by big companies in the past. You shouldn’t base your company’s infrastructure on GitHub stars. And as wistful as you may be for your last company’s tools, they may not be as applicable to your current situation as you think.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-cargo-without-becoming-a-cultist">Assessing cargo without becoming a cultist</h3>

<p>When evaluating a popular tool, language, or convention, it’s worthwhile to take the time to understand the underlying forces that motivated its invention<sup><a id="fn2ref" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Before making any decisions, try to contextualize a technology within the environment that formed it. From there, you can pattern match that environment to your own in order to determine if the technology is appropriate.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s consider everyone’s favorite overengineering punching bag: Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Kubernetes traces its conceptual lineage to Borg<sup><a id="fn3ref" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, the cluster-management system that’s run Google’s production workloads for over a dozen years. The main value that Borg provides to Alphabet is its ability to maximize the capital efficiency of their datacenters. The technology that we now call “container orchestration” allowed them to get more computing oomph out of their fleet by maximizing utilization and making more efficient use of machines they’d already paid for.</p>

<p>Is maximizing capital efficiency of your datacenter or cloud environment a concern for your company? If you believe Kubernetes offers other benefits<sup><a id="fn4ref" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>, are you confident that they outweigh the complexity and maintenance overhead?</p>

<p>I find this thought process helpful when evaluating new tools, patterns, frameworks, or management practices. Conventional wisdom advocates that you fully understand a problem before applying a solution to it. It’s also important to understand the conditions that led to a solution and how those conditions align with those you find yourself in.</p>

<p>Regardless of the decision you end up making, this process is likely to make you a better engineer. The job is fundamentally about building systems to solve problems at reasonable cost. That cost is measured not only as upfront capital expenditure, but in the ongoing drag associated with maintenance and cognitive load. More often than we realize, engineering is about right-sizing a solution in light of these ongoing costs.</p>

        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for programming in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> Programming Language and in other text editing environments that require a wide range of specialist and technical Unicode characters. It was intended as a fun experiment to be presented at the 2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal (which of course didn’t physically happen in Lisbon, but online).</p><p>The original temporary website used JuliaMono everywhere, so let's try to make the rest of this page do the same.</p><div><p>To download and install JuliaMono, see the instructions <a href="#download_and_install">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are different weights of JuliaMono, so you can control the amount of contrast you have in your highlighted code: <span>JuliaMono-Light</span>, JuliaMono-Regular, <span>JuliaMono-Medium</span>, <span>JuliaMono-Bold</span>, <span>JuliaMono-ExtraBold</span>, and <span>JuliaMono-Black</span>. <sup id="fnref:masters"><a href="#fndef:masters">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>(There are also versions of two of the fonts with “Latin” in the name: these are stripped down versions supporting just the basic MacRoman/Windows1252 “Latin” character sets, intended for use as place-holders, of interest mainly if you want to have more control over font loading times in web browser-based applications.)</p>
<p>In the hands of a virtuoso (such as Dr Zygmunt Szpak, the author of the following Julia code fragment<sup id="fnref:zscode"><a href="#fndef:zscode">[4]</a></sup>), the range of available Unicode characters can be quite expressive:</p>
<pre><code>function T(𝛉::AbstractArray,
           𝒞::Tuple{AbstractArray,
           Vararg{AbstractArray}},
           𝒟::Tuple{AbstractArray, Vararg{AbstractArray}})
    ⊗ = kron
    l = length(𝛉)
    𝐈ₗ = SMatrix{l,l}(1.0I)
    𝐈ₘ = SMatrix{1,1}(1.0I)
    𝐓 = @SMatrix zeros(l,l)
    N = length(𝒟[1])
    ℳ, ℳʹ = 𝒟
    Λ₁, Λ₂ = 𝒞
    𝚲ₙ = @MMatrix zeros(4,4)
    𝐞₁ = @SMatrix [1.0; 0.0; 0.0]
    𝐞₂ = @SMatrix [0.0; 1.0; 0.0]
    for n = 1:N
        index = SVector(1,2)
        𝚲ₙ[1:2,1:2] .=  Λ₁[n][index,index]
        𝚲ₙ[3:4,3:4] .=  Λ₂[n][index,index]
        𝐦    = hom(ℳ[n])
        𝐦ʹ   = hom(ℳʹ[n])

<p>One of the goals of JuliaMono is to include most of the characters that a typical programmer would reasonably expect to find. (Except for all those emojis - they are best handled by the operating system.) Here’s a thousand or so chosen at random:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicode-sample.svg" width="100%" alt="Unicode sampler"></p><p>In JuliaMono, every character is the same width, because this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced</a> typeface. Usually, typefaces with a lot of Unicode mathematical symbols are not monospaced, because they’re intended for use in prose and \( \LaTeX \) applications, rather than in programming code.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, forcing every character into the same size box is a problem. It’s like fitting every human being of whatever shape or size into identical airplane seats - some characters are bound to look uncomfortable. There’s never quite enough room for a nice-looking “m” or “w”.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl">UnicodePlots.jl</a> uses various Unicode characters to plot figures directly in a terminal window. <sup id="fnref:linespacing"><a href="#fndef:linespacing">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicodeplots.png" alt="UnicodePlots in action"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageInTerminal.jl">ImageInTerminal.jl</a> is similarly awesome, conjuring images from Unicode characters:</p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/imageinterminal.png" alt="ImageInTerminal"></p><p>JuliaMono is quite greedy<sup id="fnref:greedy"><a href="#fndef:greedy">[7]</a></sup>, and contains a lot of Unicode glyphs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/barchart.svg" width="100%" alt="silly barchart"></p><p>(Of course, size isn’t everything - quality can beat quantity, and other fonts will offer different experiences<sup id="fnref:otherfonts"><a href="#fndef:otherfonts">[8]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to support box-drawing characters and DataFrames.jl output (terminal permitting):</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; df = DataFrame(A=samples, B=glyphs)
df = 10×2 DataFrame

<p>(Can you spot the little used and sadly mathematically-unsupported "times" character?)</p>
<p>If you want to know whether you can use a Unicode character as an identifier in your Julia code, use the undocumented function <code>Base.isidentifier()</code>. So, for example, if you have the urge to use a dingbat (one of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats">Herman Zapf dingbat</a> designs), you could look for something suitable in the output of this:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; for n in 0x2700:0x27bf
			Base.isidentifier(string(Char(n))) &amp;&amp; print(Char(n))

<p>JuliaMono is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a> typeface. OpenType technology provides powerful text positioning, pattern matching, and glyph substitution features, which are essential for languages such as Arabic and Urdu. In English, OpenType features are often seen when letter pairs such as <span>fi</span> in certain fonts are replaced by a single glyph such as <span>ﬁ</span>. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature">ligatures</a> have been used ever since printing with moveable type was invented, replacing the occasional awkward character combination with a better-looking alternative.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not a big fan of their use in coding fonts (and I’m not the only one<sup id="fnref:nottheonlyone"><a href="#fndef:nottheonlyone">[9]</a></sup>). I like to see exactly what I’ve typed, rather than what the font has decided to replace it with. But, there are a few places in Julia where suitable Unicode alternatives are not accepted by the language, and where I feel that the ASCII-art confections currently used can be gently enhanced by the judicious use of alternate glyphs. There are also a few places where some subtle tweaks can enhance the readability of the language without introducing ambiguity.</p>
<p>In JuliaMono, the following substitutions are applied when the <strong>contextual alternates</strong> feature is active:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <th><p>typed</p></th>
    <th><p>displayed</p></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>::</td>
    <td>::</td>
    </tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>You can see these in action in the following code fragment:<sup id="fnref:width"><a href="#fndef:width">[10]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>julialang = true # (!= 0)
(x, y) -&gt; (x + y)
f(p::Int) = p * p
@inbounds if f in (Base.:+, Base.:-)
    if any(x -&gt; x &lt;: AbstractArray{&lt;:Number})
         nouns = Dict(
            Base.:+ =&gt; "addition",
            Base.:- =&gt; "subtraction",
        )
    end
end
df2 = df |&gt;
    @groupby(_.a) |&gt;
    @map({a = key(_), b = mean(_.b)}) |&gt;
    DataFrame # &lt;|</code></pre>
<p>OpenType fonts also offer you the ability to choose different designs for certain characters. These are stored as a ‘stylistic set’.</p>
<p>All the options are stored in the font, and are often referred to by their internal four letter code (not the best user-oriented design, really). For example, the contextual alternates listed above are collectively stored in the <strong>calt</strong> feature.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an application will show the options more visually in a Typography panel<sup id="fnref:typographypanel"><a href="#fndef:typographypanel">[11]</a></sup>, usually tucked away somewhere on a Font chooser dialog.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the stylistic sets currently available in JuliaMono.</p>

<p>
     The instruction set of the PDP-11 was designed towards a clean,
     general, symmetric instruction set.  It can be used as a
     register-based, stack-based, or memory-based machine, depending
     on the programmer's preferences.  Interrupt responsiveness is
     also important, supported with multiple interrupt levels for
     real-time computing as well as allowing for a separate interrupt
     handler for each device that generates interrupts.
</p><p>
     Word length is 16 bits with the leftmost, most significant bit
     (MSB) being bit 15.  There are eight general registers of 16 bits
     each.  Register 7 is the program counter (PC) and, by convention,
     Register 6 is the stack pointer (SP).  There is also a Processor
     Status Register/Word (PSW) which indicates the 4 condition code
     bits (N, Z, V, C), the Trace Trap bit, processor interrupt
     priority, and 4 bits for current and previous operating modes.
     Addressing on the -11 is linear from memory address 0 through
     177777.  Memory management allows access to physical memory with
     addresses of up to 22 bits (17777777).  All I/O devices,
     registers etc are addressed as if they were part of memory.
     These live in the 4KW of reserved memory space at the top of the
     addressing range.  Additionally, on most implementations of the
     PDP-11 architecture, the processor's registers are memory-mapped
     to the range 17777700-17777717 (there are many control registers
     beyond just the general registers, the specifics vary between
     implementations).  Thus Register 2 (R2) has an address of
     17777702.  All word memory addresses are even, except for registers.
     In byte operations, an even address specifies the least-significant
     byte and an odd address specifies the most-significant byte.
     Specifying an odd byte in a word operation will return an odd
     address trap.  Memory addresses from 0 to 400 octal are reserved
     for various exception traps such as timeouts, reserved
     instructions, parity, etc., and device interrupts.
</p><p>
     Addressing for the Single Operand, Double Operand and
     Jump instructions is achieved via six bits:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|_|_|_|
                         |Mode |Reg  |
</pre><p>
     where the modes are as follows: (Reg = Register, Def = Deferred)
</p><pre>     Mode 0  Reg           Direct addressing of the register
     Mode 1  Reg Def       Contents of Reg is the address
     Mode 2  AutoIncr      Contents of Reg is the address, then Reg incremented
     Mode 3  AutoIncrDef   Content of Reg is addr of addr, then Reg Incremented
     Mode 4  AutoDecr      Reg is decremented then contents is address
     Mode 5  AutoDecrDef   Reg is decremented then contents is addr of addr
     Mode 6  Index         Contents of Reg + Following word is address
     Mode 7  IndexDef      Contents of Reg + Following word is addr of addr
</pre><p>
     Note that the right-most bit of the mode is an indirection bit.
</p><p>
     Although not special cases, when dealing with R7 (aka the PC), some of
     these operations are called different things:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|1|1|1|
                         |Mode |  R7 |

     Mode 2  Immediate     Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 3  Absolute      Address of Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 6  Relative      Instr address+4+Next word is Address
     Mode 7  RelativeDef   Instr address+4+Next word is Address of address
</pre><p>
     Mainstream instructions are broken into Single operand and Double
     operand instructions, which in turn can be word or byte instructions.
</p>
<h2>Double Operand Instructions</h2>
<pre>                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                     |b|i|i|i|s|s|s|s|s|s|d|d|d|d|d|d|

                     | | Op  | Source    |  Dest     |
</pre><p>
     Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and
     byte-sized (b=1) operands.  In the table below, the mnemonics and
     names are given in the order b=0/b=1.
</p><p>
     The double operand instructions are:
</p><dl>

              </dt><dd>Compares values by subtracting the destination
              from the source, setting the condition codes, and
              then discarding the result of the subtraction.
</dd><dt>b 011 ssssss dddddd -- BIT/BITB  <i>Bit Test Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Performs a bit-wise AND of the source and the

</dd><dt>b 100 ssssss dddddd -- BIC/BICB  <i>Bit Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is cleared
              in the destination.  This is accomplished by taking the
              ones-complement of the source and ANDing it with the
              destination.  The result of the AND is stored in the
              destination.
</dd><dt>b 101 ssssss dddddd -- BIS/BISB  <i>Bit Set Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is set in
              the destination.  This is accomplished by ORing the
              source and destination, and storing the result in the
              destination.

              Note that this is a special case for b=1, in that
              it does not indicate that byte-wide operands are

</p><dl>
          <dt>b 000 000 011 dddddd -- SWAB/BPL   <i>Swap Bytes/Branch Plus</i>
              </dt><dd>Swap bytes exchanges the two bytes found in the
              destination, writing the result back to it.
<p>
              The branch (b=1) is described in the section on
              branches, below.
</p><p>
              Note that SWAB is actually a bit pattern from the
              range reserved for branches.  This particular
              pattern is otherwise unused, as it would be a
              modification of BR, Branch Always, which has no
              obvious semantics.
</p></dd><dt>b 000 101 000 dddddd -- CLR/CLRB   <i>Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Sets all the bits in destination to zero.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 001 dddddd -- COM/COMB   <i>Complement Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Calculates the ones-complement of the operand,
              and stores it.  The ones-complement is formed by

</dd><dt>b 000 101 010 dddddd -- INC/INCB   <i>Increment Word/Byte</i>

		</div><p>BERLIN — The European Union aims to spend up to €10 billion over the next seven years to help build up a homegrown cloud computing sector that could rival foreign corporations such as Amazon, Google and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Twenty-five EU countries signed a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-next-generation-cloud-europe" target="_blank">joint declaration</a> Thursday pledging public money to power up the cloud sector and establishing the "European Alliance on Industrial Data and Cloud," a partnership geared toward facilitating such projects.</p>
<p>The alliance — whose funding is to be drawn from existing EU programs and hoped-for pledges from industry and national capitals — will be launched by the end of the year. Cyprus and Denmark were the only EU member countries not to sign the declaration due to “technical reasons.”</p>
<p>The declaration “is a foundation stone for the establishment of European cloud technology, which will be very high performing,” said Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, following a meeting of European telecoms ministers organized by the German government, which currently holds the EU’s rotating Council presidency.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the prejudices, we are not late [on cloud development]. We are the first to get involved in the industrial cloud,” he added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services” — <em>Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The cloud alliance is a key part of the European Commission’s data strategy, which aims to create a single market for industrial data. Commissioner Breton in particular has lobbied hard to make the EU a worldwide data hub, and to develop data processing capabilities that would give Europe an edge over foreign rivals that currently dominate the cloud business.</p>
<p>It also fits in with broader efforts by European policymakers to make the Continent less dependent on foreign technology. Currently, U.S. technology firms dominate the global market for cloud storage.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the bloc is set to unveil by December a rulebook for platforms dubbed the “Digital Services Act," as well as binding laws for artificial intelligence that are set to be released early next year.</p>
<p>The new alliance will have the mandate to develop business, investment and implementation plans for European cloud technologies in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Signatories also pledge to create common European standards and policy norms to create pan-European cloud services, and help small and medium-sized businesses, startups and the public sector embrace cloud technology.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve digital sovereignty, we need to start approaching data processing the way major American and Chinese companies — the hyper-scalers — approach it,” said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.</p>
<p>“This is an area where we’re far from being equals,” he added.</p>
<h3>Money, money, money</h3>
<p>The Commission’s plan is to invest up to €10 billion to develop Europe's cloud and data infrastructures.</p>
<p>The EU’s executive arm would invest €2 billion from programs in its long-term budget such as the Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility 2 and InvestEU.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will come from both industry and member countries. National governments will be able to fund these projects through the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan, which has earmarked 20 percent toward digital projects.</p>
<p>The joint cloud declaration also issues demands to non-European cloud companies.</p>
<p>Cloud providers must “guarantee European standards in terms of security, data protection, consumer protection, data portability and energy efficiency and contribute to European digital sovereignty.”</p>
<p>The companies must offer “adequate assurance” that the EU will maintain control over its strategic and sensitive data.</p>
<p>“While all cloud providers are welcome in European cloud federation, the resulting cloud capacities should not be subject to laws of foreign jurisdictions,” the declaration read.</p>
<p>One of the first initiatives to come out of Europe’s cloud push is Gaia-X, a much-hyped European effort spearheaded by Germany and France to build up a European platform that sets common standards for cloud technology. Gaia-X has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1449266">limited</a> the voting rights of non-European cloud computing companies, and they cannot become directors of the association.</p>
<p>ETNO, the association representing Europe’s leading telecom operators, applauded the move.</p>
<p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services. We call for EU targets and commitments that reflect the demand side of the cloud investment story,” said Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general.</p>
<p>Tech lobby DigitalEurope was equally supportive, and announced it was applying for membership in Gaia-X.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Previously, we took a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pytorch-pipeline/">simple video pipeline</a> and made it as fast as we could without sacrificing the flexibility of the Python runtime. It’s amazing how far you can go — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">9 FPS to 650 FPS</a> — but we did not reach full hardware utilization and the pipeline did not scale linearly beyond a single GPU. There is evidence (measured using <a href="https://github.com/chrisjbillington/gil_load">gil_load</a>) that we were throttled by a fundamental Python limitation with multiple threads fighting over the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (GIL).</p>
<p>In this article we’ll take performance of the same <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300 model</a> even further, leaving Python behind and moving towards true production deployment technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html"><strong>TorchScript.</strong></a> Instead of running directly in the Pytorch runtime, we’ll export our model using TorchScript tracing into a form that can be executed portably using the <code>libtorch</code> C++ runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt"><strong>TensorRT.</strong></a> This toolset from Nvidia includes a “deep learning inference optimizer” — a compiler for optimizing CUDA-based computational graphs. We’ll use this to squeeze out every drop of inference efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk"><strong>DeepStream.</strong></a> While <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Gstreamer</a> gives us an extensive library of elements to build media pipelines with, DeepStream expands this library with a set of GPU-accelerated elements specialized for machine learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies fit together like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/deepstream_hybrid.svg" alt="DeepStream Hybrid Architecture"></p>
<p>This article will not be a step-by-step tutorial with code examples, but will show what is possible when these technologies are combined. The associated repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>.</p>
<h3 id="torchscript-vs-tensorrt">
  🔥TorchScript vs TensorRT🔥
  <a href="#torchscript-vs-tensorrt">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Both TorchScript and TensorRT can produce a deployment-ready form of our model, so why do we need both? These great tools may eventually be competitors but in 2020 they are complementary — they each have weaknesses that are compensated for by the other.</p>
<p><strong>TorchScript.</strong> With a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code we can generate a deployment-ready asset from essentially any Pytorch model that will run anywhere libtorch runs. It’s not inherently faster (it is submitting approximately the same sequence of kernels) but the libtorch runtime will perform better under high concurrency. However, without care TorchScript output may have performance and portability surprises (I’ll cover some of these in a later article).</p>
<p><strong>TensorRT.</strong> An unparalleled model compiler for Nvidia hardware, but for Pytorch or <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a>-based models it has incomplete support and suffers from poor portability. There is a plugin system to add arbitrary layers and postprocessing, but this low-level work is out of reach for groups without specialized deployment teams. TensorRT also doesn’t support cross-compilation so models must be optimized directly on the target hardware — not great for embedded platforms or highly diverse compute ecosystems.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a baseline from the previous post in this series — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">Object Detection from 9 FPS to 650 FPS in 6 Steps</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/#stage-2-postprocessing-on-gpu">Postprocessing on GPU</a> stage from my previous post is logically closest to our first DeepStream pipeline. This was a fairly slow, early stage in the Python-based optimization journey but limitations in DeepStream around batching and memory transfer make this the best comparison.</p>
<p>This Python-based pipeline runs at around 80 FPS:</p>








<p>After we get a basic DeepStream pipeline up and running we’ll empirically understand and then remove the limitations we see.</p>

<p>Our approach to using TorchScript and TensorRT together in a DeepStream pipeline will be to construct a hybrid model with two sequential components — a TensorRT frontend passing results to a TorchScript backend which completes the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">
  Hybrid DeepStream Pipeline
  <a href="#hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our hybrid pipeline will eventually use the <code>nvinfer</code> element of DeepStream to serve a TensorRT-compiled form of the SSD300 model directly in the media pipeline. Since TensorRT cannot compile the entire model (due to unsupported <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> ops) we’ll run the remaining operations as a TorchScript module (via <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/plugin-manual/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_details.html#wwpID0E0TDB0HA">the <code>parse-bbox-func-name</code> hook</a>).</p>
<p>However, the first pipeline will be the simplest possible while still following the hybrid pattern. The TensorRT model does no processing and simply passes frames to the TorchScript model, which does all preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. 0% TensorRT, 100% TorchScript.</p>
<p>This pipeline runs at 110 FPS without tracing overhead. However, this TorchScript model has already been converted to <code>fp16</code> precision so a direct comparison to the Python-based pipeline is a bit misleading.</p>








<p>Let’s drill into the trace with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nvidia’s Nsight Systems</a> to understand the patterns of execution. I have zoomed in to the processing for two 16-frame batches:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch_hu85cb8d526cf1fda403db89df3e60bf80_432723_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the red NVTX ranges on the <code>GstNvInfer</code> line we can see overlapping ranges where batches of 16 frames are being processed. However, the pattern of processing on the GPU is quite clear from the 16 utilisation spikes — it is processing frame-by-frame.  We also see constant memory transfers between device and host.</p>
<p>Drilling in to see just two frames of processing, the pattern is even more clear:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_421239_896x540_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="540">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>With a little knowledge of how DeepStream works the problem is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> sends batches of frames to the configured model engine (our empty TensorRT component) — great.</li>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> then sends the model output <em>frame by frame</em> to the postprocessing hook (our TorchScript component).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we have put our entire model into a TorchScript postprocessing hook we are now processing frame by frame with no batching, and this is causing very low GPU utilisation. (This is why we are comparing against a Python pipeline with no batching).</p>
<p><strong>We are using DeepStream contrary to the design</strong>, but to build a truly hybrid TensorRT and TorchScript pipeline we need batched postprocessing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing Hooks are Frame-by-Frame</strong></p>
<p>The design of <code>nvinfer</code> assumes model output will be postprocessed frame-by-frame. This makes writing postprocessing code a tiny bit easier but is inefficient by default. Preprocessing, inference and postprocessing logic should always assume a batch dimension is present.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Nsight Systems view above also shows a pointless sequence of device-to-host then host-to-device transfers. The purple device-to-host memory transfer is due to <code>nvinfer</code> sending tensors to system memory, ready for the postprocessing code to use it. The green host-to-device transfers are me putting this memory back on the GPU where it belongs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing is Assumed to Happen on Host</strong></p>
<p>This is a legacy of early machine learning approaches. Modern deep learning pipelines keep data on the GPU end-to-end, including data augmentation and postprocessing. See Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI">DALI library</a> for an example of this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, time to hack DeepStream and remove these limitations.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Nvidia have provided source for the <code>nvinfer</code> pipeline element. I’ve made two changes to better support our approach of doing significant work in the postprocessing hook and fix the above limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> model engine output is now sent in a single batch to the postprocessing hook.</li>
<li>Model output tensors are no-longer copied to host, but are left on the device.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  These <code>nvinfer</code> changes are unreleased and are not present in the companion repository (<a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>) because they are clearly derivative of <code>nvinfer</code> and I’m unsure of the licensing. Nvidia people, feel free to get in touch: <a href="mailto:paul@paulbridger.com">paul@paulbridger.com</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>With hacked DeepStream and no model changes at all this pipeline now hits 350 FPS when measured with no tracing overhead. This is up from 110 FPS with regular DeepStream. I think we deserve a chart:</p>








<p>The <code>Concurrency 1x2080Ti</code> stage from the Python pipeline is now the closest comparison both in terms of FPS and optimizations applied. Both pipelines have batched inference, video frames decoded and processed on GPU end-to-end, and concurrency at the batch level (note the overlapping NVTX ranges below). One additional level of concurrency in the Python pipeline is multiple overlapping CUDA streams.</p>
<p>The Nsight Systems view shows processing for several 16-frame batches:</p>

</a>

<p>We now have good GPU utilization and very few needless memory transfers, so the path forward is to optimize the TorchScript model. Until now the TensorRT component has been entirely pass-through and everything from preprocessing, inference and postprocessing has been in TorchScript.</p>
<p>It’s time to start using the TensorRT optimizer, so get ready for some excitement.</p>

<p>According to Nvidia, TensorRT <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">“dramatically accelerates deep learning inference performance”</a> so why not compile 100% of our model with TensorRT?</p>
<p>The Pytorch export to TensorRT consists of a couple of steps, and both provide an opportunity for incomplete support:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the Pytorch model to the <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> interchange representation via <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#tracing-vs-scripting">tracing or scripting</a>.</li>
<li>Compile the ONNX representation into a TensorRT engine, the optimized form of the model.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you try to create an optimized TensorRT engine for this entire model (SSD300 including postprocessing), the first problem you will run into is the export to ONNX of the …</p></article></div>

			<p>This is a technical write up of the author’s investigation on how users of Samsung phones in Hong Kong (and Macau), using firmware released in September 2020, would be forced to use a public DNS service in Mainland China, which caused unease and privacy concerns among some of its users.</p>
<p>While this was investigated on a variant of a Galaxy Note 10+ phone targetting the Hong Kong market, it was reported that the issue exists for a wide range of recent Samsung phones, including those sold in other places when used in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Update: The firmware update released in Mid-October 2020 has fixed the DNS issue discussed in this Part, but the issue of DNS queries for <code>qq.com</code> discussed in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/15/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users-2/">Part 2</a> remained unchanged.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Shameless plug (for Hong Kong users): The author is the developer of Headuck Call blocker (useful only in Hong Kong). Earlier it got mistakenly flagged as malware by Google and lost many of its users, but the appeal was successful and the App is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headuck.headuckblocker.dev">on Google Play</a> again. Please re-consider the App if you got scared by the earlier Google Play malware warning.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In early October 2020, a Samsung phone user in Hong Kong, local forum (HKEPC) user dingwinslow209, <a href="https://www.hkepc.com/forum/viewthread.php?fid=168&amp;tid=2586830">reported that (link to forum post in Chinese)</a> an extra DNS server entry, <code>114.114.114.114</code> was added to the DNS setting of his Samsung mobile phone, which was updated with the latest firmware, whenever he was using a WiFi connection.&nbsp; This happened both when the DNS setting is static, or dynamic using DHCP (but not when VPN / mobile network was used).&nbsp; Even when both DNS1 and DNS2 were set to valid DNS servers (e.g. Google public DNS service using <code>DNS1 = 8.8.8.8</code> and <code>DNS2 = 8.8.4.4</code>), a new DNS3 entry pointing to <code>114.114.114.114</code> would appear in some utility app.</p>
<p>This immediately raised privacy concerns among some Samsung users in Hong Kong, as the public DNS server <code>114.114.114.114</code> is owned by Cogent Communications, under <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/114.114.114.114">Nanjing XinFeng Information Technologies Inc</a>, in Mainland China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in another local forum (lihkg), users captured DNS requests to <code>114.114.114.114</code>, and observed queries for “<code>qq.com</code>”&nbsp; (domain owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent), even when no software from Tencent is installed in the devices.&nbsp; There were reports that these DNS queries were sent once per minute, so long as the phone screen remained on.</p>
<p>There are further reports that when DNS queries to qq.com were blocked, the phone would report no internet connectivity via the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>The observation of the extra DNS entry was later independently confirmed by other forum users and the local media, using recent Samsung phones which have been updated in recent months.&nbsp; (See the links in the HKPEC post above, in Chinese).&nbsp; The issue persisted even when users reset their Samsung phone to factory settings. This showed that the issue originates from Samsung firmware instead of some third-party software malware.</p>
<p>The following documents the technical investigation and verification of the issue directly from analysing the code from firmware.&nbsp; The information should be sufficient for the issue and its extent to be independently verified.</p>
<h3>Getting and extracting the firmware</h3>
<p>To confirm the issue, a recent Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ firmware (SM-N9750 TGY, Hong Kong version), at Security Patch level 2020-09-01 was downloaded from one of the Samsung firmware download sites. Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the Samsung models reportedly&nbsp;affected.</p>
<p>After unzipping the downloaded firmware (in zip format), expanding the tar file beginning with “<code>AP_N9750ZSU3CTH1</code>“, decompressing the file <code>system.img.ext4.lz4</code> using <code>lz4</code>, converting it to ext4 format using <code>simg2img</code>, and mounting it as ext4 volume under Linux, one has access to the system image which would be installed when Note 10+ users update their phone to that patch level. (The same is accessible if a Note 10+ phone is rooted).</p>
<p>After some research, the culprit was found – a vendor specific service level component, added by Samsung to the Android framework, located at <code>/system/framework/wifi-service.jar</code>. This seems to work at the android system service level, supplementing the usual <code>services.jar</code>.</p>
<p>The decompiled source of the jar file (using <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this site</a>, with Jadx decompiler) has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY">https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY</a>.&nbsp; The following is a walkthrough of the relevant code when a user connects to a WiFi network, showing how the DNS entries were modified.</p>
<h3>Relevant flow of DNS entry addition</h3>
<p>The main culprit is the class <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, located in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>. The decompiled code contains the following:</p>
<p>line 129: the hardcoded address <code>114.114.114.114</code></p>
<pre>private static final String CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP = "114.114.114.114";</pre>
<p>line 878: addresses used for DNS probe (to be covered in next part).</p>
<pre>public final String DEFAULT_URL = "http://www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_CHINA = "http://www.qq.com";
public String DEFAULT_URL_STRING = "www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_STRING_CHINA = "www.qq.com";</pre>
<p>This large class is mainly a state machine of the various WiFi states. The state hierarchy are defined, and initial state set, at lines 1185-1197.</p>
<pre>addState(this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mNotConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mCaptivePortalState, this.mConnectedState);
addState(this.mEvaluatedState, this.mConnectedState);
....
setInitialState(this.mNotConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The base class for the StateMachine can be found under AOSP source (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/util/StateMachine.java?q=StateMachine.java&amp;ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject">StateMachine.java</a>).</p>
<p>When the device is connected to WiFi, it would enter <code>ConnectedState</code>.</p>
<p>line 1976 (under <code>processMessage()</code> of the initial <code>NotConnectedState</code>) would be invoked when a new WiFi connection is detected.</p>
<pre>wifiConnectivityMonitor.transitionTo(wifiConnectivityMonitor.mConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The <code>mConnectedState</code> variable is of class <code>ConnectedState</code>, defined from line 1988. The <code>enter()</code> method of <code>ConnectedState</code> contains the following code (from line 2090), which uses <code>CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP</code> (i.e. the Mainland Chinese controlled DNS server):</p>
<pre>if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager != null &amp;&amp; WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
    Message msg = new Message();
    msg.what = 330;
    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putString("publicDnsServer", WifiConnectivityMonitor.CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP);
    msg.obj = args;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager.callSECApi(msg);
}
</pre>
<p>From the code it seems to add the Mainland Chinese DNS service to the user’s list of DNS server automatically, when the device is connected to Chinese mobile network. There seems no option to disable the behaviour.</p>
<p><code>WifiConnectivityMonitor.inChinaNetwork()</code> is at line 11199.&nbsp; As suggested by its name, it should obtain the ISO code and return true only if the device is connected to a mobile network in China:</p>
<pre>public boolean inChinaNetwork() {
    String str = this.mCountryIso;
    if (str == null || str.length() != 2) {
        updateCountryIsoCode();
    }
    if (!isChineseIso(this.mCountryIso)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!DBG) {
        return true;
    }
    Log.d(TAG, "Need to skip captive portal check. CISO: " + this.mCountryIso);
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Digging deeper, this is how the ISO code (<code>mCountryIso</code>) is obtained, under <code>updateCountryIsoCode()</code> at line 11219 (fallback skipped).</p>
<pre>public void updateCountryIsoCode() {
    if (this.mTelephonyManager == null) {
        try {
            this.mTelephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) this.mContext.getSystemService("phone");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Exception occured at updateCountryIsoCode(), while retrieving Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE");
        }
    }
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = this.mTelephonyManager;
    if (telephonyManager != null) {
        this.mCountryIso = telephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso();
        Log.i(TAG, "updateCountryIsoCode() via TelephonyManager : mCountryIso: " + this.mCountryIso);
    }
    /* fallback when there is no mobile network skipped. The fallback is to read the CountryISO setting from a Samsung config file (cscfeature.xml) */
    ....
}
</pre>
<p>(While not shown here, this code is also invoked when initializing and when change in ISO code of telephone network is detected, so it need not be called during each check.) The country code is get from <code>TelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso()</code> which is a standard Android API, documented <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getNetworkCountryIso()">here</a>. It returns the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code equivalent of the MCC (Mobile Country Code) of the mobile operator. In Hong Kong, this is “HK”, and in Mainland China this is “CN”.</p>
<p>As one might suspect at this point, the problem lies in <code>isChineseIso()</code>, at line 11214:</p>
<pre>private boolean isChineseIso(String countryIso) {
    return "cn".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "hk".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "mo".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso);
}</pre>
<p>This means that you are treated as being connected to a Chinese mobile network if you are connected to a Hong Kong mobile network for the purpose of adding the 114 DNS service.&nbsp; (BTW, “MO” is the ISO-3166-1 code for Macau.) Perhaps Samsung might want to address cases when people travel to Mainland China while forgetting to reset their hardcoded DNS settings, and kindly “add” a DNS service which works within the Great Firewall of China. But they seemed to forget that both Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall, at least so far.</p>
<p>Back to the DNS setting code above (line 2090). It makes a binder call to <code>WifiManager.callSECApi()</code>, with message code = 330, with a <code>Bundle</code> setting <code>publicDnsServer</code> to our friend <code>114.114.114.114</code>. While <code>WifiManager</code> is a standard Android class the method <code>callSECApi()</code>, as suggested by its name, is Samsung specific.</p>
<p>The remote call to <code>WifiManager</code> would end up in the service class implementation at <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiServiceImpl</code>, implementing WifiService, at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiServiceImpl.java">WifiServiceImpl.java</a>. (The class is Samsung’s extension to the AOSP service class of the same …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Twice a day, we peak in intellectual performance. We can improve our productivity by understanding the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></p>
<h3><span id="Circadian_graph_and_brainwork">Circadian graph and brainwork</span></h3>
<p>Charting the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> makes it possible to find the best windows of time for brainwork. The <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> graph below was generated with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> using a log of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a>. In the graph, two yellow bands indicate the optimum time for brainwork. The exact timing may differ for each individual. However, the blocks can be easily determined:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Morning block</b>: soon after waking, after morning coffee, or after breakfast. The best brain slot may last 2-4 hours. If you are sleepy in the morning see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">Natural creativity cycle</a></li>
<li> <b>Evening block</b>: soon after <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. The second best brain slot may last 2-4 hours as well. If you do not nap, you may not fully benefit from that block (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Power_nap" title="Power nap">Power nap</a>). If you are sleepy during this slot see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping" title="Best time for napping">Best time for napping</a></li></ol>
<p>The graph explains the reasons for which the two brainwork blocks emerge:

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> <b>Optimizing the timing of brainwork with respect to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></b>. This graph was generated with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> on the basis of 3-year-long daily measurements of a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> rhythm. The horizontal axis expresses the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_phase" title="Circadian phase">number of hours from awakening</a> (note that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> cycle period may be longer than 24 hours). <span>Light blue dots</span> are actual sleep episode measurements with timing on the horizontal, and the length on the left vertical axis. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">Homeostatic</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as the <b>ability to initiate sleep</b>. Percent of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>blue line</span> (right-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Adenosine-related <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic_sleep_propensity" title="Homeostatic sleep propensity">homeostatic sleep propensity</a> increases in proportion to mental effort and can be partially cleared by caffeine, stress, etc. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">Circadian</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as <b>the ability to maintain sleep</b>. Average length of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>red line</span> (left-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Mid-day slump in alertness is also circadian, but is biologically different and results in short sleep that does not register as a red peak. <b>Sleep maintenance</b> circadian component correlates (1) negatively with core body temperature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine">catecholamines</a>, and (2) positively with: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Melatonin" title="Melatonin">melatonin</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/REM_sleep" title="REM sleep">REM sleep</a> propensity. <b>Optimum timing of brainwork</b> requires both (1) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> sleepiness, and (2) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleepiness. There are two high quality alertness blocks during the day: the first after the awakening, and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. Both blocks are marked as <span>yellow</span> bands below the graph. For best learning, and for best <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>, use these two <span>yellow blocks</span> of time. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Caffeine" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a> can only be used to enhance alertness early in the optimum brainwork window (<span>brown</span>). Later use will affect sleep (caffeine half-life is about six hours). Optimum timing of exercise is not marked as it may vary depending on the optimum timing of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Zeitgeber" title="Zeitgeber">zeitgebers</a> (e.g. early morning for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> people and evening for ASPS people).

<h3><span id="Best_brainwork_time">Best brainwork time</span></h3>
<p>The optimum timing of brainwork requires both high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> alertness and high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> alertness. There are two quality alertness blocks during the day: the first occurs after awakening and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a> period. Both are marked as <span>yellow blocks</span> in the graph (above). For best learning and best creative results, use these yellow blocks for brainwork. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine" title="Factors that affect sleep"><span>Caffeine</span></a> can only be used to enhance alertness early in this optimum window. Later use will affect sleep (the half-life of caffeine is about six hours). The optimum timing of exercise may vary depending on your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Exercise" title="Factors that affect sleep">exercise</a> goals and the optimum timing of zeitgebers (e.g. early morning for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> people and evening for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> people). In this example, the <span>stress block</span> is followed by the <span>exercise block</span> to counterbalance the hormonal and neural effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a> before the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_valve" title="Stress valve">Stress valves</a>). Unmarked white areas can be used for the lunch (before siesta) and fun time unrelated to work in the evening at a time when the ascending <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleepiness makes creative work ineffective. That white evening protective zone should be free from stress, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Alcohol" title="Factors that affect sleep">alcohol</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine" title="Factors that affect sleep">caffeine</a>, etc. Recommended activities might include fun games, relaxation, TV, reading, family-time, DIY, housework, etc. For inveterate workaholics, less challenging and stress-free jobs might also work ok. 
</p>
<p><b>The best test for a well designed day is that all activities <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning" title="Pleasure of learning">should be fun</a>!</b></p> 
<p>Brainwork is fun only if your brain is ready. Sleep is fun if you are ready. Rest and entertainment feel right only after a productive day. Even a bit of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> can be fun if it is properly dosed and timed. You do not need to be an adrenaline junkie to enjoy your stress and exercise slots. There is little exaggeration in saying that <b>a good understanding of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> is the key to a happy and productive day!</b> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_happy_life" title="Formula for happy life">Formula for happy life</a>).
</p>
<p>Happy and productive life is best achieved by adhering to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></p>
<h3><span id="Natural_creativity_cycle">Natural creativity cycle</span></h3>
<p>In addition to the variables of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a>, the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a> employs the fact that the neocortex operates in several modes determined by local fatigue, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creative meandering</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. During the day, natural transitions from high focus to distraction, to high creativity, and to rest will occur in proportion to the engagement of individual areas of the cortex. It will depend on the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_map" title="Concept map">concept maps</a> involved in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mental_computation" title="Mental computation">mental computation</a>, and the overall neural activation. At night, the brain will proceed with natural <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization" title="Memory optimization">memory optimization</a> by sequentially switching between <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/NREM" title="NREM">NREM</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/REM" title="REM">REM</a> sleep modes.
</p>
<p>All brainwork should be based on self-regulation and natural transitions to high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a> and/or rest. All forms of artificial control will increase the fatigue and reduce the productivity</p>

<h3><span id="Balanced_24_hour_cycle">Balanced 24 hour cycle</span></h3>
<p>The <span>slanting green line</span> separates the graph into the areas of phase advanced (right) and phase delays (left). The line is determined by points in the graph where the waking time (horizontal axis) added to the sleep time (left vertical axis) equals to 24.0 hours. The place where the <span>green breakeven line</span> crosses the <span>red sleep length line</span> determines the optimum balanced sleep cycle of 24 hours. In the presented example, 17.35 hours of waking, added to the expected 6.65 hours of sleep time complete a balanced full 24 hours sleep-wake cycle. The greater the angle between the <span>green</span> and <span>red</span> lines, the harder it is to balance sleep and fit it into the 24h cycle of the rotating earth. In the example, adding waking hours does not shorten sleep much enough to make the balance easy. This implies that a religious adherence to a 17.35 day may be necessary to balance the cycle. However, this shortened waking day may increase <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_latency" title="Sleep latency">sleep latency</a> and increase the probability of premature awakening, which can also tip the balance towards the phase delay. The <span>vertical aqua line</span> shows where the expected sleep time added to the waking time equals to 24 hours (crossover with the <span>green line</span> representing a perfect 24-hour day). In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> or <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> that 24h balance may be hard to accomplish. For example, without medical intervention, only a large protective zone in the evening, early nap (or no nap), and intense morning exercise can help balance the day in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a>.
</p><p><b>Important!</b> This graph is based on data that is true solely for a free running sleep condition. If you use an alarm clock to regulate the timing of your sleep, these measurements and recommendations may not apply! In addition, the timing and amplitude of changes differ vastly between individuals!
</p>
<h2><span id="Sleeping_against_your_natural_rhythm">Sleeping against your natural rhythm</span></h2>
<p>If you sleep against your natural rhythm you will often experience tiredness or drowsiness that can be resolved by adjusting the sleeping hours. In healthy individuals, the daytime alertness is primarily determined by:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_sleep" title="Two components of sleep">circadian phase and homeostatic sleepiness</a></li>
<li> total sleep time the night before</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#NREM_and_memory" title="Memory optimization in sleep">amount of slow-wave sleep the night before</a></li>
<li> regular adherence to the sleep-wake schedule in preceding days</li>
<li> sleep deficits accumulated in the preceding days (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#REM_rebound_hypothesis" title="How do we fall asleep?">REM deficit</a>, SWA deficit, etc.)</li></ol>
<p>All those factors are closely associated with the sleep phase. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep" title="Formula for good sleep: free running sleep">Free running sleep</a> provides the best way to maximize alertness throughout a waking day. Free running sleep is likely to shift the minimum temperature point from the early morning closer towards the middle of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subjective_night" title="Subjective night">subjective night</a>. You should notice <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">increased sleepiness before going to sleep</a> and no <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_inertia" title="Sleep inertia">sleep inertia</a> upon awakening! If you cannot free-run your sleep, it is very important to understand the relationship between your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleep drives as compiled in the table below. In the course of the day, you should move in sync between the yellow areas of the table, i.e. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#Sleep-wake_flip-flop" title="How do we fall asleep?">from perfect alertness to maximum sleepiness, and then back to perfect alertness</a>. The gray areas illustrate when your sleep falls out of sync:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>High circadian sleepiness
</td>
<td>Low circadian sleepiness
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>High homeostatic sleepiness
</td>
<td><b>Peak of the night</b>: You are very drowsy and fall into refreshing sleep with latency of less than five minutes
</td>
<td><b>Insomnia</b>: You are tossing and turning in bed. You are very tired but you cannot fall asleep. Your temperature, blood pressure and pulse are raised. Your thoughts are racing
<p><b>Solution</b>: Wait for the arrival of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> phase. Delay going to sleep by 3-6 hours
</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody><caption>
</caption>
<tbody><tr><td>Low homeostatic sleepiness
</td>
<td><b>Hypersomnia</b>: You are drowsy throughout the day despite long sleep hours. Napping does not help. You show minimum energy levels. Your muscles are weak and atonic
<p><b>Solution</b>: Adjust your sleep phase to your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> (e.g. try to go to sleep 3-6 hours later)
</p>
</td>
<td><b>Peak of the day</b>: You are alert, energetic, and full of new ideas

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>Where we are</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">published an article in CoinDesk</a> about using crypto to secure our elections. You can read and discuss more on this forum in <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/can-crypto-save-our-elections/885">part 1</a> and <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/how-to-safeguard-elections-with-crypto/886">part 2</a> that go into some detail about how crypto-powered voting would work, and why it would solve many problems that we face today.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Intercoin started building <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/c/applications/14">applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform</a>. While it’s not scalable enough to power <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/crypto-not-scalable-enough-to-be-money-cointelegraph">everyday money</a> or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/ethereum-scalability-viability">massive elections</a>, perhaps Ethereum 2.0 (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-comprehensive-view-of-ethereum-2-0-serenity-5865ad8b7c62">Serenity</a>) will one day become scalable enough that these smart contracts can see wider adoption, even without having to migrate to the Intercoin back-end platform.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Intercoin is planning to release its own Intercoin App in the app stores, and turn <a href="http://intercoin.org/">intercoin.org</a> into a web-based portal that will let anyone with a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Chrome Extension</a> to deploy the smart contracts we developed, invite friends from their contact list, and manage their community together. We also plan to roll out the Intercoin Crypto Show to teach people more about crypto and smart contracts. In the meantime, if you have questions, feel free to ask them in this forum.</p>
<p><strong>Start of the Art in Crypto Voting</strong></p>
<p>For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology. There have been early experiments in Russia running elections on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moscows-blockchain-voting-system-cracked-a-month-before-election/">Ethereum</a> as well as proprietary platforms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/russia-vote-blockchain">Waves</a>. It’s still early, but we will see tremendous growth in the coming years.</p>
<p>What if people could vote securely online? Then they would be able to make decisions collectively about a variety of things. Technology can lower the cost of running a secure election, and make it available to any organization, large or small. But who can vote, and when? How do we know that it will be secure? Below, we explore exactly these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Vote?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in democratic elections is determining who can vote, and ensuring that everyone has an equal amount of say. There needs to be some process in place to make sure people don’t create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack#:~:text=In%20a%20Sybil%20attack%2C%20the,diagnosed%20with%20dissociative%20identity%20disorder.">multiple identities</a> to cheat the system. This is accomplished by voter registration, which itself has controversial issues like purging <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-rights/-use-it-or-lose-it---the-problem-of-purges-from-the-registration0/">inactive voters</a> and <a>disadvantaged voters</a> and other ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States#Disparate_impact">disenfranchising voters</a> from even having their voice heard in the election.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will come up with better solutions for voter registration, but – for now – this step will have to be done via some established process that a community has. We have deployed the <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">CommunityContract</a> specifically to give communities the ability to determine who can vote, and who can’t.</p>
<p><strong>When Can They Vote?</strong></p>
<p>In the USA, voting normally takes place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)">Election Day</a>, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Some states allow early voting, so people can cast ballots before Election Day.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=212">how polling is better than elections</a>. What I meant is that, expecting the entire population to turn out for an election on a specific day will lead to problems with voter turnout. Having a referendum where only 20% of people vote can cast doubt on the legitimacy of whether the outcome faithfully represents the will of the overall population, or just those who bothered to show up. For example, Puerto Rico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum#:~:text=A%20referendum%20on%20the%20political,overwhelmingly%20chose%20statehood%20by%2097%25.">voted in 2017 to join the United States</a> by an overwhelming 97%, but that is partly due to a boycott by the opposition, who didn’t show up to vote, resulting in a 22.93% turnout. Opinion polls, on the other hand, show 52% support for joining the United States – a majority to be sure, but nowhere near as overwhelming, and possibly within a margin of error.</p>
<p>Polling vs Elections is less about who can vote, but rather about <em>when</em>. You can have a poll take place over a 5 year period, and in any given window of time, a certain small, random representative sample is able to vote. Any given participant can vote at most once in that rolling window, before it moves on to others. Participants can also fail to cast a vote, which is similar to sitting out an election, but at least timing of the eligibility window would be randomized for everyone, and can be lengthened to several days, removing major impediments to voting. Of course, all these parameters are customizable, and letting 100% of the people vote 100% of the time throughout the poll is just like a regular election.</p>
<p>People without a phone or active notifications would be underrepresented, but presumably, those who opted into elections and polls conducted with digital technology, especially about smart contract issues, would take care to have them turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting Voters</strong></p>
<p>Each block in Ethereum has a hash of all transactions it contains, and it is pretty much impossible to control this hash without controlling a majority of mining power on the network. Moreover, controlling this hash would only allow one to possibly control the outcome of a tiny window in a single given election. A lot of effort resulting in almost no vandalism.</p>
<p>It is possible for smart contracts to use the <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11455/inside-a-smart-contract-is-it-possible-to-get-latest-mined-blocks-number-and-i">hashes from previously mined blocks</a> as a “random” seed (better to call “uncontrolled” seed). Based on this seed, we can select <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">members of the voting community</a> who are eligible to vote in any given block, by calling:</p>
<pre>eligible(address, blockNumber)
</pre>
<p>Blocks can go by pretty fast, and someone eligible to vote in block M could be eligible to vote in blocks M+1, M+2, …, M+N. Actually, rather than base it on block number, we use <em>timestamps</em>. That’s because we can’t rely on how quickly blocks will be mined, especially <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/200/19734">after Ethereum Serenity 2.0 rolls out</a>. Timestamps may sometimes be off by 2 hours or so (if miners are malicious) but this shouldn’t seriously affect the window in a biased way if we’re talking about random samples and polling windows that last several days.</p>
<p>Periodically, the Intercoin app (or another dapp) running on one or more servers somewhere can watch the <code>VotingContract</code> on the blockchain and find out if the user has recently become eligible to vote in the poll. It then sends a notification, sms or email to the user, with a link to the poll. Upon receiving it, the user would typically have a bunch of time to visit the link and cast their vote. Rather than having the smart contract waste gas looping through a ton of previous block hashes and execute the <code>eligible()</code> function, the client dapp interface helpfully submits the <code>blockNumber</code> together with the vote. The smart contract them simply verifies the eligibility before allowing the vote to proceed.</p>
<p>The <code>eligible()</code> function takes into account <code>blockNumber</code>, but also the <code>memberCount</code> from <code>CommunityContract</code> and <code>fraction</code> of them that can vote in any given window. The <code>eligible()</code> function must be continuous in the latter two variables, since e.g. <code>memberCount</code> of a community can change between the time the user learns they can vote, and then when their transaction is finally mined.</p>
<p><strong>What Can They Vote For?</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>VotingContract</code> is designed to be a general-purpose smart contract, to work with many types of elections, referendums, and polls. Those who are eligible to vote will call:</p>
<pre><code>contract VotingContract {
   address externalContract;
   address externalMethod;
   uint fraction; // eligible people to vote in any given window, out of 1e10
   uint minimum; // minimum number of eligible people in any window

   function vote(VotingData data, uint eligibleBlock) {
     if (eligible(msg.sender)
     &amp;&amp; !hasVotedSince(msg.sender, eligibleBlock)) {
        // valid vote as far as eligibility and voting once
        // but external contract might roll back this transaction
        // if the vote contains invalid data, for instance
        externalContract.call(
          abi.encodeWithSignature(
             concat(externalMethod, "(uint256,uint256)"), 
             data
          )
        );
     }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>VotingData</code> is a <code>struct</code> that can contain arbitrary properties, which are interpreted by the <code>externalMethod</code> of the <code>externalContract</code>, which may choose to <code>rollback()</code> the transaction. It is not the business of <code>VotingContract</code> about <em><strong>how</strong></em> the vote is interpreted. It may be tallied in various ways (First past the post, <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-versus-irv/">ranked choice, approval vote</a>) and it may be a vote among two or more candidates (although for more than two, keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</a>). For example, the <code>IncomeContract</code> can use the <code>VotingContract</code> and <code>CommunityContract</code> to allow a community to vote on whether the level of UBI should go up or down by 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The set of threat profiles for an election or poll differs from, say, a banking app. Although both require security, in the banking app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are managing relatively large amounts of money which are dear to them, and therefore take care to make sure their transaction was properly executed</li>
<li>people use the app that the bank releases, cryptographically signs and distributes on the app store or the web through https</li>
<li>people trust the bank and the bank is prepared to reverse individual transactions through chargebacks and fraud investigations</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, with a voting app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are casting one vote in a sea of votes, and it won’t harm them much if only their transaction was executed incorrectly, so most won’t check</li>
<li>if everyone used a particular app to cast their vote, the creator of the app could be compromised, and no one voter would be incentivized to check</li>
<li>people trust a system consisting of multiple actors, which is not prepared to let only some people recast their votes and not others</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of 1 and 2 with voting means that most people won’t bother to check that their vote was properly recorded, and even if they do, they won’t know about everyone else whose vote may have been recorded incorrectly. A malicious actor could create a voting app that a large portion of the community ends up using, and this voting app might <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV_c1-YTk8M">switch the …</a></p></div></div>

Experienced Python developers might recognize some of them. However, others will still be unknown. Regardless, I find all of them very cool.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="yc4ulma"><code>...</code></h2>
<p>Yes, you’re reading it right, <code>...</code> is a valid construct in Python. <code>...</code> is a singleton object called <code>Ellipsis</code>. If you type it into the Python interpreter, you can actually see it:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>...
<span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">official docs</a> , <code>Ellipsis</code> is a "special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.". There’s two major use cases for it. One is to serve as a placeholder body in an empty function. The other is on <code>Numpy</code>, as a slice item, just as described in the docs.</p>
<h3 id="function-placeholder">Function Placeholder</h3>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Beware, I'm not saying that <code>pass</code> == <code>...</code>, I'm just saying that as a function body, the outcome is the same. In fact, you can use anything as placeholder.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>"An empty, but also awesome function"</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="numpy">Numpy</h3>

<h2 id="an-elegant-unpacking">An Elegant Unpacking</h2>
<p>Iterable unpacking is a remarkably convenient feature and has been there for a while. Most people use it to unpack iterables with multiple items. As example, consider the following use cases.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, *b, c = range(<span>1</span>, <span>11</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
[<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Or just:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, b, c = range(<span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>2</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But one nice use case that many people do not take advantage of is unpacking a single iterable. Why this is useful? It makes the code a little bit more elegant, IMHO.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = lst[<span>0</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>(a, ) = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>[a] = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I know that it may seem silly, but at least to me, it looks more elegant.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-flat-this-list">Can You Flat This List?</h2>
<p>Flattening a list can be done in several ways. The simplest one is using list comprehension. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>], [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened = [elem <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> l <span>for</span> elem <span>in</span> sublist]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're more inclined to functional programming, you can use a reducer.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> reduce
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>reduce(<span>lambda</span> x,y: x+y,l)
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>However, there's yet another way. You can use the <code>sum</code> function!</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, [])
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>This works because the <code>sum</code> function iterates through each element in the list and concatenates them with the default value you pass as the second argument. Since lists in Python can be concatenated with <code>+</code> operator, then you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, []) ==&gt; [] + [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>] + [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>] + [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Even though this trick is brilliant, it’s by no means readable. Also, it has a terrible performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we do this with string?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Python forbids doing the same with strings, even though you can concatenated strings with <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = [<span>"abc"</span>, <span>"def"</span>, <span>"ghf"</span>]

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(s, <span>""</span>)

<h2 id="the">The <code>_</code></h2>
<p>This one is really interesting and very handy when working with the REPL. It not only works with the default Python interpreter, but with IPython as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you run an expression in the REPL, Python binds the output to the <code>_</code> variable. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>nums = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>7</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(nums)
<span>11</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>_
<span>11</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>_</code> is a variable like any other, you can re-bind it, or do anything else with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>9</span> + _
<span>20</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = _
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>20</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-else">What <code>else</code>?</h2>
<p>The <code>else</code> statement in can serve several purposes. Few people know, but you can use it outside the classical ‘if else` block. Python allow it to be used on loops and also on exception blocks.</p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>Python has two different loops, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>. Both of them can be "broken". That is, if a certain condition is met, we can break out of the loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>7</span>]: <span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
   ...:     <span>if</span> a == <span>3</span>:
   ...:         print(<span>"a == 3. exiting loop."</span>)
   ...:         <span>break</span>
   ...:     a += <span>1</span>
   ...: 
a == <span>3.</span> exiting loop.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's say that we are looking for a particular condition. If that condition is satisfied, we save the result in a flag called <code>found</code>. Then, if we don't find it, we print a message.</p>
<pre><code>found = <span>False</span>
a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        found = <span>True</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> found:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>a</code> never becomes 12, the program outputs <code>a was never found</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, but how can we use <code>else</code> in this context?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>else</code> can be used to replace the flag. Basically, what we actually want is to run the loop and, if not found, then print a message. This is how it looks like with <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And since it works with any loop, you can use a <code>for</code> instead of <code>while</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> a <span>in</span> range(<span>10</span>):
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>The <code>else</code> in Python is so versatile that you can even use it in a <code>try ... except</code> block. The idea here is to capture a nonoccurrence of an exception. </p>
<pre><code>In [<span>13</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Key <span>is</span> missing
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we try looking up a key named “lala” in an empty dictionary. Since “lala” is not there, the code will raise an <code>KeyError</code> exception. When I run this snippet in <code>IPython</code>, I got an expected result.</p>
<p>What about a case where the program raises no exception?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>14</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {<span>'lala'</span>: <span>'bla'</span>}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Else here
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see it in action. The <code>{’lala’: ‘bla’}[‘lala’]</code> block won’t raise <code>KeyError</code>, so the <code>else</code> comes into play. </p>
<p>Remember, few people know this, so I personally avoid using this feature to not confuse other developers working in the same code base. It’s nice to impress friends, though!</p>
<h2 id="comparing-things-like-a-boss">Comparing Things Like a Boss</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorites and not so hidden, to be honest. Unlike many programming languages, like <code>Java</code>, <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>, Python allows you to chain comparison operators. Let's imagine that you have a variable <code>x</code> that holds the value of <code>10</code>. Now, let's say that you want to assert that <code>x</code> is within a range, like 5..20, inclusive. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>16</span>]: x = <span>10</span>
In [<span>17</span>]: <span>if</span> x &gt;= <span>5</span> <span>and</span> x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out, this can be simplified by chaining the operators. So, we can refactor the code to this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>18</span>]: <span>if</span> <span>5</span> &lt;= x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>This code achieves the exact same result, but it's much more elegant. You can chain using any kind of comparison operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x &gt; <span>1</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x &lt; <span>20</span> &lt; x*<span>10</span> &lt; <span>1000</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Very cool!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s the end of this post. Python is a very friendly language and has some nice, but not well-known, features. In this post, I showed you my favorites and I hope you’ve learned something new. See you next time!</p>

  <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

  <p>An encouraging development in the education of programmers in recent years has been a renewed interest in the relationship between programming, logic and abstract algebra. Recent enthusiasm over functional programming is no doubt the main motivation behind this happy development.</p>

  <p>However, this interest is at times accompanied by a kind of awed appreciation of this relationship, perhaps among practitioner enthusiasts, who consider it almost miraculous, more than among academics. Some researchers notable for popularizing the interest in this relationship encourage this view with talk of “computational trinitarianism” and statements like, “this is further proof that mathematics is discovered rather than invented,” one <a href="http://archive.is/3wgAM">going so far</a> as to call the relationship “a manifestation of the divine” and to say that “all three have ontological force; they codify what is, not how to describe what is already given to us. In this sense they are foundational; if we suppose that they are merely <em>descriptive</em>, we would be left with the question of where these previously given concepts arise, leading us back again to foundations”. Another has <a href="https://vimeo.com/242784236">said</a>,<sup id="fnref:milewski"><a href="#fn:milewski">1</a></sup> “Have you heard of the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism? … These three different theories … were developed separately — constructive logic, typed lambda calculus, and category theory — and the isomorphism says that these are actually <em>identical</em>. Why do these three completely separate theories have the same structure? Because all three of them are about composability.” While he is not too far off the mark when he later says, “Maybe we are just discovering the way our brains work. … [I]f mathematics is all about composition, then composition is something that our brains came up with in order to deal with complexity,” the truth is far simpler yet more interesting, even if less mysterious.</p>

  <p>Awed wonder is a powerful marketing tool, but it mystifies rather than clarifies, and fosters a kind of magical thinking in a field that strives to be most at odds with it (although, as we’ll see in part 2, it sometimes fails). The goal of mathematics is to simplify, not to wow. This attitude towards that — quite obvious, as we’ll see — relationship also distracts from the actual, less obvious, discoveries made. The existence of this relationship was not among them; it was not the denouement — it was the setup. Confusing the two muddles the very essence of any story.</p>

  <p>I also believe that it is this very attitude that puts the focus on the chosen mathematical abstractions rather than on the things they describe creates an atmosphere where there can only be one True interpretation — even one with three personas. I call this absolutist view that confuses the peculiarities of a method of observation with those of the observed system and so denies alternative interpretations the “Protestant” view, and it is a hindrance to understanding logic, where truth is, almost by definition, always relative to a specific system. As Alonzo Church wrote in the very paper he first introduced the λ-calculus<sup id="fnref:church0"><a href="#fn:church0">2</a></sup>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We do not attach any character of uniqueness or absolute truth to any particular system of logic. The entities of formal logic are abstractions, invented because of their use in describing and systematizing facts of experience or observation, and their properties, determined in rough outline by this intended use, depend for their exact character on the arbitrary choice of the inventor… [T]here exist, undoubtedly, more than one formal system whose use as a logic is feasible, and of these systems one may be more pleasing or more convenient than another, but it cannot be said that one is right and the other wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following text will attempt to demistify this relationship between computation, logic and abstract algebra. Category theory is a generalization of the last, but programming languages are sometimes interchangeably assigned to both the second, logic, and the first, computation, thus adding to the confusion. In my view, programming languages (at least when studied in a theoretical context) strictly belong to the second persona of logic, and not at all to the first, computation, other than by virtue of the ordinary relationship between the three; programming languages are no more related to computation than formal logic is. I <a href="https://pron.github.io/posts/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation">have previously written</a> about the distinction between programming and computation and the misunderstanding caused by confusing the two, and I hope that this text will clarify the matter further.</p>

  <p>While I will not opine on whether or not mathematical objects have “an ontological force”, as the Platonic ontology of mathematics is a matter of debate in the philosophy of mathematics — a fascinating field, but not a focus of this discussion — I will show that they are not only very much descriptive, but that <em>what</em> they attempt to describe, and therefore how they arise, has been explicitly stated by the originators of those ideas. There is nothing incidental, miraculous, surprising or “divine” in the relationship between computation, logic and algebra; rather, nothing is more creatively human than the process that led to their correlation, and while some things in mathematics are perhaps discovered, logic and algebra were <em>invented</em>, and rather than carrying an independent “foundational ontological force”, they were devised to <em>describe</em> a physical phenomenon (although I do not claim that the mathematical systems invented may not <em>also</em> correspond to some Truth). In particular, I will show that computation, logic and algebra were studied as a single subject for most of their relevant history, related in the following way: human reason works by computation, logic is a description of the process of reasoning, and algebra is the mathematical modeling of logic. The three began to separate into different disciplines only towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Logic was separated from algebra by Gottlob Frege, immediately triggering the criticism that the correspondence between the two is an argument for having only one. Frege responded that there would <em>obviously</em> be a correspondence between the two because he had invented one to describe the same thing as the other, but that one can translate between two modes of expression does not mean that one of them is redundant. Computation separated from logic some decades later as a more foundational or primitive concept, while exposing the fact that the basic principles of how logic supposedly described human reason — which Gottfried Leibniz called the “Art of Combination” — hadn’t changed for literally millennia, and while logicians/algebraists declared themselves to be studying the computation in the human mind, they were actually just modeling a very particular, and ancient, <em>view</em> of human reason that they had taken on unquestionable faith. The systems were in such harmonious correspondence not just because they described the same physical phenomenon, but because they all <em>re</em>-described the <em>same ancient description</em> of that phenomenon.</p>

  <p>While researching the topic — not being a logician or a historian, but rather a programmer and an amateur interested in the history of mathematics — I was surprised how explicit this connection was made from the very beginning of the disciplines. Quite the opposite of accidental or miraculous, calling this relationship obvious is an <em>understatement</em>. That there is some relationship between a house cat and a leopard can be said to be obvious; the one between the original Star Wars trilogy and its many prequels and sequels is much more than just obvious. If you think that it is in any way accidental or miraculous, or that it is proof that Darth Vader was discovered rather than invented, you are clearly missing something very important in understanding the meta-theory of stories — meaning, how they come to be. I delight at the opportunity to use the history of science — or of logic and mathematics in this case — to clarify the development of mathematical concepts by tracing their evolution and the creative process of their originators.</p>

  <p>This book-length text — and not a short book — is published as a three-part blog post series, but I personally wrote very little of it. While the text is not different in content or conclusions from books about the history of logic and computation (or the wonderful recent Atlantic article, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/"><em>How Aristotle Created the Computer</em></a>), it is certainly different in style, being comprised mostly of original sources. I chose to compose the text in this way for several reasons, listed here in no particular order: 1. I am not a professional historian and do not have sufficient knowledge to provide insight on historical trends. 2. I find reading (carefully selected) primary sources a lot more fun than sweeping descriptions. 3. As most mathematicians and programmers do not make good historians, a lot of inaccuracies and downright mistakes are perpetrated because few have seen the actual sources. 4. As my goal is to demystify logic and mathematics, I think it is especially enlightening to read how the originators of the ideas describe their process of arriving at their insight. My text is also different in focus; it attempts to emphasize the evolution of the connection …</p></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff1f1677bf36496f03d8"><div><p>As most of the major media categories — music, video and video games — have existed for decades, we tend to forget that media is technology. Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an <em>internet</em> <em>streaming </em>music service, while iTunes is a <em>download </em>music service, SiriusXM is <em>satellite</em> <em>broadcast</em> music service, and radio is a <em>terrestrial broadcast</em> technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “<span>outlets</span> or <span>tools</span> used to <span>store</span> and <span>deliver</span> information or data.”</p><p>While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change. </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: How Technology Created Recorded Media, Then Continually Redefined It</strong></p><p>Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602797899091_5458"><div><p>&nbsp;When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.&nbsp;</p><p>This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’ <em>Yesterday </em>and Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em> would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.&nbsp;</p><p>So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track, <em>Old Town Road </em>by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">accents</a>, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –&nbsp; afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/">hottest</a>” each week. According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, both groups had<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/"> reasons to lie</a>. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"> received bribes to play specific tracks</a>, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s <em>N***az4life</em> from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that <em>N***az4life</em> was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <h2>Fun with Combinators</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on October 17, 2020
</p>





<p>There are a bunch of “minimal” computational models out there: Turing machines, lambda calculus, PowerPoint <span data-cites="wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017">(Wildenhain <a href="#ref-wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, etc. These are radically simple languages which are nonetheless Turing complete, so theoretically “as powerful” as each other. Of those, lambda calculus is without question my favourite to actually write programs in: it’s the one which is closest to crawling out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpit</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, though, it is <em>far</em> from simple. Lambda calculus has <em>variables</em>, which introduce huge complexity into the interpreter: especially if you want to do any kind of formal reasoning about programs, this complexity is a problem. We might want to reach for something even lower-level than lambda calculus: this is where combinator calculi come in.</p>
<p>You may have heard of SKI combinator calculus: it’s the “simplest” of the calculi, but it’s not actually very easy to understand, and it’s absolute murder to try use. So we’re going to start with <code>BCKW</code>, a more obscure calculus, actually invented by Haskell Curry.</p>
<p>There are 4 combinators in <code>BCKW</code>: <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code> (shocking, I know). You can think about these combinators as functions which manipulate the beginning of strings:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Kxy  ~&gt; x
Wxy  ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>Let’s work with some examples to get a sense for how these combinators work.</p>
<p>Upper case letters are combinators, lower-case are variables. Yes, yes, I know I said that combinator calculi didn’t need variables, and it doesn’t! I’m just using them here to explain how each of the combinators work. If you really want to be pedantic you can think of the lower case letters as notational placeholders meaning “any given combinator”. They won’t exist in any actual programs we write.</p>
<p>The simplest combinator is <code>K</code>: it’s actually equivalent to the <code>const</code> function from Haskell. It discards its second argument, and returns the first. If you give a combinator more arguments than it usually accepts, you just keep the extra arguments in the output:</p>
<pre><code>Kxyz ~&gt; xz</code></pre>
<p><code>W</code> is the next combinator: it <em>duplicates</em> its second argument.</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>We always start from the <em>left</em>, applying the rule for the left-most combinator first.</p>
<pre><code>WKxyz ~&gt; Kxxyz ~&gt; xyz
KWxyz ~&gt; Wyz   ~&gt; yzz</code></pre>
<p>Next we have <code>C</code>: this is equivalent to the Haskell function <code>flip</code>. It swaps the second and third arguments:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a small little evaluator for expressions which use <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code>. You can edit the expression, and press enter to step through it.</p>



<p>The last combinator introduces parentheses, and it’s equivalent to function composition.</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)</code></pre>
<p>You can write parentheses yourself: implicitly, all expressions are left-associative. That means that the following are all equal:</p>
<pre><code>xyz = (xy)z = (x)yz = ((x)y)z</code></pre>
<p>But <code>xyz</code> is <em>not</em> equal to, say, <code>x(yz)</code>.</p>
<p>And here’s a puzzle to start flexing your combinator skills: one of the combinators in SKI combinator calculus is <code>I</code>, which is the identity function.</p>
<pre><code>Ix ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Try write an expression which functions the same way as <code>I</code>, using only the <code>BCKW</code> combinators. Use the following evaluator to try and figure out how to do it: write an expression after <code>λ&gt;</code> which functions the same as <code>I</code>.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>CK</code> followed by any combinator will do the trick. So <code>CKB</code>, <code>CKK</code>, <code>CKC</code>, etc.
<pre><code>I = CKC</code></pre>
Update 19/10/2020: A few people have pointed out (<a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/">Joachim Breitner</a> was the first) that there is a shorter solution to this problem: <code>WK</code>. I tend to prefer solutions that don’t include <code>W</code>, since then we’re working in a subset of the language that is both terminating and affine; although in this case the reason I didn’t mention <code>WK</code> is that I just didn’t find it myself.
</details>

<p>Each of the combinators we’ve defined so far work a little weird: they seem to skip over their first argument, and work on their second. Indeed, there is another, equivalent combinator calculus which doesn’t have this peculiarity:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Axy  ~&gt; y
Mx   ~&gt; xx
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p><code>B</code> stays the same in this calculus, but the rest of the combinators get switched out for seemingly simpler versions. <code>K</code> goes to <code>A</code><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>Axy ~&gt; y
Kxy ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Which isn’t a huge change. It’s the other two where we see the real difference. <code>W</code> has been swapped out for <code>M</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy
Mx  ~&gt; xx</code></pre>
<p>As you can see <code>W</code> basically does the same thing as <code>M</code>, but while passing through its first argument. The difference between <code>T</code> and <code>C</code> is similar:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p>So, first of all, it is pretty simple to show that <code>BCKW</code> contains all of the <code>BAMT</code> combinators. Try find a way to write <code>T</code> using only <code>BCKW</code> combinators (hint: you might want to use your previous answer for writing <code>I</code> using <code>BCKW</code>).</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> So in fact all of the changed <code>BAMT</code> combinators can be encoded using <code>BCKW</code> by putting <code>I</code> (or <code>CKC</code> or what have you) after the corresponding <code>BCKW</code> combinator. In other words:
<pre><code>T = CI = C(CKC)
A = KI = K(CKC)
M = WI = W(CKC)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>It’s pretty easy to go from <code>BCKW</code> to <code>BAMT</code>, then. However, it’s <em>extremely</em> difficult to go the other way. Here, try to write <code>K</code> in terms of <code>BAMT</code> (this is quite difficult, do not expect to get it!):</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> Either of the following would work:
<pre><code>B(TA)(BBT)
B(B(TA)B)T</code></pre>
</details>
<p>So this is why we will stick to <code>BCKW</code> for the time being: <code>BAMT</code> is just too painful to use.</p>

<p>One of the things <code>BCKW</code> has over <code>SKI</code> is that each combinator represents a concrete capability. <code>K</code> and <code>W</code> especially: without these combinators, we can neither duplicate nor discard variables. This makes the languages without one or both of these interesting (albeit not Turing-complete).</p>
<p>If we say that we can’t use <code>W</code>, we know that the will not duplicate any input. In fact, encoded appropriately, we know that the program can only decrease its size through execution. The <code>BCK</code> system is in fact an encoding of <em>affine</em> logic, which is all the rage nowadays. Rust uses affine types to guarantee memory safety: by preventing duplication of references, you can know that whenever you’re looking at a variable you’re free to modify it, or destroy it if necessary (obviously Rust is a bit more complex than what I’ve described here, but <code>BCK</code> is indeed the fundamental basis for the system in the same way that <code>SK</code> can be the basis for any programming language).</p>
<p>If we remove <code>K</code> as well we have a <em>linear</em> language. This is even more restrictive, but is also quite actively researched at the moment: linear types have been used to construct languages for differential privacy, for instance.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue with <code>BC</code>: it doesn’t (strictly speaking) have an equivalent to <code>I</code>. You can write an expression which is <em>close</em>, but it will only actually compute when applied to at least 3 arguments. See if you can find it.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>BCC</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Usually we add <code>I</code>, though, to give us <code>BCI</code>.</p>

<p><code>S</code> is the only combinator we haven’t seen yet. It’s kind of a combination of <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>W</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Sxyz ~&gt; xz(yz)</code></pre>
<p>It does parenthesising, reordering, <em>and</em> duplication. This allows it to be powerful to be Turing complete only with the addition of <code>K</code>. Try first to construct <code>I</code> given only <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>SK</code> followed by any combinator will suffice.
<pre><code>I = SKK = SKS</code></pre>
</details>
<p>And now construct <code>S</code> from <code>BCKW</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Of course, to show that <code>SK</code> is universal we’d need to show that it contains one of the other universal systems. We won’t do that exhaustively here, but first just try to figure out <code>B</code> and <code>W</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>B = S(KS)K</code></pre>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = SS(SK) = SS(KI)</code></pre>
</details>

<p>The next task is to encode the <code>Y</code> combinator. This is a combinator that evaluates to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Yf ~&gt; f(Yf)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it encodes <em>recursion</em>. Like the <code>fix</code> function in Haskell, this combinator allows us to do recursion without explicit self-reference. And, of course, we can define this combinator using the combinators we’ve seen before, since our language is Turing complete. One encoding is <code>BM(CBM)</code>:</p>



<p>As you can see, <code>BM(CBM)</code>, when applied to <code>f</code>, yields <code>f(M(CBMf))</code>, which is equivalent to <code>f(BM(CBM)f)</code> (the <code>B</code> just hasn’t been applied inside the <code>f</code>). So this is indeed a proper recursion combinator.</p>

<p>Let’s try doing a little bit of programming with these combinators now.</p>
<p>In the lambada calculus, to encode numbers we often use the <em>church</em> numerals: that’s what we’re going to do here, too. A church numeral representing some number <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> is a function which takes two arguments, and applies the first argument to the second <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> times. Here are some church numerals in Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>zero :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
zero f x = x

one :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
one f x = f x

two :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
two f x = f (f x)

three :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
three f x = f (f (f x))</code></pre>
<p>Encoding these numerals in combinators is a little more difficult. Zero and one are obvious: they are <code>A</code> and <code>I</code>, respectively. Try to figure out two and three:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>WB</code>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>SB(WB)</code>
</details>
<p>It turns out that it’s pretty easy to encode numbers in a relatively small amount of space, using a binary encoding. First, multiplication on Church numerals is simply composition: so that’s <code>B</code> on our combinators. We already have 2 defined, so the next thing we need for a binary encoding is a successor function. And we know what <em>that</em> is, from the answer to 3!</p>
<p>This means we can encode normal number in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mo>log</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math> space (although it still takes linear time to evaluate). The following repl allows for numbers:</p>


<p>We could take up even less space if we allowed for non-normal forms. 4, for instance, could be encoded like so:</p>
<pre><code>M(WB)</code></pre>
<p>But we generally prefer to keep our encodings in normal form: otherwise there’s some extra evaluation we have to pay for when we go to use them.</p>

<p>Once upon a time SKI combinators were used as a target for functional compilers: Miranda, Haskell’s precursor, compiled down to a set of combinators which included <code>SKI</code>. Nowadays, Haskell is compiled to the “spineless tagless G-machine”: its compilation technique took over from combinators in the late 80s, and has been the dominant form since. Apparently the reason is that, on the current architecture of most computers, combinator-based compilation targets just aren’t fast enough. They generate too much garbage: as a result, …</p></div></div>

			<p>Following <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a> on forcing Mainland China DNS service upon Hong Kong WiFi users, this part analyzes how the periodic DNS queries on <code>qq.com</code>, as seen by users capturing the DNS queries, are generated from the recent Samsung phones firmware (as at Sept 2020) when WiFi is used.</p>

<blockquote><p>tl;dr: These queries are sent simultaneously to all DNS servers registered for the WiFi connection, including <code>114.114.114.114</code> when it is added under circumstances as examined in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a>. They are generated every 20 to 60 seconds (depending on settings and link conditions) when the following pre-conditions are satisfied, i.e. WiFi is connected (except with some known devices) with <code>mCurrentMode</code> not equals 0 (elaborated at the bottom of this article), and when screen is on.&nbsp; The queries are sent directly using the WiFi connection link, without going through the VPN / private DNS configured, presumably as they are intended for testing the WiFi network.&nbsp; The IP addresses returned by the queries are not further used, except for checking if they are in a private IP range (in which case the checking is deemed failed).</p></blockquote>
<p>The following is a technical (read: very boring) account of the findings. Jump to the end for hints to disable the DNS query for your home WiFi.</p>
<p>For better illustration of the source, a new Github repository showing the decompiled version of the same <code>wifi-service.jar</code> as in Part I has been created. It uses a different mode of the decompiler (JADX) to attempt to decompile more code to Java, even when there are issues in correctness. The repository is at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1">SM-N9750-TGY-1</a>.</p>
<h3>The main players</h3>
<p>The main controlling class for the logic is again under <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>.</p>
<p>As briefly mentioned in the last part, this class implements a state machine which represents the status of the WiFi connection being monitored. The states accept messages and respond to them by taking actions and / or transition into another state.</p>
<p>Separately, a subclass, <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, is responsible for the monitoring of the connectivity and signal strength. The analyzer is an Android <code>Handler</code> which consumes messages in an event loop. These messages can be sent by the parent state machine, from within the analyzer itself, or from other subclasses, to control the activities of the analyzer.</p>
<p>The most relevant messages in our context are defined as follows (unless otherwise specified, the line numbers are those of the <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a> file in the decompiled code):</p>
<p>Messages sent to the Analyzer to control the lifecycle of the checking loop (lines 115-117, 254):</p>
<pre>    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL = 135221;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_START = 135219;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP = 135220;
     ...
    private static final int NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS = 135223;
</pre>
<p>Messages representing external events sent to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine (lines 205-206).</p>
<pre>    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_OFF = 135177;
    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_ON = 135176;
</pre>
<h3>Let the query loop start</h3>
<p>When the phone screen is turned on, Android will send the <code>android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON</code> intent to the network receiver of this class (line 1149), which will in turn send <code>EVENT_SCREEN_ON</code> to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine. If the state is under <code>EvaluatedState</code> [Note 1], the <code>processMessage()</code> method, around line 2138, handles the message (for brevity, some reference to <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> in the code is omitted):</p>
<pre>    
case EVENT_SCREEN_ON:  //135176 
...
if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    sendMessage(obtainMessage(135188 /* CMD_RSSI_FETCH */, mRssiFetchToken, 0) ;
    if (isValidState() &amp;&amp; getCurrentState() != mLevel2State) {
        if (mNetworkStatsAnalyzer != null) {
            mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START); // 135219
        }
        startEleCheck();
    }
    if (mCurrentMode == 1 || mLinkDetectMode == 1) {
        sendMessage(obtainMessage(CMD_TRAFFIC_POLL/*135193*/, mTrafficPollToken, 0);
    }
}
...
</pre>
<p>This means that, when <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, WiFi is connected, and the connection is not with some known devices, it will send the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> message to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. (It will also perform other actions, like calling <code>startEleCheck()</code> to discover devices, but these are not relevant to our context.)</p>
<p>The message <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> from a few other places. Here is an extract of the <code>enter()</code> method of the <code>Valid</code> state, triggered when <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> enters <code>Valid</code> state (i.e. upon WiFi connection) (line 3077-).</p>
<pre>if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    ...
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START);
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS);
}</pre>
<p><code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent when <code>mCurrentMode</code> switches from 0 to other values under <code>Valid</code> state (line 3112).&nbsp; Together, it is ensured that all paths arriving at the status, i.e. Wifi is connected, screen is on, and <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, will trigger <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>.</p>
<p>Note that upon entering the <code>Valid</code> state, <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. Let’s look at what this message does first.</p>
<h3>The NetworkStatsAnalyzer</h3>
<h4>The “loop” structure</h4>
<p>The below shows a skeleton of the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> handler loop handling the above messages, with bodies of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> and <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP</code> omitted for the moment. (lines 4157-, 4477-, 5107-)</p>
<pre>private class NetworkStatsAnalyzer extends Handler
{
    ...
    private boolean mDnsInterrupted = false;
    private boolean mDnsQueried = false;
    private long mLastDnsCheckTime = 0;
    private boolean mPollingStarted = false;
    private boolean mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
    private boolean mSkipRemainingDnsResults = false;
    
    ...
    public void handleMessage(Message string) {
        long now = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final long elapsedRealtime = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final WifiInfo wifiInfo = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.syncGetCurrentWifiInfo();
        final int what = string.what;
        switch (what) {
        ...
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_START:
                if (this.mPollingStarted) break;
                if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) break;
                if (this.isBackhaulDetectionEnabled()) {
                    this.sendEmptyMessage(TCP_BACKHAUL_DETECTION_START); // 135226
                }
                this.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
                WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.initNetworkStatHistory();
                this.mLastRssi = wifiInfo.getRssi();
                this.mPollingStarted = true;
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
                ...
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP:
                ...
                break;
            case NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS:
                if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) {
                    checkPublicDns();
                }
                break;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The message <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code>, sent upon WiFi connection, will invoke the method <code>checkPublicDns()</code> if the WiFi is not a mobile hotspot. The method is as follows (line 4262-).</p>
<pre>public void checkPublicDns() {
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
        mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
        return;
    }
    mPublicDnsCheckProcess = true;
    mNsaQcStep = 1;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor wifiConnectivityMonitor = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this;
    String str = wifiConnectivityMonitor.mParam.DEFAULT_URL_STRING;
    DnsThread mDnsThread = new DnsThread(true, str, this, 10000);
    mDnsThread.start();
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID = mDnsThread.getId();
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.DBG) {
        Log.d(TAG, "wait publicDnsThread results [" + WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID + "]");
    }
}</pre>
<p>We see the problematic <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> method as discussed in Part I being used. It can be seen that the above code handles the “normal” case outside China. Upon WiFi connection, it will start an asynchronous DNS query in a separate thread called <code>DnsThread</code>, using the address in the constant <code>DEFAULT_URL_STRING</code> (hardcoded to “www.google.com” as shown in Part I). This is done once at the start of every WiFi connection. However, if <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> returns true, e.g. in the case of a phone in Hong Kong, it would just set the flag <code>mPublicDnsCheckProcess</code> to false and return, skipping the DNS query for google.</p>
<p>Then we look at <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>. On receipt of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>, the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, among other actions, sends the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> message to itself, and sets the flag <code>mPollingStarted</code> to true. This would kick start the checking loop, as to be explained below. Before taking these actions, it would ensure that the loop is not already started by checking <code>mPollingStarted</code>, and that the WiFi connection is not acting as a hotspot.</p>
<p>The main flow controlling logic of the body of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> polling loop is as follows (line 4509-).</p>
<pre>case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.SMARTCM_DBG) {
    Log.i(TAG, "mPollingStarted : " + mPollingStarted);    
}
if (!mPollingStarted) {
    break;
}
if ((WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != null) &amp;&amp;
    (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mEmptyBssid)) {
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mIWCChannel.sendMessage(CMD_IWC_ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL); // 135376
    int rssi2 = wifiInfo.getRssi();
    if (rssi2 &lt; -90) {
        if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mClientModeImpl.isConnected()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "already disconnected : " + rssi2);
            removeMessages(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
            sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP);
            break;
        }
        if (rssi2 &lt; -95) {
            if (rssi2 == -127) break;
           …</pre></div></div></article></div></div>

What if I maintained a Set of IDs that belong to open conversations for each support channel? <br></p><p>All I have to do now is this: On every conversation update, if status is open, I add that conversation ID to the Set and I remove it from the Set if status is closed.<br></p><p>This Set would be stored on the RAM of course and yes it would take up more memory than storing just a single count for every support channel but all we are doing is storing IDs and not the entire data object so it would hardly cost much in terms of memory.<br></p><p>How does this help with the problem? Well, if you want the count of open conversations just get the number of elements in the Set, the cardinal number of the Set if you will. <br></p><p><strong>Why is this elegant? </strong></p><p>Because a Set cannot have duplicates. It does not matter how many times I add an item to a Set, a unique conversation ID can be added to it only once and similarly once a remove operation is performed, subsequent remove operations on the same conversation ID won’t have an affect on the data. The data has become idempotent.<br></p><p>This means that I don’t need an if-else condition when a conversation update operation is performed.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Amazon provides the ability to create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html">Billing Alarms</a> that can be used to alert whenever your AWS bill exceeds a certain threshold. However, this approach has a few shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to set a predefined threshold. When you are first starting to use AWS, it’s hard to know what your AWS bill will look like. A lot of people set this threshold pretty low to be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alert like this tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The alarm gets triggered once the threshold has already crossed. For example, I had forgotten to turn off an EC2 instance I was no longer using but I only found out about a week later once my billing threshold crossed the limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">Cost Explorer</a> does provide an easy-to-use interface that can help keep you on top of your billing data. However, this requires one to use the tool regularly to ensure we don’t miss anything.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at how to build a simple pipeline to send us billing reports over email. The generated report will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-cost-alerts/billing-email.png" alt="billing-alert-email" title="Billing Alert Email"></p>
<p>The tools we will use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Simple Email Service</li>
<li>Cost Explorer API</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-scaffolding">Create scaffolding</h4>
<p>We will create a new folder called <code>app</code> which will store the application logic for the Cost Explorer API as well as using SES.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>app
<span>touch </span>app/__init__.py app/cost_explorer.py app/email.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We will also create a file called <code>handler.py</code> in the root directory. This file will contain the logic used to generate billing reports.</p>

<h2 id="cost-explorer-api">Cost Explorer API</h2>
<p>We will be using the <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ce.html#CostExplorer.Client.get_cost_and_usage">Cost And Usage</a> endpoint from Cost Explorer to get the billing data we need.</p>

<p>Next, run the script from your terminal using the following command:</p>

<p>If your AWS profile is setup with the appropriate permissions, you should receive an email with your billing data. This what the email should look like:</p>

<h2 id="integrating-aws-lambda">Integrating AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>Now that we have generated the billing report locally, we will make use of the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless Framework</a> to create a serverless pipeline using AWS Lambda.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Setup serverless framework by following the instructions listed <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following commands after installing the serverless framework.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>npm init <span>-f</span>
npm <span>install</span> <span>--save-dev</span> serverless-python-requirements
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>serverless-python-requirements</code> plugin automatically bundles dependencies from <code>requirements.txt</code> and makes them available to your Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-serverless-project">Setting up the serverless project</h3>
<p>Next, create the file <code>serverless.yml</code> in your root directory and copy the following content:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the past few years, every company I interact with doesn't get the same email address from me. I'm trying to be as plain as possible with this post, but we're going to go on a bit of adventure. So what I'm really trying to say here is, “You should be doing this too and your privacy is important.”</p>

<p>The rest of this article is why it matters to you, but most importantly, what you do matters for everyone.</p>

<p>An email address identifies you on the internet. It's how your friends send you chain letters. It's how companies send you receipts and track your purchasing habits. Out of all the billions of people online, it's how anyone or anything identifies you and can get in touch.</p>

<p>Now, if that's all an email address is really used for, it's probably fine to just have the one. But that's not all that your email is used for. I'd like you to take a journey of the imagination with me for a little bit.</p>

<p>You don't need to close your eyes, but really try to picture this in your mind. Or maybe even grab some pen and paper and draw this out, especially if you've got aphantasia.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="building-a-mind-map">Building a Mind Map</h2>

<p>In the middle of this page, mental or otherwise, scrawl your email address. Then write a company that knows your email address. Draw a line from your email address to the company. Repeat this again for a second company.</p>

<p>Right now, you should have two companies each with a line connecting to your email address. Imagine for a second that those two companies wanted to work together through a partnership. Each one has your email address and all of the information they've gleaned from you using their service, whatever that might be.</p>

<p>Draw a line between the two companies. You can't know for sure, but the worst case scenario is they both share all the information they have about you with each other.</p>

<p>Let's lean into this worst case scenario. Keep adding companies that know your email address. Draw a line between every company, make sure they're all connected. Again, you can't know for sure, but do you know they're not talking about you?</p>

<p>Looking at this graph, what could be known about your life?</p>

<p><em>Where you live, what you buy, who you talk to, what you like, what you don't like, what you eat, what you drink, your religious and political affiliations.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implications-of-knowledge-sharing-without-your-consent">Implications of knowledge sharing without your consent</h2>

<p>If you haven't heard about Cambridge Analytica before, now would be a great time to look them up. This is an example of when just one company collaborates with another company that has access to all of your personal information.</p>

<p>In this case, it's Facebook pimping out your private information to a company that runs targeted digital advertising campaigns. I'm sure you've heard about the electoral college before. And you know some states are really entrenched with a certain political affiliation.</p>

<p>Other states though, are swing states. These are what make and break an election campaign. Campaigns are extremely expensive to run, so it makes sense to prioritize the budget into areas that make the most impact.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica specializes in identifying swing voters in swing states, profiles them accordingly and then runs targeted advertising campaigns. They whisper in your ear whatever you need to hear to convince you to vote for their candidate.</p>

<h2 id="cambridge-analytica-and-me">Cambridge Analytica and Me</h2>

<p>If you've been following this blog, you know that I quit Facebook cold turkey a few months ago. I always knew I would, but the reason it was finally the right time was surprisingly simple.</p>

<p>I was trying to start a dialog and to break out of the algorithm. Everyone I'm friends with on Facebook, I can guarantee is a real person. I never made internet friends on that platform.</p>

<p>I knew in the run up to the 2016 election that tensions were high. I was working in Silicon Valley and graduated from Liberty University. I tried  to create <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary" rel="nofollow">a Facebook app to allow for a third-party primary</a> where I'd calculate the likelihood you were a <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/person/real.js" rel="nofollow">real person</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/person/eligible.js" rel="nofollow">eligible to vote in America</a>, based on <a href="https://github.com/tylerchilds/alternative-primary/blob/master/lib/fb_parser.js" rel="nofollow">your facebook information</a>.</p>

<p>The gist was, both candidates were so bad, I believed we could finally elect a third party candidate and break the stranglehold of the two-party system in America. A vast majority of people I talked to conceded both candidates were bad and they were voting for what they believed to be, “the lesser of two evils.”</p>

<p>In my mind, all we needed to do is have a third-party primary where we all commit to vote for the candidate that wins. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" rel="nofollow">Instant-Runoff Voting</a> to mitigate the need for voters to hedge their bets on a lesser evil and instead rank candidates by their actual preference.</p>

<p>I couldn't get this app approved because Facebook had become a lot more stringent on their app usage guidelines. I won't speculate much, but I do believe ongoing Cambridge Analytica events and their relationship to Facebook are worth noting here.</p>

<p>Long story short, I'm trying to say, I know a bit about the practical capabilities of the information Facebook has at their disposal and the technical know-how to use it to build applications.</p>

<p>So why did I quit Facebook and why only a few months ago and what does this have to do with it?</p>

<h2 id="algorithmic-consequences">Algorithmic Consequences</h2>

<p>Because I know my friends on Facebook and my friends know me, even though we disagree, I've never stooped down to childish levels to get my point across. We might not see eye to eye, but there's a mutual respect that is rare these days and must be cherished.</p>

<p>So my simple answer is, I quit Facebook because of Tim.</p>

<p>That came out wrong, so I guess we do need a more complex answer.</p>

<p>Tim and I both attended Liberty University, he was my prayer leader the first semester on campus. I know Tim is a good-hearted dude, we've had many deep and spiritual conversations, even though our lives only intersected briefly.</p>

<p>When I was seeking to break out of the algorithm, I was actually looking for Tim. Well, someone like Tim, it didn't need to be Tim. We'll probably need to know Tim's perspective, but my hypothesis is that I had not been on his timeline in years until reaching across the algorithm.</p>

<p>This was a bit intentional on my part. You see, years earlier, I watched as an old high school friend, Josh, was eaten by Facebook's algorithm. At one point in time, Facebook used to show all your friends posts in chronological order.</p>

<p>It was really cool because you knew when your friends were bored. They'd be posting a lot and you were bored too, so you'd message them and be like, “hey, let's hang out.” But then the timeline changed to be controlled by an algorithm.</p>

<p>I gamed this for a little while and became low-key addicted to Facebook popularity. If you could get some likes quickly, you'd show up on more timelines and get more likes. I was quickly able to discover what was entertaining to my Facebook friends and would milk them for a little bit of dopamine on my end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was watching Josh fade away. We were never super close, but I respected his authenticity. That dude posted about his life and it was depressing, but it was real. I watched as his posts trickled from ~20 likes, to 10, to 5, to 2, to maybe if he was lucky, he'd get a single like.</p>

<p>The only difference was the algorithm change. The exposure of his posts to his friends decreased because Facebook deemed his content less important than content people were engaging with, like mine. I was pegging 50 to 100 likes around then. I mean, I'm not a thirst trap, but that was pretty good if you adjust for social inflation.</p>

<p>With this, my research into social media algorithms was complete. It's really that simple, you are either are popular enough to be seen or you're essentially shadow-banned.</p>

<p>In protest of this and in solidarity with Josh, I chose to post less on Facebook. It's pretty bogus for Facebook to have this level of control on what we see or we don't see.</p>

<p>So that's the point I'm getting at here with Tim. In our discourse, Tim said something like, “I don't see what you're seeing, help me see what you're seeing.”  I know Tim meant that, I know we're not seeing the same stuff because Facebook is feeding us both different content to keep us engaged with the platform longer so they can get more money.</p>

<p>Tim, what I'm seeing is Facebook controlling the worldview of our friends and family. It might be free as in free beer, but it's not free as in freedom. Hollywood can point a camera at just the right angle and make films that look and feel authentic, but they are fake and hollow facades.</p>

<p>The difference between Hollywood and Facebook is that you know you're in for a night of fiction and fun when you buy a movie ticket.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="reeling-it-in">Reeling it in</h2>

<p>That was a longer tangent than anticipated, so let's get back to your email record-linkage mind-map. That detour we took through Facebook is the example of just one company exploiting your private information for personal gain.</p>

<p>Looking at your map, I'm sure you see some companies on there you trust whole heartedly. If you do, I hope you pay those companies money, because it's only a matter of time before they'll need to sell you out to make ends meet. Benevolent dictators are only benevolent if they live short enough to never become just dictators.</p>

<p>But hey, let's be realistic, not all companies will sell your personal information. It's a little conspiratorial and genuinely unproductive to jump to that type of  conclusion prematurely. All of my Facebook ramblings here have also been anecdotal at best.</p>

<p>Without concrete facts, I'd be no better than QAnon or any of the other bullshit you'll find on social media to hold your attention.</p>

<p>I made a lot of great friends at Inflection and worked with some amazingly talented people there. So I just want to clarify upfront, that sigh and that …</p></div></div>

<p>Today at around 10:45pm CET, after a couple of glasses of red wine, we deleted the production database by accident 😨. Over 300.00 scoreboards and their associated data were vaporised in an instant.</p>

<p>Thankfully our database is a managed database from DigitalOcean, which means that DigitalOcean automatically do backups once a day. After 5 minutes of hand-wringing and panic, we took the website into maintenance mode and worked on restoring a backup. At around 11:15pm CET, 30 minutes after the disaster, we went back online, however 7 hours of scoreboard data was gone forever 😵.</p>

<p>To be precise, any scoreboards created or scores added on the 17th October 2020 between 15:47 CET and 23:21 CET have been lost. We are extremely sorry about this.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/disaster.jpg" alt="Blue green tennis"></p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

<p>It’s tempting to blame the disaster on the couple of glasses of red wine. However, the function that wiped the database was written whilst sober. It’s a function that deletes the local database and creates all the required tables from scratch. This evening, whilst doing some late evening coding, the function connected to the production database and wiped it. Why? This is something we’re still trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Here is the code that caused the disaster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>database_model_create</span>():
    <span>"""Only works on localhost to prevent catastrophe"""</span>
    database <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_DATABASE
    user <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_USERNAME
    password <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PASSWORD
    port <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PORT
    local_db <span>=</span> PostgresqlDatabase(database<span>=</span>database, user<span>=</span>user, password<span>=</span>password, host<span>=</span><span>'localhost'</span>, port<span>=</span>port)
    local_db<span>.</span>drop_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    local_db<span>.</span>create_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    <span>print</span>(<span>'Initialized the local database.'</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>host</code> is hardcoded to <code>localhost</code>. This means it should <strong>never connect to any machine other than the developer machine</strong>.  Also: <strong>of course</strong> we use different passwords and users for development and production. We’re too tired to figure it out right now.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-why-won-t-this-happen-again">What have we learned? Why won’t this happen again?</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that having a function that deletes your database is too dangerous to have lying around. The problem is, you can never really test the safety mechanisms properly, because testing it would mean pointing a gun at the production database.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that having a backup which allows a quick recovery is absolutely essential. Thanks DigitalOcean, for making this part reliable and simple.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that even a disaster can have some up-sides. This blog post generated a lot of interest. When life gives you citrus fruits, and so on.</p>

<p>The truth is, we can never be 100% sure that something like this won’t happen again. Computers are just too complex and there are days when the complexity gremlins win. However, we will figure out what went wrong and ensure that this <em>particular</em> error doesn’t happen again.</p>

<h2 id="some-perspective">Some perspective</h2>

<p>Thankfully nobody’s job is at risk due to this disaster. The founder is not going to fire the developer – because they are one and the same person.</p>

<p>Also, this webapp is just a side-project. It’s not the software that’s running a power-plant. Nonetheless, we have many users, some of them paying customers, and we try our very best to make them happy. Today we let those users down and that hurts.</p>

<p>The wonderful irony is that not 4 days earlier we tweeted a <em>hilarious</em> meme about deleting your production database:
</p><blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/mOlFqWal08">pic.twitter.com/mOlFqWal08</a></p>— Keepthescore.co (@keep_the_score) <a href="https://twitter.com/keep_the_score/status/1315552102299598851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>Again, we are very sorry. Good night.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever wondered how Elon Musk is running two billion-dollar companies at once? Musk is an interesting example of someone who manages his time so well that he can work 100 hours a week and still manage to take time out for his hobbies, family, and even Twitter! So, how does he do it?<br></p><p>Musk is known for using timeboxing methods to manage his time effectively. He uses timeboxing from the moment he wakes up in the morning where he assigns each time block to a certain task that he needs to accomplish on a given day. This timeboxing method can be used for any tasks ranging from writing emails, scheduling meetings, meditating or anything that you would like to do on a particular day.<br></p><p>Before I began using timeboxing, I learned about another technique called <strong>Themed days</strong>. I decided to combine both to maximize productivity. Themed days are <strong>strategically planned days in your calendar, which are entirely dedicated to one single thing or tasks from the same category</strong>. While timeboxing is <strong>to allocate a certain amount of time to a task in advance and then complete it within that time frame</strong>. The idea behind these two techniques is to eliminate context switching or minimize it.<br></p><p>How to use them? Very simple.<br></p><p>Make a list of 4-5 things you want to focus on this week. For example:</p><ol role="list"><li>☎️ Talk to 5 customers</li><li>💻️ Implement features X,Y &amp; Z</li><li>🎨 Redesign landing page</li><li>✍️ Write a blog post about productivity<br></li></ol><p>These are going to be your “themes”. Now open your calendar and assign a day for each one. Let’s say you want to work Monday and Tuesday on coding the missing features. Use Wednesday to interview customers, etc, you got the idea. (Tip: give each theme a color or an emoji 😉️)<br></p><p>Themed days could be super useful if you already have a day job and are trying to make time for your side hustle. Instead of trying to work on it one hour each day after your day job when you already feel exhausted, you dedicate a whole day for your side project.</p><p>With the one hour a day approach, the chance you could skip the scheduled hour is higher; <strong>with themed days, maintaining self-discipline is much easier.</strong></p><h2>Timeboxing</h2><p>To spice things up a little bit, you should use time timeboxing. Once you finished assigning themes and each day has one:</p><ol role="list"><li>Zoom in on each day</li><li>Add sub-tasks for that day’s theme</li><li>Add a time estimate to each task, and frame it with a start and end time.<br>‍<br></li></ol><p>You want to avoid any tasks without a clear deadline, even if the deadline is not accurate. According to Parkinson’s Law, if you have more time to finish a task, the overall time that you will take to finish the task will also expand. This holds true for many people and timeboxing greatly helps in dealing with that as well.<br></p><p>It’s important that as much as possible in Step 3 above, you avoid the <strong>mental optimistic bias</strong> of underestimating how long the completion of a task would require. When we’re too optimistic about how long a given task is going to take, we fail to completely follow through on what we set out to do.This bias, can be avoided by simply using a <strong>feedback loop, </strong>where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. At the end of each day or at least once a week, reflect on your progress and review the things you worked on that week and think to yourself how you could improve.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Timeboxing is amazing if you learn to do it effectively. In simple words, it is a process to merge your to-do list with your calendar. Another benefit of timeboxing is that it reduces the number of choices you’d have to make in any given moment — boosting your willpower for peak productivity.</p><h2>Productivity as an indie hacker</h2><p>To maximize your productivity, you must set your priorities straight. For me as a developer, I find myself investing the majority of my time coding, but as an indie hacker who wants to build a profitable business, I must focus on other stuff too; marketing, promoting, writing, and talking to customers. Themed days made me realize that <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/post/is-coding-a-procrastination-trap">coding could be a procrastination trap</a>.<br></p><p>Applying theme days helped me break out of the dev-hamster-wheel (aka coding) and forced me to do more of what needed to be done. So I decided to structure my themed days to look like this:<br></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: Coding <br>‍<strong>Tuesday</strong>: Coding<strong><br>Wednesday</strong>: Writing / Learning<strong><br>Thursday</strong>: Coding&nbsp;<strong><br>Friday</strong>: Housekeeping / Reflecting&nbsp;<strong><br>Saturday</strong>: Marketing / SEO&nbsp;<strong><br>Sunday</strong>: Writing&nbsp;</p><p>As you see, I only code three days a week, so I can focus on other equally or sometimes even more important things.</p><p>I also found themed days to be very effective when it comes to dealing with new or unexpected tasks. Depending on the task’s "theme", I know precisely on which day it should be scheduled. It takes me a fraction of the time to add it to my system.<br></p><h2>Themed Inbox</h2><p>I took themed days an extra step and applied it to my Gmail inbox. With a <a href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/gmail-snooze-script/">super cool trick using Google Apps Script</a>, I have control over when emails hit my inbox. Instead of checking my email everyday and having dozens of unrelated emails, now emails show up in my inbox on the right day. For example, all unimportant emails are scheduled for Friday (my Housekeeping day), while all marketing &amp; SEO related emails come in on Saturday, and so on. This way I make sure I read the right email at the right time when I’m ready to act on it. So cool, right?<br></p><figure id="w-node-01d3452ce5a9-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8eb994e7219ad5c7a6_aacavebgfxMyaKY5fTJeYgq5iGSUGD-5kW-_E5b-80Oo0IdiLDzEmok9W3WkT5_U-_woBP59Bk2TJg2xCFos_w3fsecvjQiGpCcArpMwuSTAgkbBQkGZUL0fY1dDm_AIU3Vs5NiL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The script automatically label emails</figcaption></figure><h2>Building a system: find a tool that works for you.</h2><p>When it comes to productivity in general, it’s important to have an efficient and flexible system that can adapt as your needs change without investing countless hours rebuilding everything from scratch.<br></p><p>Notion has been the core part of my system for the last five months. I’ve been experimenting a lot with different productivity techniques and approaches and it would have been so hard to do that without a super flexible and elegant tool like Notion. It's my second brain and where I store everything, so I’m using it to implement themed days, with Notion build-in templates.<br></p><p>I have a database where I have designed a template for each day and theme. Every morning, after preparing my coffee, I create a new page for that day using the proper template. The new page gets populated with everything I need to be as productive as possible on that day.<br></p><p>For example, on Saturday, which is a marketing/SEO day, I have a page with all the resources and reminders related to that subject.<br></p><figure id="w-node-5a939054f819-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e51775d3896dd2ca8_IR7wRnLd7_xn6THm_98T9fff1sIPhOhPUMI39ZsvQZckACxBvIC6BGD4oOj2ke_tcSEynYyETcdgfdGl_6kFQibk_no8hh-5oawKs_-YBQTp8GeLS8dstn5kCNhbzySBkC7BNe7X.png" alt="my Notion templates"></p><figcaption>Notion template for each day of the week</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-fb4ef460147c-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e1cd4becfc1e46ca2_RaH23NZlbiaNZOdoL6Pg-aIbRYxrnuE3L3A2-ttTweWCPEe_vbzW6XUu0d-Ycspa372e7ZdciYXHQsFhw_3jadOX_Soqdvqd_ohmn1ikovesCXtAMPrdljxuWiv9Gt15cxeWtB9x.png" alt="Saturday template"></p><figcaption>Saturday's template, focus on marketing &amp;&nbsp;SEO</figcaption></figure><p>What I found really nice about this approach is that my templates are not static, and as I keep updating them, they keep evolving and improving.</p><h2>Next level: Themed weeks</h2><p>If you really want to level up your game and accelerate your progress even further, you can implement themed weeks.</p><p>One of my favourite indie makers, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a>, has implemented themed weeks for his workflow. Jon works in a 2 weeks sprint, one week of coding, followed by one week of marking, and then wraps it up by writing a newsletter and changelog. When I asked him if he tried shorter sprints, he said that he did but found shorter sprints lead to too much context switching, and two weeks sprint works very well for him.<br></p><p>You can also use the same concept to devote the whole week to a single project, and really make huge advancements, or to a certain business function, and today, with all the rapid prototyping tools available, you could take a week to build an MVP/prototype and test your idea on the market.</p><h2>Give it a try and see for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to see what themed days can do for your productivity is merely trying it out. Here's your homework:</p><ul role="list"><li>Make a list of 3-4 categories/themes you want to focus on (e.g writing, coding, marketing)</li><li>Break them down to atomic tasks, ideally each sub-task should take one hour or less</li><li>Map each theme to a day of the week</li><li>If you can’t find time on working days, try to do it on a Saturday.</li><li>Open your calendar</li><li>Timebox the sub-tasks by scheduling them on their dedicated day</li><li>Get excited -message me to hold you accountable- and do it!&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>I promise that afterwards, you will feel a sense of achievement and see the progress that can</p><p>be made with this approach. It’s time to make room in your calendar for what matters!</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div>]]>

    <div>
      <p>What follows is an <strong>unedited guest post by the author of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/">Applied Divinity Studies</a></strong> about Substack. While I don't necessarily endorse everything said in the text that follows, I thought it was an interesting post and the author asked me to guest-post it here.</p>
<p>Some thoughts of my own as a prologue: </p>
<p>Looking at things I read in my RSS I notice first that indeed I look at <em>my RSS reader</em> (Feedly), and not at my mailbox. RSS is a civilized way of following updates from disparate sites you like, aggregating them in one central place that's separate from the mailbox where they can be saved to be read later, organized by source if need be. Newsletters —stuff that hits your inbox— strike me as barbaric. We solved the problem of centralization of consumption of diverse sources and then at some point there was some collective forgetting?? Maybe for a business that doesn't have a corporate blog a newsletter (With news about the sender) makes more sense, but blogs-via-RSS do not find a good replacement in the form of spammy inbox periodicals. One argument for newsletters is that it allows senders to track metrics about who reads their work, how much they read, etc. In Nintil for example while I have some Google Analytics metrics, I have zero information if you read it via RSS and not open the page; but I don't care, I don't even know off the top of my head how many people read Nintil every month; the reason I have Analytics is to tell me from where my blog is being cited, so I can follow the discussion about what I have written elsewhere. Nintil is not written for an audience I carefully cultivate. If you like Nintil you are free enjoy it (no paywalls here) and if you don't you can read something else. Because of that, I don't have a pressure to keep writing blogposts all the time, or feel the urge to squeeze a post out of the random daily occurrence just to be able to push the daily post. </p>
<p>But not every publication is a vehicle of self-expression. Monetized newsletters are there to make money. And that's fine. But paid content seems to fall into one of a few buckets: either politics (hooliganism ensures you'll pay) or businessy/financey pieces (Because reading may give you an edge somehow, or so you think). Who would pay (regularly!) for Nintil? If you like Nintil, you can donate via Patreon. Nintil is also the production of public goods (Like my Longevity FAQ; there I offer you months of research, for free, open to everyone), which is also incompatible with the paid model.</p>
<p>Do I read any substacks? I use <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">kill the newsletter</a> to convert newsletters into well behaved RSS feeds, and perusing my stash of feeds I can see Nadia Eghbal's and Anton Howes'. This will be no surprise given what I said above: My interests do not lie in operating businesses or following current events <sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup>, and that seems to be the bulk of what the Substacks are about. Not that I have tried particularly hard to scan their repertoire for something that I may like more.</p>
<p>
  [1]. You will have noticed that Nintil is an oasis in a desert of covidposting :)
</p>
<p>So by no means I can be a qualified critic of Substack; first because I am not that well aware of the various 'stacks, second because they seem to target an audience I am not part of. It would be as if I wrote beer (All beers taste equally awful to me) reviews; the problem would be me, not the various beers.</p>
<p>This all said, there is something to be said for being paid to write and it's good that there exist platforms that allow people interested in publishing under that model. I am not making a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/markets-morals">Sandelian</a> critique here, I very much am a proponent of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Markets-without-Limits-Jason-Brennan/dp/0415737354">markets in everything</a>, but I also want this blog to be fully unpaywalled (I'm not selling you a product, after all), and I wish the same were true of other blogs (or newsletters); moreover I don't think paywalling content will lead to better quality <em>unless</em> the author is working full time on it. Is there a moral case for supererogatory open blogging? Probably.</p>
<p>Now, the guest post. Enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The style will often be strange, incorrect, overburdened, and loose, and almost always strong and bold. Writers will be more anxious to work quickly than to perfect details. Short works will be commoner than long books, wit than erudition, imagination than depth. There will be a rude and untutored vigor of thought with great variety and singular fecundity. Authors will strive to astonish more than to please, and to stir passions rather than to charm taste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1835)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mathematics of churn are the best thing for niche artistic interests since the invention of patronage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Byrne Hobart, <a href="https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/understanding-netflix-5ab8f528f5b4">Understanding Netflix</a> (2017)</em></p>
<p>De Tocqueville’s indictment of American style is equal parts exoneration. If things have always been bad, we can hardly blame new media for the decline of society.</p>
<p>And yet, each time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpG11vFqglA">a new platform claims to be the exception to the rule</a>, it bears repeating, as many times as it takes, that this is not a good state of affairs.</p>
<p>I’ve rewritten this post three times, each more dogmatic than the last. So I’ve decided to forsake all the flashy rhetoric and just soberly explain the structural mechanics behind Substack’s relentlessly milquetoast taste.</p>
<h3 id="homogeneity-within-newsletters">Homogeneity Within Newsletters</h3>
<p>Top substack writers all have a clear focus. The Dispatch writes about politics, Matt Stoller writes about monopolies, Bill Bishop covers China.</p>
<p>Isn’t this normal? After all, no writer can be expected to cover every topic. In an age of disaggregation, we should read from experts instead of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/28/polymath/">casual polymaths</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, the apparent normality obscures its historical peculiarity.</p>
<p>Consider SlateStarCodex, one of the most popular blogs in a pre-Substack era. It had posts ranging from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/17/slightly-skew-systems-of-government/">political science fiction</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/15/the-vision-of-vilazodone-and-vortioxetine/">pharmacology</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/">artificial intelligence</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/09/11/update-on-my-situation/">media economics</a>. That’s not a selective assortment, it’s his last few posts in chronological order.</p>
<p>(Or consider Nintil, which covers everything from <a href="https://nintil.com/longevity">longevity</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/better-science">meta-science</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma">education</a> and <a href="https://nintil.com/pascals-mugging">decision theory</a>.)</p>
<p>Heterogeneity works for blogs since you grow through an occasional viral hit, and gain loyal readership through the occasional post that strikes a reader just right. As SlateStarCodex’s author <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3ygr2w/why_is_scott_alexander_sorta_popular/">describes his success</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting the premises, maybe because I write a lot of stuff? There are about 500 SSC articles, one every couple of days. Even if I'm no better than anyone else, there are a lot more opportunities for people to stumble across the one that they like, be impressed, and start following me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is not merely homogeneity of topic, but homogeneity of substance. If you have to publish a newsletter every week, you don’t have the room or incentive to take risks.</p>
<p>In financial terms, blog posts have asymmetric returns with capped downside but unlimited upside. If you write a bad post it won’t get shared and no one will see it. If you write a great post and it goes viral, everyone on the internet thinks you’re a genius. Since content is shared organically, your best work gets way more exposure than your worst. The incentive in these situations is to ramp up variance and do the most interesting writing you can muster.</p>
<p>That dynamic is also good for readers. If a piece is bold but wrong, you can just close the tab. If it’s bold but right, you’ve hit a gold mine. Since readers can be massively diversified across authors, they can benefit from increased variance in the underlying assets while insulated from associated risk. In the Blogosphere, Twitterverse and even on Medium, readers could enjoy long tail upside without commensurate cost.</p>
<p>In contrast, every single edition of a newsletter is delivered to every single reader, and since a lot of it is paywalled, there’s little potential virality. This is aggravated by the one way valve on subscribers: one someone churns out, they’re unlikely to give you a second try. So the ensuing incentive is not to take any bold risks, avoid alienating readers, and write whatever will appeal to your current audience.</p>
<p>This might sound true for other newsletters, but not for yours. After all, you’re an interesting person, and you have interesting thoughts. More importantly, your readers are smart people who demand insight!</p>
<p>The problem is that like pop-music, pop-science and all other pop-culture, pop-writing can only appeal to the largest common denominator. Even if the author and readers are interesting people in isolation, aggregation forces this blob of individuals into a milquetoast morass. As David Foster Wallace <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qN9Z9UQWwsgC&amp;pg=PP35&amp;lpg=PP35&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cpeople+tend+to+be+extremely+similar+in+their+vulgar+and+prurient+and+dumb+interests+and+wildly+different+in+their+refined+and+aesthetic+and+noble+interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjrMDxtfb7&amp;sig=ACfU3U3-gMCmnE9nVX7fjG_K2cDvjw4sVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjls7yHrJvsAhWxMn0KHYCQAj0Q6AEwA3oECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cpeople%20tend%20to%20be%20extremely%20similar%20in%20their%20vulgar%20and%20prurient%20and%20dumb%20interests%20and%20wildly%20different%20in%20their%20refined%20and%20aesthetic%20and%20noble%20interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">once described it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is of course undeniable that television is an example of Low Art, the sort of art that has to please people in order to get their money ...this is a logical function of its need to attract and please Audience. And I'm not saying television is vulgar and dumb because the people who compose Audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests, and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests. It's all about syncretic diversity: neither medium nor Audience is faultable for quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="homogeneity-across-newsletters">Homogeneity Across Newsletters</h3>
<p>Still, homogeneity within newsletters might not sound like such a crime. If each person is an expert in their domain, a reader still has the option of reading broadly and getting a taste of each hermetic utopia.</p>
<p>Except that structural forces also ensure a homogeneity across newsletters, ensuring that you never read anything too original.</p>
<h4 id="global-ranking">Global Ranking</h4>
<p>Subcultures allow for an escape from status as a zero-sum game. If you’re the <a href="https://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/10/economics-of-status.html">king of your own world</a>, you don’t feel bad for being at the bottom of someone else’s social ladder (<a href="https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society#external-links">1</a>, <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">2</a>). Bloggers know they aren’t universally popular, but it doesn’t matter as long as you have your corner of the internet.</p>
<p>In contrast, Substack totally violates <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/01/23/social-capital-in-silicon-valley/">Social Fog of War</a> by instituting a <a href="https://substack.com/discover?utm_source=substack#top-paid">global leader board</a>…</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>A lot of my job is about safety. Safety prevents errors from happening but, more importantly, when people feel safe, things become safer.</p>
<p>It’s a strange phenomenon that I’ve seen time and time again where if you lay out processes and tools that make things like software deployments safer, the effects continue to compound long after the change has happened. As people feel more and more secure in doing deployments, raising issues and speaking confidently in a company, the amount of failure goes down.</p>
<p>Conversely, the more <em>unsafe</em> an environment, the more failure compounds. When people feel ridiculed or judged for raising their hand to call out an error or a bug they <em>think</em> might be happening, they will raise their hand less and less. As people feel less confident about speaking out, more and more failure goes unmonitored until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Not to mention, people in safer environments are <em>happier</em>. Which environment would you rather work in: a technically brilliant project dictated by one or two people with no room for opinion or discussion; or a project outlined by a senior colleague who asked for feedback regularly and gave your opinion serious consideration and discussion even if it didn’t make it into the final product? A lot of feeling safe is about feeling valued.</p>
<h2 id="maslows-hierarchy-of-needs">Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs</h2>
<p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/psych_safety_Untitled-2020-10-14-1331.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve said the word “safety” a lot there but I should probably explain what that means. In terms of safety when it comes to the workplace, I subscribe to the idea of Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs - which I first learned about back in secondary school.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you have a pyramid of requirements, where fulfilling each level requires you have fulfilled the level below it, until eventually you’ve reached the top level of “self-actualisation” which is this idealised view of achieving one’s full potential.</p>
<p>In reality, things aren’t <em>as</em> cut and dry and you can certainly achieve certain levels without having its predecessor fully solidified or secure but it’s a good mental model of understanding what people <em>need</em>. In terms of what I want to talk about, self-actualisation can also be viewed as “feeling safe”.</p>
<p>The hierarchy breaks itself down into 3 categories and 5 levels. I’m going to tackle them top-down.</p>
<p>At the top, we have the end goal of reaching our full, happy potential which is it’s own category of <strong>Self-Fulfillment Needs</strong>. That is, these are the things that drive us, professionally or creatively, and give us satisfaction in life.</p>
<p>To reach self-fulfillment, you need to have your <strong>Psychological Needs</strong> met. <em>Esteem Needs</em> covers things like respect and prestige in life or just a general feeling of accomplishment. This can come from regular reviews, praise and a feeling of responsibility in your work. And to fulfil your esteem needs, you need to have your <em>Love &amp; Belonging Needs</em>. These come from intimate or close relationships (romantic or platonic) and are born out of a sense of community and togetherness.</p>
<p>To reach your psychological needs, you need to have your <strong>Basic</strong> <strong>Needs</strong> met. Personal <em>Safety Needs</em> are things like your home as well as security in your job or financial status. These are things that give you predictability for the foreseeable future. Finally, to achieve all of the above you have to meet your <em>Physical Needs</em>. Things like food, warmth, water and sleep. All those pesky things you need to keep track of to keep living.</p>
<p>Maslow’s Hierarchy is important here because, although it may not be your job to meet these needs, if someone doesn’t have these building blocks then they are not going to feel totally safe in their work. For example, if someone’s working on a rolling monthly contract, they might be more worried about “am I going to be let go this month” rather than “is this code ready to deploy right now” as they hit the big red button and scurry off to make a comforting meal.</p>
<p>If you are in charge of a company, it’s important to reduce as much cognitive load on your employees as possible. If someone is anxious about setting up a pension or worried about moving next month or is having issues with a colleague, those are all things that will distract them from their job. You should be looking for ways to help people feel safe and happy in their work. From a capitalist point of view: happy people are more productive and more productivity means more money. Investing in your employees’ wellbeing (with opt-in offers, don’t force anything on people) will probably be a net benefit for you for many reasons.</p>
<p>What’s important for us right now, though, is that people who feel safer, act safer, concentrate more as they make and deploy things, and reduce failure significantly.</p>
<h2 id="the-toyota-kata-and-the-andon-cord"><strong>The Toyota Kata And The Andon Cord</strong></h2>
<p>I love talking to new teams about the story of the Andon Cord in the Toyota manufacturing factories in the late 1900’s cause it’s such a great example of 1) how to treat failure positively; and 2) how to reduce failure by empowering people and making them feel safe.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1990, Toyota’s factories added this physical rope, called the Andon Cord, that followed along the assembly line. If you pulled the cord, the manufacturing line would stop nearly immediately. Now, most people I’ve met start thinking that this is a safety switch - that in an emergency you can pull it to prevent harm - but it’s not!</p>
<p>Mike Rother authored a book called “Toyota Kata” which is where the West first learned about this concept (I think, don’t quote me on that) but what he says in that book is that the cord is a tool to install autonomic behaviour in the people on the assembly line. He called this “kata”. When someone pulled the cord , everything stopped and an “andon” (most commonly a flashing light) would light up above the workstation.</p>
<p>The team-lead for that section would then physically go to that station and see what the issue was. Toyota lives by a “Show Me” culture which aims to eliminate any of the bias related to the problem because both parties are present at the issue and can only work with the facts of what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Something very important to the psychological safety we’re discussing is that when the team-lead arrived, the first thing they always did was thank the team member for pulling the cord. This reinforced the feeling of safety; you were not judged for pulling the cord, it was <em>always</em> a good thing because it was <em>always a good thing</em> to prevent an issue or defect. You may have added time in the moment to the process but in the long-run, you were saving the company the money and time involved in processing the results of that defect.</p>
<p>No matter how small the issue or if the cord was tugged mistakenly, there were never any repercussions and it was always treated as a positive thing. Toyota, at their core, believed that failure created learning opportunities and that it wasn’t a negative thing.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://itrevolution.com/kata/">If you’d like to read more about the Toyota Kata, check out this great post by John Willis.</a></em></p>
<h2 id="making-failure-a-positive-experience"><strong>Making Failure A Positive Experience</strong></h2>
<p>The idea that we learn from failure is a tale as old as time but it’s a crucial part of psychological safety and my day-to-day job. Workplaces should feel <em>challenging</em> but not <em>threatening</em>. Modern teams' success often builds off the ability to take risks while still being vulnerable in front of our peers.</p>
<p>In Site Reliability Engineering, <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">being Blameless</a> is a core tenet of our approach to learning from failure. We try to instill a culture where every “mistake” is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the overall team/project/system.</p>
<p>When something negative happens, there needs to be conversations afterwards about what can be learned from it and what can be improved. The best results will come from a team that feels safe enough to talk frankly about their shortcomings, the shortcomings of the company and the reality of a situation. Think of a situation where you made a change that cost your company a couple thousand euro in sales - in a psychologically <em>un</em>safe environment, there’s no way you’d put your hand up to admit what happened for fear of being demoted or fired. And without a clear understanding of everything that happened, how could you possibly talk about fixing this in the future?</p>
<p>Making failure a positive experience is a culture shift and it happens gradually, not all at once. Regardless of your position in a team, start by admitting your own mistakes. When you fail, give clear signals that it’s okay to fail and it’s okay to call you out when other people see you making mistakes in real time.</p>
<p>It’s important to encourage risk-taking in your teammates and to make room for growth. Not every idea is golden because sometimes initiatives fail and projects don’t turn out the way you imagined. It’s a good idea to take a moment at the end of a milestone of a project and have an honest discussion about the good things, the bad things and the things that could be improved in the future.</p>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive but you need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Being open and vulnerable will incur some level of discomfort with your peers, it’s inevitable. For example, you might be someone who likes control and relinquishing that control may make you uncomfortable, but giving others the space to try something new is the only way to figure out if that crazy idea is crazy enough that it just might work.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the discomfort in the moment but try to approach it as a collaborator, not as an adversary. You should all collectively work together towards understanding and volunteering for risk, so that when failure does happen, you have replaced <em>blame</em> with <em>curiosity</em>.</p>
<p>Creating psychological safety around failure encourages people to think about how things can be improved, rather than focusing on blame and how it happened.</p>

	Competition in the High-Performance Computing GPGPU market has emerged with GPGPUs from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel targeting future Exascale class systems.
	The new AMD Radeon Instinct MI50 hints at the capabilities of AMD’s future GPUs.
	</p>
	<p>
	This study takes a first look at the MI50 performance on characteristic scientific and machine learning applications.

<p><a href="https://emerging-architectures.github.io/amd_mi50_benchmarks/assets/images/poster.pdf"><img src="https://emerging-architectures.github.io/amd_mi50_benchmarks/assets/images/poster.png" alt="ISC-HPC 20 Poster"></a></p>



<p>We evaluated four reference systems representing a variety of modern consumer- and professional-grade hardware:</p>
<ol>
  <li>a <strong>GTX 1080Ti</strong> system with PCIe gen 3x16 GPU-GPU IC,</li>
  <li>a <strong>RTX 2080Ti</strong> system with no GPU-GPU communication,</li>
  <li>a <strong>Tesla V100</strong> system with NVLink, and</li>
  <li>a <strong>AMD Radeon Instinct MI50</strong> system with two xGMI hives.</li>
</ol>

<p>All systems are use the single-root, dual-socket SuperMicro SYS-4029GP-TRT2 system.
System details, diagrams, and benchmarking results can be found in the poster.</p>

<p>We ran two case studies that represent common workloads we run in our lab:
(a) a GPU-optimized rotating detonation engine simulation, and
(b) a compute-heavy deep learning training task.
Implementation and methodology details are described below.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-machine-learning-benchmarks">Running the Machine Learning Benchmarks</h4>

<p>Our machine learning benchmarks were run using TensorFlow 1.15 and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks">TensorFlow 1.x CNN benchmarks</a>.
While the tensorflow benchmarks are no longer updated for TensorFlow 2.x, they have been optimized for TensorFlow 1.15, making this a useful and replicable task for comparing GPGPU performance.</p>

<p>Because our tests are run on a single node, we use the default <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training">TensorFlow Distributed</a> MirrorStrategy with the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl">NCCL</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl">RCCL</a> all-reduce algorithm.</p>

<p>The benchmark task is training ResNet50-v1 on a synthetic ImageNet dataset using a momentum optimizer.
This compute-heavy task is characteristic of many other deep computer vision tasks with its dense image inputs and a deep, feed-forward, mostly convolutional architecture that translates well to GPGPUs.</p>

<h5 id="singularity-containers">Singularity Containers</h5>

<p>We used the HPC-oriented container platform <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/">Singularity</a> (v3.5.2) to manage our environment and dependencies for this study.
Singularity ≥3.5 is required for ROCm support.</p>

<p>All reported results were collected using official TensorFlow and ROCm images available on Docker Hub. Singularity images can be pulled with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>singularity pull docker://<span>$IMAGE_WITH_TAG</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can start a shell or run a script with:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># start a shell in the container environment w/ NVIDIA GPU access</span>
<span>$ </span>singularity shell <span>--nv</span> <span>$PATH_TO_SIMG</span>

<span># run a python script in the container environment w/ ROCm GPU access</span>
<span>$ </span>singularity <span>exec</span> <span>--rocm</span> <span>$PATH_TO_SIMG</span> python3 run.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following containers were used to collect reported results:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CUDA:</strong> <code>tensorflow/tensorflow:1.15.2-gpu-py3</code> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/tensorflow/tensorflow/1.15.2-gpu-py3/images/sha256-da7b6c8a63bdafa77864e7e874664acfe939fdc140cb99940610c34b8c461cd0?context=explore">link</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>ROCm:</strong> <code>rocm/tensorflow:rocm3.1-tf1.15-dev</code> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/rocm/tensorflow/rocm3.1-tf1.15-dev/images/sha256-21bad6c4225f92253fdcd5db4ba24ae850ee7b6e294cd23448ccd7288498f9b5?context=explore">link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="training-throughput">Training Throughput</h5>

<p>We measured computational performance of each system using <strong>training images per second</strong>.</p>

<p>An iteration includes both forward and backward passes through the network.
We used the largest power-of-2 batch size that would fit in GPU memory: 64 images/device for the GTX and RTX systems (11gb) and 256 images/device for the V100 and MI50 systems (32gb).
We ran enough warm-up iterations for the training speed to appear stable (5 steps for the NVIDIA hardware and 100 steps for AMD hardware).
The final training throughput is the median of three runs with 500 steps each.</p>

<p>The following script will run ResNet50 training benchmarks on 1-8 GPUs.
Fill out the variables at the top (<code>container_path</code>, <code>gpu_flag</code>, and <code>batch_size</code>) based on your specific system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>container_path</span><span>=</span>...

<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some other helpful environment variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code> and <code>HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code> control which GPUs are visible to TensorFlow.</li>
  <li><code>NCCL_DEBUG=INFO</code> will print out the GPU-GPU interconnects and NCCL ring topology used for the all-reduce operations, which is useful for verification purposes.</li>
  <li><code>NCCL_P2P_LEVEL</code> controls when to use direct GPU-to-GPU transport by setting the max allowable distance.
A value of 0 (or LOC) disables all P2P communications.</li>
  <li><code>TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2</code> will force XLA compilation, optimizing the graph for your given hardware.
This is particularly effective in mixed-precision mode when using GPUs with Tensor Cores.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html">Other NCCL flags</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other helpful benchmark options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>--trace_file=trace.json</code> will save a tfprof trace of your training process, averaged over the first 10 steps.
The results can be viewed at <code>chrome://tracing</code> in the Chrome browser.
This is useful for debugging distributed performance issues.</li>
  <li><code>--use_fp16</code> will run the training in mixed-precision mode.
This will use NVIDIA Tensor Cores on supported hardware.</li>
  <li>Full benchmark options can be listed with <code>python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --helpfull</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="power-efficiency">Power Efficiency</h5>

<p>Performance per Watt is an extremely important metric when evaluating HPC systems.
This is often reported in FLOPS/W (Floating Point Operations per Second per Watt) using a benchmark such as LINPACK.
For this study, we use a practical machine learning analog: <strong>training images per second per Watt</strong>.</p>

<p>We approximate power consumption as</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Non-GPU:</strong> <em>Running Average Power Limit</em>, or <em>RAPL</em>, is an Intel processor feature that provides information on energy and power consumption of different physical domains.
Average power draw was collected using the powercap interface: we queried <code>energy_uj</code> once per second over a 1-minute interval of a given workload, calculating average power over each timestep pair.
Power data was collected over package-0 (core), package-1 (uncore), and the DRAM power plane.
This excludes GPU power draw, which was recorded separately.</p>

    <p>We collected our data using code modified from <a href="https://github.com/ColinIanKing/powerstat">the <code>powerstat</code> tool</a>.
Other utilities for accessing RAPL metrics include <code>perf</code>, <code>turbostat</code>, or <code>powertop</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GPU:</strong> Average GPU power draw was collected using the <code>nvidia-smi</code> and <code>rocm-smi</code> utilities.</p>

    <div><div><pre><code># For NVIDIA
timeout 60 nvidia-smi --query-gpu=timestamp,name,index,power.draw --format=csv --loop=1 -f $LOGFILE

# For ROCm
for i in {1..60}; do rocm-smi -P --json &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE; sleep 1; done
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The power consumption measurements can be retrieved and averaged from these files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The utility scripts that we used can be found <a href="#">here</a>.
To collect power information for different modes,
we started a training run as described in <a href="#training-throughput">Training Throughput</a>,
waited until iteration 10 of training,
then manually started the power consumption monitoring tools.</p>

    <p>Serverless side rendering. What a buzz word salad.</p>

    <p>So what does it mean? Well, put simply, it means we render your website without the need for a server. This is not a new idea - and while we happen to use serverless technology to do it - this concept has been around in various (albeit somewhat hard-to-use) forms for years now. The idea is simple: take some HTML, JS, and CSS - and find a way represent what it might look like if someone loaded it in a regular web browser, so that web crawlers, robots, and most importantly, your users, see rich content as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>And of course - this is why we have Vercel, Netlify, Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt, and the slew of other hybrid or server-side generated solutions. All fantastic, but all come with one very important addendum: you have to build your project *their* way.</p>

    <div>
      <div id="how_it_works">
      <div>
  <div>
    
    <p>
      Host your web-app assets anywhere
    </p>
    <p>
      Netlify, AWS, Firebase, Herokuâ€”doesn't matter.
    </p>
</div>

  <div>
    
    <p>
      Point your renderer at hosted assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Render your javascript in a browser and save your static HTML.
    </p>
</div>

  <div>
    
    <p>
      Route your domain to your renderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When any client loads your site, the HTML data will be returned to crawlers!
    </p>
</div>

  </div>
</div>

    </div>

    <p>Call us old fashioned, but we don't like to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. The browser is the most widely distributed application runtime on the planet; and it's our point of view that you should be able to build your website exactly how you please. If it works in the browser, it should work anywhere.</p>

    <p>That's what Spirit Fish is here to do. Build your project with any tools, and deploy it anywhere. Tell us where it's hosted, and then point your domain at our CDN. When a new request comes in, we'll spin up your site in a headless browser, take a snapshot, and stash it in our CDN for the next user. Of course, there's all sorts of advanced things you can do with it, but really, that's it!</p>

    <p>We built Spirit Fish to be as low touch to your project as possible, because we believe in a world where we don't need to run a fleet of servers to serve a React app, or spend hours waiting for rebuilds when a single piece of content changes, just to show our users a social share card.</p>

    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

					<p>My sister Sana just wanted to earn some money before returning to college. She was looking for a covid-friendly job on craigslist, something to cut down on the student loans she'd have to take out for the year. After searching and scrounging, Sana found someone who needed logistical help taking care of their pets. She applied and was excited to get hired.</p><p>First, they needed help buying pet food. They had ordered $1,800 worth of pet food (they bought high quality stuff in bulk apparently) but the seller would only accept payments via Zelle. Her employer was a bit old fashioned and didn't know how to use that service, so they offered a different arrangement: “I’ll mail you a check for $2,000” they said, “please deposit it in your own bank account, and then use $1,800 of it to Zelle the payment to the sellers. The remaining $200 is your fee.”</p><p>Sana was a bit suspicious, but she deposited the check into her Chase bank account and it cleared a few days later. Chase’s site showed that the money had been deposited successfully and was available to use, no strings attached. </p><p>Seemed like it was legit. So she did the honest thing and Zelle'd the money &nbsp;to the seller.</p><p>Happy with the job well done, her "employer" sent her another $2,000 check to deposit and transfer. This person really liked their pets. The same process happened again, and her employer was happy with the job well done.</p><p>Two weeks later, Sana’s debit card stopped working. Confused, she checked her account to see what was wrong. </p><p>Her heart sank. </p><p>Chase showed it as overdrawn.</p><p>By more than three thousand dollars.</p><p>The checks had bounced, two weeks after Chase’s site had indicated they had “cleared”. Before this whole thing had started, Sana had $300 in her bank account. Now she had negative $3,300.</p><p>She had just been scammed out of $3,600.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2><p>Turns out checks can bounce weeks after they're deposited. It can take that long for the bank to verify they’re legitimate.</p><p>Why does it take so long? Here’s a peek behind the scenes:</p><ol><li>You deposit your check, and it shows up as pending in your account.</li><li>Your bank sends the check to the check-writer’s bank to request the funds.</li><li>Their bank verifies if the check is legitimate and the account actually contains the funds. At small or international banks this step is often manual and could take <em>weeks</em>.</li><li>Their bank lets your bank know it's legit. That's when the check has "cleared".</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The life cycle of a check</figcaption></figure><p>I skipped one step though: </p><p>It take can than more than <strong>six months</strong> for a check to clear, but banks remove that “pending” status just a couple days after it's deposited and allow people to spend the money. This might sound a bit iffy, but it's actually a good thing. Most checks are legitimate and people might need the money quickly. But that assumption breaks down with fraudulent checks.</p><p>By removing the “pending” status before fully verifying the check’s legitimacy, Chase gave the illusion that the check had already cleared. <em>This is what the scammers count on.</em> &nbsp;</p><p>Today there is <em>no way</em> for a Chase customer to be sure that a check has fully cleared. But unless you have the inside scoop on how banks work, or a finely honed sense of when someone is trying to swindle you, you won’t catch it.</p><p>When Sana called up Chase, the bank heard her out. But instead of stopping the scammers, their only concern was making sure she pays up the remaining $3,000 that they claimed she owed them.</p><p><em>Edit: Chase customer support had one clarification to make. I'd originally said it might take weeks for the check to clear, but they explained it could actually take more than six months. And you'll have no idea when that magic moment occurs.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 828w" sizes="(min-width: 525px) 525px"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="and-she-s-not-the-only-one-who-s-been-hit-by-this-scam-">And she's not the only one who's been hit by this scam.</h2><p>My friend David Vargas was caught by <a href="https://davidvargas.me/blog/i-got-scammed-out-of-5k/">pretty much the exact same scam</a>.

Of course not. Did they create an environment where scammers could thrive? Absolutely.</p><p>The harm was unintentional, but they played a hand in it. </p><p>Involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>What have other companies done when someone abused their products to deliberately cause harm? They took responsibility for it and fixed the problem at a systematic level.</p><p><strong>The Tylenol murders: </strong>In 1982, someone started <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982">spiking bottles of Tylenol</a> with poison, killing seven people. This was clearly not Tylenol’s fault, but they still immediately paid to recalled all bottles in the stores, offered anyone who had already purchased the pills free replacements. They took it a step further and <strong>developed tamper-proof packaging </strong>to prevent anyone from contaminating the medicine again in the future.</p><p><strong>Credit Card fraud services</strong>: Online payments are inherently risky. Credit card companies know this, and they’ve committed to helping their customers when the inevitable fraud occurs. If you pay someone with your Discover card and the product turns out to be a scam, <em>Discover will accept responsibility and refund you the money</em>, taking a loss if necessary. This dynamic keeps Discover on their toes working to prevent scams before they even happen.</p><h3 id="-2-how-should-they-fix-it">#2 How should they fix it?</h3><p>Make the status of the deposited check abundantly clear. This is how Chase can tamper-proof their bottles.</p><p>If a check has been deposited but not fully cleared, if it hasn't had the actual funds transferred over to the bank, then Chase needs to make that fact clear to customers! This missing piece of UX is what scammers depend on. That’s the systemic flaw here.</p><p>If the bank actually made the status of the funds clear to its customers, then it would have a much stronger leg to stand on when claiming innocence.</p><p>But as things stand right now, the only way a person could know the check was still at risk is if they already knew about the long clearing time and how banks hide it. Before the results come back from the external bank, Chase itself doesn’t know if the check is valid. Yet they offer customers no hint of that uncertainty.</p><p>And instead of taking responsibility, what did Chase actually do?</p><h3 id="chase-took-option-3-shakedown-their-customers">Chase took option #3: Shakedown their customers</h3><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Chase acted like the mafia, shaking down whoever they could to get their money back.</p><p>My sister had created this bank account back when she was in high school.

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working on a side project recently, related to <a href="https://tabbydata.com/">this other blog</a> that I started a few weeks back. (The project isn’t ready to share quite yet, but you might be able to guess what I’m working on from those posts!)</p>

<p>Even though I’ve tried to become much more pragmatic in my technology choices over the years, side projects still end up being a great way to experiment with new, shiny things—or at least, new <em>to me</em>. (As a side note, this aspect of side projects—selecting the right stack and practice learning new technologies—is one of the two main reasons I believe in the controversial idea that engineers who program outside of work are generally better at it than those who do not. The other reason is that it demonstrates they actually enjoy using their superpower.) The latest new, shiny thing for me is AWS Cloud9.</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-does-it-solve">What problem does it solve?</h2>

<p>AWS Cloud9 allows developers to build software entirely within their browser. In doing so, it actually solves a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The local environment doesn’t matter anymore; Mac, PC, Chromebook, as long as it can run a modern browser you’re all set.</li>
  <li>The local environment is easily reproducible. If your laptop dies and you need to spin up a fresh development environment, or if you want to collaborate with others and need a fresh development environment for them, it’s one click away.</li>
  <li>Your Cloud9 instance can act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host">bastion host</a> to the rest of your infrastructure, and it’s as secure as your AWS console.</li>
</ul>

<p>That was all pretty appealing to me, so I dug in.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>As usual, Amazon’s documentation is not the friendliest. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/setting-up.html">setup guide</a> is fine enough, but after that I floundered a bit. The main problem is that, once you set up your Cloud9 environment, you’re in an IDE and it feels like you should be doing things “the Cloud9 way” in order to avoid getting bitten later. It turns out that, at least in my case, ignoring that concern is sufficient. Basically, treat the terminal the same way you’d treat any SSH session into an EC2 box that you were planning to use as a dev environment (so use package managers from the terminal, run tests there, etc) and use the file manager/editor for their basic use-cases (or just use the terminal for everything if you want!). My project is built on Lambda, and Cloud9 has some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-functions.html">decent Lambda-specific features</a> but don’t feel that you need to use Cloud9-specific features for build/deploy steps; that is not its core use-case.</p>

<p>Ultimately Cloud9 is just a small convenience layer on top of just spinning up your own EC2 instance to use as a dev box, but the convenience is well worth it IMO. You don’t pay extra for running Cloud9 (you’re only charged for the underlying EC2/EBS infra) and the fact that Cloud9 automatically manages starting/stopping the instance for you makes it way more cost-effective than running the instance directly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>When sharing files, I use three main services. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Send">Firefox Send</a> and <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files">KeybaseFS</a> to share one-off and large files with friends, and I use <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> to store some personal files, and for everything school-related (I don’t get a choice about this). For the first two services, sharing a file is as simple as calling <a href="https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend"><code>ffsend</code></a> or moving a local file into my kbfs mountpoint, and I am done. Google Drive, on the other hand, the process isn’t as easy. While some Linux distributions have Google Drive integration out of the box (I miss daily-driving <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromiumOS</a>), Linux users generally have to go to <code>drive.google.com</code>, and deal with the Google Drive webapp. Not sure if this is an “only me” problem, but whenever I need to quickly make a change to a document through the webapp, It decides to stop working.</p>

<p>I really like the Keybase approach of mounting remote storage as a “network drive” on my laptop, and wanted to do something similar for Google Drive. This is where a great tool called <a href="https://rclone.org/"><code>rclone</code></a> comes in to play. Rclone is a very easy-to-use command-line application for working with cloud storage. I originally learned about it when I used to host this website on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/">DigitalOcean Spaces</a> a few years ago. Out of the box, Rclone supports <a href="https://rclone.org/#providers">many cloud providers</a>, including Google Drive!</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-rclone-for-use-with-google-drive">Setting up Rclone for use with Google Drive</h2>

<p>Now for the fun part, to get started with Rclone and Google Drive on your computer, you must first install Rclone. I am going to assume you are using a Linux-based operating system here, but with some slight tweaking, this works on BSD and Windows too!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Install Rclone with the automated installer</span>
curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | <span>sudo </span>bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once Rclone is installed, you need to hop on over to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Cloud Developer Console</a>, and create a new project. Under the <em>ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES</em> section, search for, and enable the <code>Google Drive API</code>. This will expose an API to your Google Drive, and let programs interact with the files (if setting up multiple accounts, you only need to enable the API on one of them). Click the <em>Credentials</em> tab in the left-side panel, then <em>Create credentials</em>. This will open a panel letting you set up access to your new API.</p>

<p>With the panel open, click <em>CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN</em>, <em>External</em>, then <em>CREATE</em>. Enter <code>rclone</code> as the application name, and save it. You now have set up one of those “sign in with Google” screens for yourself. Clicking the <em>Credentials</em> tab again will bring you to an area where you can generate the needed API keys for Rclone.</p>

<p>Click <em>+ CREATE CREDENTIALS</em> at the top of the panel, and select <em>OAuth client ID</em>. Set the application type to <em>Desktop app</em>, and finally, press <em>Create</em>. You will now be shown the needed info to link Rclone to your account(s).</p>

<p><em>Note: This API project is <strong>not verified</strong> by Google.</em><br>
<em>This means that you will be greeted with a scary warning when logging in the first time. Just ignore it.</em></p>

<p>Back in the terminal, we can run <code>rclone config</code> to set up a configuration for Google Drive. You will be prompted with many options. Use the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># &gt; rclone config</span>

<span># Create a new config</span>
n<span>)</span> New remote

<span># Set a name</span>
name&gt; my_drive

<span># Choose a storage type</span>
Storage&gt; drive

<span># You will be asked for a client ID and secret. These are the strings we just generated</span>
...

<span># Set the scope to allow Rclone access to your files</span>
scope&gt; 1

<span># Select the default option for everything until asked if you want to use "auto config"</span>
<span># When asked, say yes</span>
auto_config&gt; y

<span># Set team drive to no</span>
team_drive&gt; n

<span># Verify the information, then say yes</span>
ok&gt; y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Almost done. You need to run <code>rclone ls my_drive:</code> (the colon is important). This will probably ask you to go to a link, and enable an API. Do so.</p>

<p>Your Google Drive can now be mounted by running the following (feel free to change the paths to whatever you want)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/google_drive
rclone mount my_drive: ~/google_drive --vfs-cache-mode writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="starting-rclone-on-boot">Starting Rclone on boot</h2>

<p>You probably don’t want to run an <code>rclone</code> command every time you start your computer. This can be solved in one of two ways</p>

<h3 id="for-i3wm-users">For i3wm users</h3>

<p>On <code>i3wm</code>, just add the following line to <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> rclone mount my_drive: /home/&lt;user&gt;/google_drive <span>--vfs-cache-mode</span> writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> with your username.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind, <code>exec</code> commands are not run when reloading <code>i3</code> with <kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>. You must log out (<kbd>Mod</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd>), and back in again.</p>

<h3 id="for-ubuntu--debian-based-users">For Ubuntu / Debian-based users</h3>

<p>In pretty much any Debian-based system, you can edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (using <code>sudo</code>), and add the following line right before <code>exit 0</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rclone mount my_drive: /home/&lt;user&gt;/google_drive <span>--vfs-cache-mode</span> writes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> with your username.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The intellectual property debate is so hot these days that I can’t wander into a restroom without running across graffiti supporting one side or the other. Some people think that patents and other forms of intellectual property law are the bane of the free universe, and that these laws are not just misguided but actually evil and should be struck down as soon as possible. Others are convinced that pretty much the whole world economy is driven by intellectual property. And those people want to do anything to strengthen the legal status of IP rights. <mark>As a result, the graffiti on the issue gets quite graphic at times.</mark></p>

<p>Of course, most of it is on the virtual restrooms on the Internet, not so much the restrooms in the hotspots of San Jose’s nightlife<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
This, as anybody who lives in San Jose can tell you, is called IRONY. San Jose doesn’t have nightlife. People living here drive to San Mateo if they actually want to have fun
</span>.
There’ll be huge flamefests over some specific issue associated with intellectual property law, with people arguing everything from First Amendment rights to whether IP law might make open source development impossible sometime in the future. I find myself certifiably schizophrenic on the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t have an opinion: I have very strong opinions on the worth of intellectual property, but they end up being on both sides of the argument. I can tell you, this can be very confusing. It means that I end up arguing both sides. And I think this is because there really are two sides to intellectual property, and they share nothing but the name.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-is-not-property">Intellectual ‘Property’ is not Property</h2>

<p>To many people, including me, intellectual property is all about human inventiveness, about the very thing that makes us humans instead of animals (that, and thumbs, of course). And in that setting, the very name “intellectual property” is an affront: It’s not property to be sold like chattel, it’s the act of creation, it’s the greatest thing any human can ever do. It’s Art, with a capital A. It’s the Mona Lisa, but it’s also the end result of a long night of programming, and it’s an end result that you as a programmer are damned proud of. <mark>It’s something so precious that selling it isn’t even possible: It’s indelibly a part of who you are.</mark></p>

<p>That kind of creativity—whether it be in the form of painting, music, sculpture, writing, or programming—should be sacred. The creator and the thing he or she created have a bond that cannot be severed. It’s like the bond between a mother and child, or between bad Chinese food and MSG. But at the same time it’s something that everybody in the whole world should be able to be part of, because it is humanity.</p>

<p>And then, in the other corner, weighing in at an approximate seven gadzillion billion U.S. dollars a year, intellectual property is huge business. Human creativity got a price tag, and it turned out to be quite expensive. Creativity is rare, and as a result it is not just expensive but also extremely lucrative. Which brings in a totally different class of arguments, and totally different kinds of people. The kind of people who call the end result of human creativity “property.” Not to mention, of course, lawyers.</p>

<p>Read the title of this paper again. The “property” people are winning. After all, their name stuck. So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The most well-known example of intellectual property is the notion of copyright. Copyrights are basically the codification of the rights of any creator to do with his or her creation as he or she wishes. The “owner” of the creation can decide on how that creation should be used.</p>

<p>Copyrights are also legally very simple to get. You don’t have to register your copyright: You are automatically the copyright holder of whatever creative work you do. This is an important distinction from most other intellectual property law, mainly because it actually makes it easy for individuals, not just big corporations, to own copyrights. You can own a copyright, simply by virtue of writing, painting, or generally creating something unique. If you want to, you can add a legend like “(C) Copyright 2000 Yourname Here,” but quite frankly, you don’t need to. You own the copyright whether you say so or not. Saying so just makes it easier for other people to track you down if they want to use your work.</p>

<p>Of course, just owning a copyright in itself is not very useful. But the fact that you own what you create means that you can control how it is used. You have, for example, the right to sell such a work of art to somebody else, and nobody but the IRS gets to have any say in the matter. But it’s about more than just the money, and that’s where a lot of people seem to find themselves flummoxed.</p>

<p>For example, you can use your power as owner of a copyright to try to do more interesting things than just sell it. You can license it. This is even better than selling it; <mark>instead of selling the work of art you can sell the license to do certain things to it, and still retain the copyright on it. Basically, you can have your cake and eat it, too.</mark> This is how the Microsofts of the world get created: endlessly selling the rights to use something, without actually losing anything. No wonder people just love to own this kind of property.</p>

<h2 id="problems-of-treating-ip-as-property">Problems of Treating IP as Property</h2>

<p>Does anybody perhaps start to see a problem here? If you don’t see anything strange so far, I have a bridge and a few pieces of waterfront property to sell you.</p>

<p>The basic problem with intellectual property is starting to show itself: You as the owner of intellectual property can effectively sell it forever, without ever losing anything yourself. You don’t risk anything, and in fact you might decide to write your license in a way that basically says that even if the property is flawed, you cannot be held responsible in any way. Sounds preposterous? You’d be surprised. So, intellectual property offers no consumer protection.</p>

<p>It gets worse. The copyright holder not only has the right to sell his or her property without losing it, but also the right to sue people who sell property that looks like his or hers. Clearly the copyright owner has rights over that derived work. <em>Clearly</em>? Not so fast.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line between inspiration and copying? And what happens when different people come up with similar ideas? Who gets the gravy train of being able to sell his idea over and over and over again, and gets to tell the other people to butt out of his business? <mark>It’s not just consumers who aren’t protected, it’s also other creative people who are not protected by the notion of “intellectual property.”</mark></p>

<p>What makes the discussion ugly at this point is that a lot of the arguments for stronger intellectual property rights are based on the notion of giving inventors and artists more “protection.” What people don’t seem to ever realize is that giving such powerful rights to some people also ends up taking rights away from others.</p>

<p>And maybe not so surprisingly, the proponents of stricter intellectual property laws are the organizations that stand to gain the most. Not the artists and inventors themselves, but the clearinghouses of IP: companies that make a living off other people’s creativity. Oh, and lawyers, of course. The end result? Copyright law amendments like the infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which removes the last vestiges of consumer rights over the use of copyrighted material.</p>

<p>Now, if you are getting the notion that I think copyrights are actually detrimental, you’re wrong. I happen to absolutely love copyrights, I just don’t believe in taking the rights of the authors too far. Not to the point of screwing the consumer over. And I say this not just as a consumer, but as a producer of copyrighted material myself, both in the form of this book and of Linux itself.</p>

<p><mark>I, as a copyright holder, have my rights. But with rights come obligations—or as they say in certain neighborhoods, <em>noblesse oblige</em>.</mark> And so I have the obligation to use those rights in responsible ways, and not as a weapon against others who lack such rights. As one great American once declared, “Ask not what your copyright can do for you, ask what you can do for your copyright”—or something to that effect.</p>

<h2 id="patents-make-the-problem-uglier">Patents Make the Problem Uglier</h2>

<p>Copyright is, despite even the DMCA, a fairly mild and well-behaved form of intellectual property. The notion of “fair use” does still exist, and holding a copyright does not give all rights to the work to the copyright holder.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for patents, trademarks, and trade secrets; the heavy drugs of IP. Discussions over software patents in particular have gotten so inflamed in technical circles that it officially counts as one of the subjects you should not discuss in polite company, along with gun control, abortion rights, medical marijuana, and whether Pepsi tastes better than Coca Cola. And the reason is that patents, in many ways, give control over new inventions similar to that of copyrights, but with few of the redeeming qualities of copyrights.</p>

<p>One of the most awkward issues with patents is that, unlike with copyrights, you don’t get a patent just for inventing something new. No, <mark>you get a patent after you’ve gone through the painful and prolonged process of filing for it with the patent office.</mark> Waiting for the patent office, by the way, is a bit like standing in line at the DMV, but you have to realize that you stand in line with about twelve patent lawyers, and the line is …</p></section></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>To compliment the recent publication of my <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/hveprom-project/an-easy-to-build-mcs-48-8748-8749-8741-8742-8048-8049-programmer-reader/">MCS-48 programmer shield</a>, I thought it’d be interesting to build something useful based on one of these. Completed in 1976, the MCS-48 is 44 years old at the time of writing this article, giving us an opportunity to venture back into the distant past of embedded development, peeling away the many layers of hardware and software we typically float atop of on the likes of Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-711x800.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-711x800.jpg 711w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-267x300.jpg 267w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-133x150.jpg 133w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-768x864.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-1365x1536.jpg 1365w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mcs48temp_boardonly-1820x2048.jpg 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"></a></figure>



<p>With the prospect of building ones own gizmo based on the very first microcontroller – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS1000">TMS1000</a> hovering just <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/02/18/the-tms1000-the-first-commercially-available-microcontroller/">a hair above zero</a>, the MCS-48 offers us a decent consolation.</p>



<p>Unlike the almost equally ancient MCS-51 which refuses to die, industry decided to leave MCS-48 in the past. When looking at the details, it looks likely that the efforts of the MCS-48 project went into the MCS-51, however the two have neither instruction set, or pin compatibility. As such, MCS-48 does not have any modern descendants or tooling. With such a limited instruction set and no data stack, writing 3GL compilers for it would have been challenging, and resulting code would have been very wasteful of its limited resources.</p>



<p>The market for assembly language only microcontrollers contracted by the 1990s, by which point MCS-51 had taken its place, providing a full instruction set capable of supporting higher level language compilers. I was told by a friend that despite a movement towards C development, some engineers continued to pour over reams of MCS-48/51 assembly listings printed on green-bar well into the 1990s.</p>



<p>For a microcontroller with only GPIOs a single timer, 1K of program space and 64 bytes of data memory (32 depending on how you count it), it can be a bit of a stretch to think of something useful to do with it. This dual temperature sensor doesn’t need anything more, and it’s something I could just about bear the thought of programming in its assembler language, as there is not any other choice.</p>



<h2>Software development</h2>



<p>As I hinted to earlier, there is no C compiler for MCS-48, making writing software for these devices challenging. It is stated on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/M">Wikipedia </a>that a PL/M compiler was available for these however I was unable find it or any other mention. To add to the pain, there’s no hardware multiply, divide or subtract either. There <em>isn’t even</em> an instruction for comparing two numbers. All of this has to be pieced together with primitive logic instructions. As I worked my way through the implementation, I kept telling myself it would get easier. It didn’t.</p>



<p>Even being equipped with a <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/16702b/">proper logic analyser</a>, using modern PCs, editors and a very easy to use programmer, writing the software for this was still very difficult. It took me nearly three weeks to complete it, whereas an 8051 version (C/Keil implementation) of this same project I completed 7 years earlier was completed in under two days.</p>

Same functionality, similar hardware design, but software was written in C and built with Keil. Not as cool as this project.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I cheated a little by using a modern enthusiast-built assembler – <a href="http://asm48.sourceforge.net/">ASM48 </a>for this project.</p>



<p>Back in 1977, when these were first purchasable, there were no PCs or DOS  to write the software on. A purpose built machine, the Intel MDS-II (microprocessor development platform) with an assembler also from Intel was used. Some scanned manuals I’ve found show that the assembler outputs the following version string:</p>



<pre>ISIS-II MCS-48/UPI-41 MACRO ASSEMBLER, V3.0</pre>



<p>This may be a copy of it <a href="https://github.com/ogdenpm/intel80tools/tree/master/itools/asm48/3.0">here</a>. The MDS-II ran a special operating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(operating_system)">ISIS-II</a>. It is suspected (although not confirmed) that IBM developed the original PC BIOS on one of these machines too (<em>they certainly did not develop it on a PC</em>), there is an interesting thread about that <a href="http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-ibm-pc-bios-and-intel-isis-ii/">here</a>, which details the challenges of recovering these early development tools.</p>



<p>You can see the MDS-II pictured in the image below (blue, on the left).</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://p112.sourceforge.net/index.php?isx">simulator</a> for the ISIS-II platform. A potential interesting re-visit for the future.</p>



<h2>Programming an MCS-48</h2>



<p>Internal EPROM MCS-48’s cannot be programmed in standard EPROM programmers. They require a specially designed programmer. Hardware is still obtainable for however not particularly cheap. I went to the trouble of building my own programmer, in the form of an <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/hveprom-project/an-easy-to-build-mcs-48-8748-8749-8741-8742-8048-8049-programmer-reader/">Arduino shield</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the programmer, an EPROM eraser is also required. Mine is a classic design from the 1980s however there are plenty of cheapy Chinese units for sale on eBay these days.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>



<p>Typical debug techniques used on modern microcontrollers, for example printf() or in-circuit debugging are out of the question. An emulator would have been of little practical use as these devices almost always needed to be debugged in-situ.</p>



<p>Assuming you weren’t building a product that could be physically damaged by stopping the processor, the “austere” approach recommended by the databook is to use a romless version with a single step circuit, combined with the SS (single step) pin to step through your code with an external logic analyser attached to an external EPROMs address/data signals.</p>



<p>With this you can see what the program counter is up to, but you have no idea what any of the registers inside the CPU contain. If you need to see one of those, you have to copy it into the accumulator, then write it out onto the bus, assuming that doing so didn’t cause some kind of catastrophe, then capturing it with a logic analyser.</p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48.png 679w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48-300x187.png 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ice48-150x93.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px"><figcaption>Intellec MDS and Intel ICE-48 simulator</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well equipped engineers of the day may have been in possession of one of the above. The ICE-48 simulator was connected in place of a 40 pin MCS-48, allowing engineers to view the contents of internal registers, set breakpoints and single step. Quite a luxury compared with my experiences.</p>



<p>I found that the <em>easiest way</em> to debug an MCS-48 is to <strong>not debug it at all</strong>. Instead I repeatedly ran the instructions through in my head over and over again, and tried to get it right first time. <em>This is a lot less time consuming that any other approach</em>.</p>



<h2>A little joke, at my expense</h2>



<p>At the outset of this project I purchased an MCS-48 databook off eBay (I just wanted to have one). What I received was the original 1976 edition, which, <strong>has errors in it</strong>. <em>Damned eBay rubbish strikes again</em>.</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-800x465.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-800x465.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-300x174.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-150x87.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-768x447.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror-1536x893.jpg 1536w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pinerror.jpg 1849w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption>The incorrect pinout for the MCS-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Above is the stated MCS-48 pinout, which is incorrect. The RD/WR pins are shown swapped. My first revision of the schematic included this mistake, because I worked from this book. This lead to a lot of head scratching when I first attempted to debug it on my logic analyser.</p>



<h2>Taming the Quasi-Bidirectional GPIO</h2>



<p>On modern microcontrollers GPIOs are easy. We have register which can enable a pair of P/Nch FETs for use as an output, typically being able to sink and source a fairly decent amount of current, usually enough to power LEDs and small relays for example.</p>



<p>On the MCS-48, we are lumbered with the quasi-bidirectional GPIO. The databook makes a lot of how wonderful and innovative these are but from the perspective of having used modern ‘true’ GPIOs – they are a pain in the backside. </p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1.png 779w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-300x191.png 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-150x96.png 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mcs48quasi-1-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px"><figcaption><em>The schematic for the pin of each GPIO on an MCS-48</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Essentially these are both an input and an output at the same time. The input part is simply a buffer which is always sampling the external pin, and the output part is an N-ch FET which pulls the pin low, with an internal 50K pull-up providing the logic “high”. There is also a puny P-ch FET with an impedance of 5K which is asserted for one clock cycle to give a good rise time, but after that we’re hanging entirely off the 50K pull-up, which isn’t going to allow us to source enough current to do anything useful without buffering.</p>



<p>Why not just leave a 5K pull-up in circuit all the time? Because the design would be condemned to wasting a significant amount of power continuously where outputs are held low. You <em>could</em> put a strong pull-up to allow sourcing of a larger amount of current, but then you hit another problem in that the N-ch FET has an impedance of 300Ω so if the pull-up was 1K, you would end up with a 1.15V “low” voltage. Not ideal.</p>



<p>The characteristics of these pins lend themselves rather well to driving FETs. The 5K pull-up “pulse” means the gate will charge quickly, and the 50K will keep it charged. The 300Ω low side also works well. In this day and age getting large drive current from the GPIO on an MCS-48 (and MCS-51) is simply a case of slapping a MOSFET of the desired polarity straight onto the pin (you could add a gate resistor to reduce ringing, but not likely needed).</p>



<p>Not something that would have been done back in the day (transistors and carefully calculated base resistors would have been used) but is exactly what I’ve done in my design. As is stated repeatedly in the databook, these pins are able to drive the inputs of other TTL logic no problems, something also found on my design.</p>



<h2>ROM Variations</h2>



<p>Unlike the TMS1000 which was masked-ROM only, the MCS-48 came in a cornucopia of different ROM options and sizes.</p>



<p>I have often seen it stated that the 8048/8049 variants were “OTP” (one-time programmable). This is (sort-of) true. They were actually mask ROM programmed.</p>



<p>The code for masked ROMs for these devices was supplied to Intel by customers on punched-cards. The databook explains how these are to be formatted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Following the BoF on power consumption of software Cornelius chaired at
<a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/09/15/kde-akademy-2020-recap.html">Akademy 2020</a> I did
look a bit into tooling for that, in particular for cheap ways to measure electrical power
consumption. Here are the results so far.</p>

<h3 id="why-measure-electrical-power-consumption">Why measure electrical power consumption?</h3>

<p>Our existing profiling tools for improving software performance implicitly also identify parts
that presumably increase the power consumption, and we do have specialized tools like <code>powertop</code> that
are good at identifying specific types of power drains. But not everything is visible in there,
e.g. CPU/GPU trade-offs, or the actual effects of power management options or display settings.</p>

<p>So being able to measure the actual power consumption between the wall plug and the full device seems
useful, to the very least to verify that assumptions we make from other profiling tools actually hold.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Measuring electrical power isn’t exactly an unsolved problem, even if it’s not entirely trivial when
looking at the combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">alternating current</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply#Power_factor">switching power supplies</a>.
However, it’s not straightforward to find a solution when adding all our desired constraints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with a wide range of devices to measure without requiring modifications, and covering the total
power consumption, ideally something you just connect to the power plug and the wall socket.</li>
  <li>High time resolution: Power consumption of computing hardware can change very very rapidly, averaging
over a long time period might thus hide information relevant for us.</li>
  <li>Cheap: To actually make an impact, I think we need to spread the equipment widely in the community,
and that’s much more likely with tools that cost 10€ rather than a few k€.</li>
  <li>Easy and safe to operate for people without an electrical engineering background: Same as the above, that should
help spreading the tools widely.</li>
  <li>Bonus: Machine readable measurement data. That could allow us to build further software tools on top of this,
such as test automation or CI integration for checking for power regressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a solution that covers some of those requirements isn’t particularly hard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you compromise on price, there’s beautiful professional equipment for this.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on time resolution, there’s reasonably accurate devices sold
for about 10€ in every hardware store as e.g. “energy monitor”, typically with a small
LCD screen showing the accumulated electricity use over a period of time.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on safety (or at least accept considerable effort to achieve safety),
the necessary sensors to build a DIY measurement device only cost a few Euros.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="repurposing-a-wifi-power-plug">Repurposing a Wifi power plug</h3>

<p>While preparing the office at work for full remote operations earlier this year I came across a type of devices that seemed
to check all those boxes though: A Wifi-controlled power plug capable of running a Free Software firmware and an integrated
power sensor.</p>

<p>To try this I got myself a few <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/gosund_SP111_v2.html">Gosund SP111</a> for about 8€ a piece,
and replaced their firmware with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs">Tasmota</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/tasmota/docs/blob/development/docs/devices/BlitzWolf-SHP6.md">manual flashing instructions</a> might look
a bit scary, but thanks to “opportunities” in their stock firmware this can also be done conveniently over the air using
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">tuya-convert</a>. Following the Docker-based approach in their
instructions made this work on first try without any issues for me. Out of the box this was already showing power measurements in its
web UI, with an update interval of a few seconds.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/tasmotized-gosund-sp111.jpg" alt="Picture of two Gosund SP111 Wifi power plugs and a screenshot of the Tasmota web interface running on it.">
  
  <figcaption>Gosund SP111 Wifi power plug and the Tasmota web interface running on it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial values were not at all plausible though, going through the
<a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Power-Monitoring-Calibration/">power calibration procedure</a> helped with that.
Reading out measurements automatically is possible via MQTT, so that’s covered as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was reading through the firmware code, assuming it would need adjustments to allow higher sample rates,
but it turns out we can get this down to 200ms by just sending the right MQTT commands. The two following crude scripts running
in parallel produce a CSV stream with the various measurement values.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/VoltRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/AmpRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/PowerRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"5"</span>

<span>while </span><span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span>usleep 200000
    mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/STATUS"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"10"</span>
<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This sets the device to report measurements in the highest available resolution, and then polls in a 200ms interval. The
results are received and unpacked by the next script. Its output is CSV that can be redirected as needed.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>"Time;Voltage;Current;Power;Apparent Power;Reactive Power;Factor"</span>

<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="visualizing-measurements">Visualizing measurements</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of ways to process the CSV data, a real-time view turned out to be quite useful though. As the data
can be rather noisy a basic smoothing filter also helps to make things easier to read.</p>

<p>KDE’s <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/">LabPlot</a> can consume CSV “streams” and has the right filters for this. Unfortunately
its filters cannot be applied in realtime yet, so the LapPlot team pointed me to a much older KDE application that can do this:
<a href="https://github.com/Kst-plot/kst">Kst</a>. It’s filters are frequency-based, so we need a low-pass filter to smooth the
measurements. Not as nice as what LabPlot produces IMHO, but it gets the job done.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>Good news first: This is sensitive enough to see the impact of simple user interactions, power saving options
(ie. the Good/Bad toggles in <code>powertop</code>), display brightness changes, etc.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/power-usage-while-moving-mouse-cursor.png" alt="Plot of an example measurement showing power over time.">
  
  <figcaption>Example measurement (200ms sample interval, no filter): mouse cursor being moved between samples 100 and 150, with a peak while hovering a task bar entry.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How good this is, ie. how close the reported values get to reality, and to what extend the noise is inherent to the sensor
I have no idea though, lacking a calibrated reference to compare this to. Based on suggestions found online on how to reduce the
noise by hardware modifications I have to assume most of that is coming from the sensor.</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of things to further investigate here still, both regarding assessing and improving the quality and resolution
of the measurements (e.g. by looking into increasing the sampling frequency by modifying the Tasmota firmware, assuming that is even
useful), and regarding establishing the power impact of software settings or options.</p>

<p>While not doing work that we don’t need to do is of course better either way, there are many less obvious questions to investigate
with this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can we enable more of the power management options exposed by <code>powertop</code> by default? There’s probably good reasons why they are off,
but maybe that selection can be done more targeted? Or if it’s about user-decided trade-offs, maybe that can be made easier accessible
for more users?</li>
  <li>How do operations on the CPU and GPU compare, or different ways of accessing the GPU? Thinking about the various compositor settings here for example.</li>
  <li>How do we best perform long-running background tasks? As fast as possible with all available resources, or stretched out over time?</li>
  <li>Can we somehow make automatic screen brightness control more clever, e.g. by improving idle or presence detection?</li>
  <li>Can we save power by making a dark color scheme the default on OLED screens?</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just scratching the surface I guess.</p>

<p>As I didn’t break any of the Wifi power-plugs during these experiments, I still have two spares I can pass to anyone in the community
interested in digging into this as well!</p>

You can read it online for free from <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/">its website</a> or order an <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">ebook or paperback</a>.&nbsp;In this tutorial we're gonna focus on using the command line to clean our data.</p><h2>Pulling and running the docker image</h2><p>To remove the hassle of downloading files we deal with and dependencies we need, I've made a docker image for you that has all you need. You just pull it from docker hub and you'll find what you need to play with to let you focus on the cleaning part.&nbsp;So let's<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ezzeddin/clean-data"> pull that image</a> and then run it interactively to enter the shell and write some command-lines.</p><div><pre>$ docker pull ezzeddin/clean-data
$ docker run --rm -it ezzeddin/clean-data
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>docker run </strong>is a command to run the docker image</li><li>the option <strong>--rm </strong>is set to remove the container after it exists</li><li>the option <strong>-it</strong> which is a combination of <strong>-i </strong>and <strong>-t </strong>is set for an interactive process (shell)</li><li><strong>ezzeddin/clean-data </strong>is the docker image name</li></ul><p>If using docker is still unclear for you, you can see <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/penguins-in-docker-a-tutorial-on-why-we-use-docker">why we use docker tutorial</a></p><h2>Cleaning text files</h2><p>Let's clean two text files containing <a href="https://github.com/bhargaviparanjape/clickbait/tree/master/dataset">clickbait and non clickbait</a> headlines for 16,000 articles each.&nbsp;This data is used from a paper titled: <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~achakrab/papers/chakraborty_clickbait_asonam16.pdf"><strong>Stop Clickbait: Detecting and Preventing Clickbaits in Online News Media</strong></a> at <em>2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM). </em>Our goal here is to get the most common words used in both clickbait and non-clickbait headlines.</p><p>If you list what's inside the container you'll see two text files called <em>clickbait_data </em>and <em>non_clickbait_data</em>. Let's see what the final output first that we want to get. For the clickbait data, we want the most common 20 words to be represented like this with their counts:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e590d4bb2d5e8b98f68d_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the&nbsp;Author</figcaption></figure><p>And for the most 20 common words of non-clickbait headlines:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e5ff1f4c25700461fbc8_non_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>Let's see how we can get these histograms through the command line by taking it step by step. After running the docker image, we're now in a new shell with the new environment Let's first see what the <em>clickbait_data </em>file<em> </em>has by getting the first 10 lines of it:</p><p>So it seems this file has headlines that are labeled as clickbait as you can see:</p><div><pre>Should I Get Bings

</pre></div><p>We're interested in words here not phrases, so we can get words starting from 3 letters to more with:</p><div><pre>$ head clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}'
</pre></div><p><strong>head clickbait_data </strong>is used here because we're doing statistics here on the couple of headlines at the top of the file which is piped to the next grep command <strong>grep -oE '\w{3,}'</strong></p><p><strong>grep </strong></p><p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-oE -o </strong>for getting only matching words and <strong>-E </strong>for using extended regular expression which is the next pattern</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\w{3,}' </strong>this pattern is like <strong>'\w\w\w+' </strong>which matches whole words with 3 letters or more</p><p>In order to get the counts of each word we need to first get the unique words which we can get by <strong>uniq </strong>command with the option <strong>-c </strong>to give you counts, but to let <strong>uniq &nbsp;</strong>delete duplicate words you need to sort first:</p><div><pre>$ head clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c
</pre></div><p>This command is done on the first 10 lines, let's do it across the entire clickbait headlines:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c</strong> we're now putting this command (to get all the words across the clickbait data)&nbsp;into the standard input of the next command</li><li><strong>sort -nr</strong> to sort numerically in a reverse order to get the highest count first</li><li><strong>head </strong>to get the first 10 common words</li></ul><p>Here is the output of the previous command:</p><div><pre>   5538 You
   4983 The
   2538 Your
   1945 That
   1942 Are
   1812 This

   1326 What
   1242 Will
</pre></div><p>Looks like we're close now to be in a good shape, let's see what we can do to better clean that up.</p><p>If we get a deeper look</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89fb80aeaee61427802c66_deeper-look.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtravisphd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">David Travis</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/glasses?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can see we're missing small letters and all caps letters. For example, for the 'You' word we're missing 'you' and we're also missing 'YOU'. Let's try to see if these words already exist:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep you
$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep YOU
</pre></div><p>So as we can see:</p><p>We're missing 2 words that each can contribute to our counts to the 'You' occurrence and 'Your' to make them 5540 and 2540 respectively.</p><p>What we need to do first is to convert each capital letter into small ones using <strong>tr </strong>which is a command-line utility that translates characters:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre></div><p><strong>tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' </strong>here translates the contents of <em>clickbait_data </em>into lower-case. <strong>['upper'] </strong>is a character class that represents all upper case characters and <strong>['lower'] </strong>is a character class that represents all lower case characters.</p><p>To prepend these values with the header, we can use <strong>sed </strong>to put two column names to represent each column:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | sed '1i count,word' | head 
</pre></div><p><strong>sed '1i count,word' </strong>so we’re having <em>count</em> representing the number of occurrences and <em>word</em> obviously representing the word</p><p><strong>1i </strong>is used here to write these two words at the first line and the change in the file will be in-place</p><p>outputting:</p><div><pre>count,word 
5540 you
4992 the
2540 your
1950 that
1944 are
1812 this
1653 and
1397 for
1326 what
</pre></div><p>In order to print that in a pretty shape we can use <strong>csvlook </strong>which will get us this:</p><div><pre>| count        | word |
| ------------ | ---- |
|    5540 you  |      |
|    4992 the  |      |
|    2540 your |      |
|    1950 that |      |
|    1944 are  |      |
|    1812 this |      |
|    1653 and  |      |
|    1397 for  |      |
|    1326 what |      |
</pre></div><p>which is not pretty at all. The reason this happened is that <strong>csvlook </strong>works as its name indicates to a better look for a CSV&nbsp;file so we should have a CSV (Comma Separated&nbsp;Value)&nbsp;file first. We should then find a way to separate each value at each line with a comma. At this point, we can use <strong>awk </strong>which is a pattern-directed scanning and processing language:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $1","$2}' | sed '1i count,word' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p><strong>awk '{print $1","$2}' </strong></p><p><strong>'{</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print $1 </strong>here prints the first field (which is the count column) followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>"," </strong>a comma followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$2 </strong>the second field which is the word column</p><p><strong>}'</strong></p><p>It seems we're in much better shape now:</p><div><pre>| count | word |
| ----- | ---- |
| 5,540 | you  |
| 4,992 | the  |
| 2,540 | your |
| 1,950 | that |
| 1,944 | are  |
| 1,812 | this |
| 1,653 | and  |
| 1,397 | for  |
| 1,326 | what |
</pre></div><p>If we want to get the word column in the first field and the count column in the second field, we just need to reverse the order in the <strong>awk </strong>and <strong>sed </strong>command:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>In order to get the same output for the non-clickbait data, we just need to change the filename:</p><div><pre>$ cat non_clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><h2>Getting insight into the clickbait study</h2><p>In this study as reported by the <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~achakrab/papers/chakraborty_clickbait_asonam16.pdf">paper</a>, it addresses the clickbait and non-clickbait headlines to be able to detect both as</p><blockquote>Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention.</blockquote><p>So what's in this tutorial is a way to clean up data through the command-line so that we can get some insights about the result of this paper and see if we can get some points claimed by the paper through their research.</p><p>Again, let's see the final distribution of the most 20 common words for clickbait headlines for this data is:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e590d4bb2d5e8b98f68d_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>we can obviously see the excessive use of the possessive case <em>you </em>and not using the third person references like <em>he, she, </em>or a specific name</p><p>and …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Note that I am deliberately avoiding the <em>tech</em> side of this question. I’m not going to talk about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875">EEG</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078">PET</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768">MRI, and fMRI</a>. (Though they’re linked in case you want to learn more.) Modern brain-computer interface (or BCI) technologies are evolving too rapidly to bother with an overview of <em>them</em>. They’ll change in the real world by the time I press “publish,” much less by the time you read this. And sci-fi tech is most often a black box anyway. But the <em>human</em> part of the human-computer interaction model changes much more slowly. We can look to the brain as a relatively-unalterable component of the BCI question, leading us to two believability questions of sci-fi BCI.</p>



<ol><li>How can people express <em>intent</em> using their brains?</li><li>How do we prevent accidental activation using BCI?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s discuss each.</p>



<h3>1. How can people express intent using their brains? </h3>



<p>In the <em>see-think-do</em> loop of human-computer interaction…</p>



<ul><li><em>See</em> (perceive) has been a subject of visual, industrial, and auditory design.</li><li><em>Think</em> has been a matter of human cognition as informed by system interaction and content design.</li><li><em>Do</em> has long been a matter of some muscular movement that the system can detect, to start its matching <em>input-process-output</em> loop.

<p>But the first promise of BCI is to let that <em>doing</em> part happen with your brain. The brain isn’t a <em>muscle</em>, so what actions are BCI users able to take <em>in their heads</em> to signal to a BCI system what they want it to do? The answer to this question is partly physiological, about the way the brain changes as it goes about its thinking business.</p>

<p>Our brains are a dense network of bioelectric signals, chemicals, and blood flow. But it’s not chaos. It’s organized. It’s <em>locally functionalized</em>, meaning that certain parts of the brain are predictably activated when we think about certain things. But it’s not like the Christmas lights in Stranger Things, with one part lighting up discretely at a time. It’s more like an animated <a href="http://proportional symbol map">proportional symbol map</a>, with lots of places lighting up at the same time to different degrees.</p>

<p>The sizes and shapes of what’s lighting up may change slightly between people, but a basic map of healthy, undamaged brains will be similar to each other. Lots of work has gone on to map these functional areas, with researchers showing subjects lots of stimuli and noting what areas of the brain light up. Test enough of these subjects and you can build a pretty good functional map of concepts. Thereafter, you can take a “picture” of the brain, and you can cross-reference your maps to reverse-engineer what is being thought.</p>

<p>Similarly the brain maps we have are only for a small percentage of an average adult vocabulary. Jack Gallant’s semantic map viewer (pictured and linked above) shows the maps for about 140 concepts, and estimates of average active vocabulary is <a href="https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-does-the-average-person-know/#:~:text=According%20to%20lexicographer%20and%20dictionary,vocabulary%20is%20around%2040%2C000%20words.%E2%80%9D">around 20,000 words</a>, so we’re looking at a tenth of a tenth of what we can imagine (not even counting the infinite composability of language). But in the future we will not only have more concepts mapped, more confidently, but we will also have idiographs for each individual, like the personal dictionary in your smart phone.</p>



<p>All this is to say that our extant real world technology confirms that <em>thoughts</em> are a believable input for a system. This includes linguistic inputs like “Turn on the light” and “activate the vibranium sand table” and “Sincerely, Chris” and even <em>imagining</em> the desired change, like a light changing from dark to light. It might even include subconscious thoughts that yet to be formed into words.</p>



<h3>2. How do we prevent accidental activation?</h3>



<p>But we know from personal experience, we don’t want <em>all</em> our thoughts to be acted on. Take, for example, those thoughts you’re feeling <a href="https://bradfordhealth.com/halt-hunger-anger-loneliness-tiredness/">hangry</a>, or snarky, or dealing with a jerk-in-authority. Or those texts and emails that you’ve composed in the heat of the moment but wisely deleted before they get you in trouble.</p>

<p>If a speculative BCI is being read by a general artificial intelligence, it can manage that just like a smart human partner would.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>He is composing a blog post</em>, reasons the AGI, <em>so I will just disregard his thought that he needs to pee</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>And if there’s any doubt, an AGI can ask. <strong>“Did you intend me to include the bit about pee in the post?”</strong> Me: <strong>“Certainly not. Also BRB.”</strong> (Readers following the <em><a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/category/black-panther-2018/?order=asc">Black Panther</a></em> reviews will note that AGI is available to Wakandans in the form of Griot.)</p>



<p>If AGI is <em>unavailable</em> to the diegesis (and it would significantly change any diegesis of which it is a part) then we need some way to indicate when a thought is intended as input and when it isn’t. Having that be some <em>mode</em> of thought feels complicated and error-prone, like when programmers have to write regex expressions that escape escape characters. Better I think is to use some secondary channel, like a bodily interaction. Touch forefinger and pinky together, for instance, and the computer understands you intend your thoughts as input.</p>



<p><strong>So, for any BCI that appears in sci-fi, we would want to look for the presence or absence of AGI as a <em>reasonableness</em> interpreter, and, barring that, for some alternate-channel mechanism for indicating deliberateness. We would also hope to see some feedback and correction loops to understand the nuances of the edge-case interactions, but these are rare in sci-fi.</strong></p>

<h2>Even more future-full</h2>



<p>This all points to the question of what <em>seeing/perceiving</em> via a BCI might be. A simple example might be a disembodied voice that only the user can hear.</p>



<blockquote><p>A woman walks alone at night. Lost in thoughts, she hears her AI whisper to her thoughts, “Ada, be aware that a man has just left a shadowy doorstep and is following, half a block behind you. Shall I initialize your <a href="https://www.gattamatta.com/electric_scenario.html">shock shoes</a>?”</p></blockquote>



<p>What other than language can be written to the brain in the far future? Images? Movies? Ideas? A suspicion? A compulsion? A hunch? How will people know what are their own thoughts and what has been placed there from the outside? I look forward to the stories and shows that illustrate new ideas, and warn us of the dark pitfalls.</p>

October 16, 2020 | http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/10base5/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/10base5/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I can hardly claim to have worked professionally with 10BASE5 as when I first started building my own 10BASE2 networks in 1997, 10BASE5 was long obsolete. Back then, I knew about 10BASE5, but it wasn’t practical, affordable or interesting enough for me to attempt building one.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012, and 10BASE5 is now truly a vintage technology. Anyone studying something&nbsp;I.T. related likely will at some point have been told about this stuff, because it’s very important in the history of computing. This was the first standardised, commercially used form of Ethernet, and today, almost the entire Internet is Ethernet, but heck, who’s ever actually seen a working 10BASE5 setup? Not me, that’s for sure, nor or anyone I’ve ever met.</p>
<p>So… can I build a working setup in 2012? Read on…</p>

<p>I’ve written this page primarily for people like myself, who came into the computing scene just a bit too late to have ever seen this technology in use. A 1980s network engineer can safely skip this page.</p>

<p>In order to connect to a true 10BASE5 network, network adapters with AUI are required. AUI stands for Attachment Unit Interface. It is in effect, a media independent form of all of the physical 10Mbit ethernet variants, which I shall call 10BASE-X. AUI was to 10BASE-X what MII is to 100BASE-X, with the exception that MII is rarely found as an external connector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for this project, networking equipment with external AUI connectors is becoming rather difficult to find.</p>
<p>As I see it, there’s 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build true 10BASE5 nodes using equipment natively supporting AUI</li>
<li>Bridge to something else i.e. 10BASE-T</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building true 10BASE5 nodes</h2>
<p>Not many options remain for connecting to modern PCs. Here’s a few:</p>
<h3>ISA Cards</h3>
<p>While this can be done, modern mainboards with ISA slots are niche and very expensive. I ruled out this option.</p>
<p><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg" alt="3c509" width="717" height="453" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509.jpg 717w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509-150x95.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3c509-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p>

<h3>PCI Cards</h3>
<p>Fortunately, some modern PCs still have 32-Bit/5 volt parallel PCI slots, also, PCI and 10BASE5 had enough overlap that a small number of products were manufactured. A couple of examples are the 3Com 3C900B-COMBO, and 3C905B-COMBO. At the time of writing there were a fair few of these on eBay, but often for outrageous sums of money. Fortunately I managed to pick up a couple for a few quid. 64-Bit Windows drivers do not exist, making Windows 7 32-bit likely the last version of Windows able to make use of them, short of writing some new drivers. All versions of Linux will work OK with these.</p>

Using a 3Com 3c905B-COMBO NIC with AUI</figcaption></figure>
<h3>USB or other solutions</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell no USB product was ever made. With 10BASE5 MAU’s requiring 12 volts and some 5 or more watts of power, over and above what USB can provide, this would be a problematic proposition. Also, no single chip “USB with AUI” solutions exist. From my research, it seems theoretically possible to create a 2-chip adapter, with external power supply, but apparently there is no market for such as a thing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_71" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71"><a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/usbaui/"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-800x534.jpg" alt="USB AUI Ethernet adapter proof of concept, based on a D-Link DUB-E100, NQ8502 connected to MII" width="474" height="316" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-800x534.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-150x100.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn-300x200.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/axaui_proto_tn.jpg 880w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71">A D-Link DUB-E100 with its 100BASE-TX PHY removed, and an NQ8502 frankensteined in its place.<br> This image illustrates my key design objective: To give an AUI interface to a USB Ethernet MAC, instead of converting from 10BASE-T.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But that didn’t stop me from building one. Above is what is quite possibly one of the worlds only USB Ethernet Adapters with AUI interface. I have a seperate project page for this&nbsp;<a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/usbaui/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Routers</h3>
<p>A Cisco NM-1E2W module could be used if one has a large ISR kicking around.</p>
<h2>Bridging 10BASE5 to modern twisted pair networks</h2>
<h3>10BASE-T Hubs equipped with AUI</h3>
<p>Using a 10BASE-T hub with AUI to bridge to a twisted pair network is probably the easiest approach. There’s thousands of these for sale on eBay for peanuts, but in my case, having one of these on each node would make the setup rather clunky.</p>
<h3>10BASE-T to AUI Media converters</h3>
<p>What I was really looking for was a few of these little boxes. Easily mistaken for a 10BASE-T MAU, these (unlike the former which tend to be spilling out of every I.T. junk box in the land) are fairly uncommon.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17"><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-800x475.jpg" alt="Allied Telesis MC12T" width="474" height="281" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-800x475.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-150x89.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T-300x178.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MC12T.jpg 872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17">An Allied Telesis MC12T next to an ordinary 10BASE-T MAU. Spot the difference?</figcaption></figure>

<p>To keep the cost of this project to a minimum, I decided my network would only have 3-4 nodes as this was sufficient to demonstrate a proper shared media network as opposed to a 2 node effective “point to point” link. For this I sourced the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x 3Com 3C900B-COMBO PCI NICs with AUI</li>
<li>3x MiLAN MIL-130A AUI-to-10BASE-T bridges</li>
<li>1x MiLAN MIL-10P 10BASE-T Transceiver (for testing AUI nodes)</li>
<li>1x Allied Telesis MC12T</li>
<li>6x Cabletron ST-500 MAU’s</li>
<li>3x AMP 228752-1 Vampire taps</li>
<li>2x AMP 221914-1 Intrusive N connector taps</li>
<li>5x AUI Drop cables</li>
<li>15M of Belden #9880 cable</li>
<li>2x 50ohm N terminators</li>
<li>2x N female to female couplers</li>
<li>10x UNC 4-40 x 1.1/2″ countersunk screws (to replace missing ones on my MAUs)</li>
</ul>

<p>A common belief persists that 10BASE5 used RG-8/U cable. This, for the most part, appears to be untrue. The cable used was purpose designed for 10BASE5 and manufactured by Belden under the part number 9880 (A few other compatible cables may exist). The reason #9880 cable was specified is that several variants of RG-8 exist with varying dimensions and manufacturing standards. Given that the main form of connection of MAU’s to 10BASE5 networks was by the precisely designed prongs in “Vampire taps”, cable dimensions and dielectric consistency had to be spot on.</p>
<p>A network designed using only intrusive N connector taps such as AMP 221914-1 could get away with using pretty much any 50 ohm coax, but then the sum total of insertion losses created by each node may prevent the full 500M segment length from being achieved. Also, this approach wouldn’t permit addition of new nodes without bringing down the network. After an evening of wrestling with RG-8/U cable (why oh why didn’t I just buy RG-58) while attempting to make a short test lead, I think I’ll stick with the Vampire Taps.</p>
<p>For someone like me who hadn’t encountered it before, no amount of looking at pictures could prepare for how big this stuff is. Short of high power transmission cables, it’s the largest coaxial cable I’ve ever seen. It is also very heavy, rigid and the bend radius is absurdly large.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of this cable is the black bands which appear every 2.5M. In 10BASE5 networks, MAUs can only be attached at 2.5M intervals, this is to ensure that signal reflections generated by taps stay out of phase, which stops them compounding across the whole segment. In a small network such as mine, it’s probably not so important to respect this tap placement rule, but I’ll respect it anyway.</p>

Either side of this frame is 10 kilos of steel, about the minimum required to hold this stuff down for the photo</figcaption></figure>

<p>Unlike the BNC connectors found on 10BASE2, the official connector used by 10BASE5 (where connectors are required) is the N connector. While still used extensively in lab/specialist environments, this large coaxial connector isn’t something the average ‘tech dude’ is likely to encounter these days. They perform exceptionally, have an intrinsic impedance of 50 ohms, are fairly common/inexpensive and easily handle the large sized #9880 cable.</p>

<p>These cables sporting male and female 15-pin D-sub connectors, connect a node to the MAU. Since the MAU is bolted to a rigid behemoth piece of coax, it wasn’t exactly convenient to try and drag that lot down to the back of a PC, so these cables bridged that gap. With a maximum length of 50 metres, that gap can be very large indeed. Also, given that taps could only be placed at 2.5M intervals, a world without drop cables would lend its self to much humour around the office, at the expense of well-intended PC and desk placement considerations.</p>
<p>One notable feature is the slide locking mechanism used in place of the usual UNC 4-40 screws. It is my personal opinion that the design of this mechanism is a bit daft. In theory it’s a good idea but in practice I think it was implemented too flimsily. AUI drop cables are often very large and rigid (likely thanks to a half a dozen layers of shielding), so much so that a mild sideways nudge on a cable can easily rip a latched connector straight out of the socket, bending/breaking the mechanism. They also have a feature that the screws in the female end often work their way out over time, inevitably to be lost forever. Even during this small scale project, I have suffered some grief over these locking mechanisms. I can imagine they were a source of many support calls in the 80s and early 90s.</p>

<p>These metal boxes are one of the key defining pieces of kit in a 10BASE5 network. They function as the transceiver, converting the primitive signals from the AUI interface to what’s required on the physical media, as well as performing collision detection. They came in 4 flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using a Vampire Tap</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using N connectors (Rare)</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE2 networks, using BNC connectors</li>
<li>Without a tap (Buy your own)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose Cabletron ST-500’s, because they have blinky lights. The ST-500 (90 Series) would have been one of the last and most modern 10BASE5 MAUs manufactured. The internal component count (when compared with, say, a DEC h4000) is low.</p>

<p>By far the most common means of connection to the coax segment. The bottom half is plastic, I assume to eliminate ground loops by ensuring the braid remains electrically isolated from the metal case of the MAU. The top half is extruded aluminium. Each contains three prongs (two to connect to the braid, and one to the centre conductor). To me, the idea of using this style of connection to coaxial cable is ambitious, but it has to be said that a few spikes in a coaxial cable will equate to significantly less reflection and insertion loss …</p></div></div>

</em></p>
<p><em>(This is an edited and expanded version of a talk I gave in Trento, Italy in June 2018, on a panel <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-digital-currency-wont-save-us">with Sheila Dow</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The topic today is “Digital currencies: threat or opportunity?”</p>
<p>I’d like to offer a third alternative: New digital currencies like bitcoin are neither a threat or an opportunity. They do not raise any interesting economic questions and do not pose any significant policy problems. They do not represent any kind of technological advance on existing payment systems, which are of course already digital. They are just another asset bubble, based on the usual mix of fraud and fantasy. By historical standards, they are not a very large or threatening bubble. There is nothing important about them at all.</p>
<p>Why might you conclude that the new digital currencies don’t matter?</p>
<p>– Aggregate size – the total value of all bitcoin is on the order of $200 billion, other digital currencies are much smaller. On the scale of modern financial markets that’s not much more than a rounding error.</p>
<p>– No articulation with the rest of the financial system. No banks or other important institutions rely on cryptocurrencies to settle transactions, or have substantial holdings on their balance sheets. They’re not used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>– Not used to structure real activity. No significant part of collective productive or reproductive activity is organized by making payments or taking positions in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Besides that, these currencies don’t even do what they claim to do. In practice, digital currencies do depend on intermediaries. Payment is inconvenient and expensive — as much as $14 per transaction, and accepted by only 3 of top 500 online retailers. And markets in these currencies are not decentralized, but dominated by a few big players. All this is documented in Mike Beggs’ wonderful <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-monetary-system">Jacobin article on cryptocurrencies</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Compare this to the mortgage market. Total residential mortgages in the US are over $13 trillion, not far short of GDP. The scale is similar in many other countries. Mortgages are a key asset for the financial system, even when not securitized. And of course they play a central role in organizing the provision of housing (and commercial space), an absolutely essential function to social reproduction.</p>
<p>And yet here we are talking about cryptocurrencies. Why?</p>
<p>Partly it’s just hard money crankery and libertarianism, which have a outsized voice in economics discussions. And partly it’s testimony to the success of their marketing machine. One might say that the only thing that stands behind that $200 billion value, is the existence of conversations like this one.</p>
<p>But it’s not just cranks and libertarians who care about cryptocurrencies. Central bank research departments are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-cenbank-idUSKBN26Z2R0">earnestly exploring</a> the development of digital currencies. This disproportionate attention reflects, I think, some deeper problems with how we think of money and central banking. The divide over whether crypto-currencies represent anything new or important reflects a larger divide over how we conceive of the monetary system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/dont-start-from-coin/">language of Schumpeter</a> — whose discussion in his <em>History of Economic Thought</em> remains perhaps the best starting point for thinking about these things — it comes down to whether we “start from the coin.” If we start from the coin, if we think of money as a distinct tangible thing, a special kind of asset, then bitcoin may look important. We could call this the quantity view of money. But if we follow Schumpeter — and in different ways Hyman Minsky, Perry Mehrling and David Graeber — and start from balance sheets, then it won’t. Call this the ledger view of money.</p>
<p>In the quantity view, “money” is something special. The legal monopoly of governments on printing currency is very important, because that is money in a way that other assets aren’t. Credit created by banks is something different. Digital currencies are a threat or opportunity, as the case may be, because they seem to also go in this exclusive “outside money” box.</p>
<p>But from the Minsky-Mehrling-Graeber point of view, there’s nothing special about outside money. It’s just another set of tokens for recording changes in the social ledger. What matters isn’t the way that changes are recorded, but the accounts themselves. From this perspective, “money” isn’t an asset, a thing, it is simply the arbitrary units in which ledgers are kept and contracts denominated.</p>
<p>The starting point, from this point of view, is a network of money payments and commitments. Some of these commitments structure real activity (I show up for work because I expect to receive a wage). Others are free-standing. (I pay you interest because I owe you a debt.) In either case money is simply a unit of account. I have made a promise to you, you have a made a promise to someone else; these promises are in some cases commitments to specific concrete activities (to show up for work and do what you’re told), but in other cases they are quantitative, measured as a certain quantity of “money.”</p>
<p>What does money mean here? Simply whatever will be accepted as fulfilment of the promise, as specified in whatever legal or quasi-legal provisions govern it. It is entirely possible for the unit of account to have no concrete existence at all. And in any case the concrete assets that will be accepted are never identical; their equivalence is to some extent a fiction enshrined in the terms of the contract, and to some extent the result of active interventions by whatever authorities are responsible for the payments system.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that some particular asset that serves as money in this or that case is not very interesting. What matters is the balance sheets. Money is just a means of recording changes on balance sheets, of making transfers between ledgers. If we take the ledger view, then there’s no difference between physical currency and an instrument like a check. In either case the social ledger maintained by the banking system has a certain credit to you. You want to transfer a part of that to someone else, for whatever reason. So you give that person a piece of paper with the amount written on it, and they take it to their bank, which adjusts the social ledger accordingly. It makes no difference whether the piece of paper is a dollar or euro bill or a check or a money order, any more than it matters what its physical dimensions are or whether it is one sheet of paper or two.</p>
<p>And of course the majority of transactions are made, the majority of obligations, are settled without using pieces of paper at all. In fact the range of transactions you can carry out using the pieces of paper we call “money” is rather limited.</p>
<p>To put it another way: At the train station there are various machines, which will give you a piece of paper while debiting your bank account. Some of those pieces of paper can be used in exchange for a train ride, others for various other purposes. We call one a ticket machine and one an ATM. But conceptually we should think of them as the same kind of machine. Both debit your social ledger and then give you a claim on something concrete — a paper from the newsstand, say, or a train ride, as the case may be.</p>
<p>In the quantity view of money, there is some special asset called money which the rest of the payments system builds off. So the fact that something else could “be” money seems important. It matters that the government has a legal monopoly on printing currency, so it also matters that something like cryptocurrency seems to evade that monopoly. In the ledger view, on the other hand, that legal monopoly doesn’t matter at all. There are lots of systems for making transfers between bank accounts, including many purely electronic ones. And there are social ledgers maintained by institutions that we don’t officially recognize as banks. New digital currencies introduce a few more of each. So what?</p>
<p>In the quantity view, money and credit are two distinct things. We start with money, which might then be lent. This is how we learn it as children. In the ledger view, money is just anything that settles an obligation. And that is constantly done by promises or IOUs. The fact that “banks create money” in our modern economy isn’t some kind of innovation out of an original situation of cash-on-the-barrelhead exchange. Rather, it is a restriction of money-creation from the historical situation where third-party IOUs of all kinds circulated as payment.</p>
<p>Related to this are two different views of central banks. In the quantity view, the fundamental role of the central bank is in some sense setting or managing the money supply. In the ledger view, where money is just an arbitrary subset of payments media, which is constantly being created and destroyed in the course of making payments, “the money supply” is a nonsense term. What central banks are doing in this view is controlling the elasticity of the credit system. In other words, they are managing the willingness and ability of economic units to make promises to each other.</p>
<p>There are a variety of objectives in this; two important ones today are to control the pace of real activity via the elasticity of money commitments (e.g. to <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/federal-reserve-interest-rate-increase-janet-yellen-inflation-unemployment/">keep the wage share within certain bounds</a> by controlling the level of aggregate employment) and to maintain the integrity of the payments system in a crisis where a wave of self-perpetuating defaults is possible.</p>
<p>In either case the thing which the central bank seeks to make more scarce or abundant is not the quantity of some asset labeled as “money”, but the capacity to make promises. To reduce the level of real activity, for example, the central bank needs to make it more difficult for economic units to make claims on real resources on the basis of promises of future payments. To avoid or resolve a crisis the central bank needs to increase the trustworthiness of units so they can settle outstanding obligations by making new promises; alternatively it can substitute its …</p></div></article></div>

<h5>2,079,471 stars</h5>
<p>
To strike fear in the computing world, just whisper "traveling salesman problem."
The echo will be <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-quantum-computing-is-changing-the-world-three-israelis-are-leading-the-revolution-1.8530603">"if we want to figure out the route for 28 cities, the universe will die before we get the result."</a>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the reputation of the problem is such that advances on small instances (using admittedly cool technology) are newsworthy, such as recent reports on a new AI <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30655520/scientists-solve-traveling-salesman-problem/">"processor to solve 22 cities"</a> or an 8-stop tour found by an ameoba <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a25686417/amoeba-math/">"that might just change the face of computing forever"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our work is decidedly less exotic, but at a much, much larger scale.
With <a href="http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/">Keld Helsgaun</a>, from Roskilde University in Denmark, we aim to compute the shortest-possible tour through the <a href="http://www.mpia.de/~calj/tgas_distances/main.html">3D positions of over two million individual stars</a>, a point set based on the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-1">ESA Gaia Data Release 1</a>.
</p>


<h5>28,884,352 parsecs</h5>
<p>
From October 2017 through October 2019, week by week, we produced shorter and shorter 3D star tours, employing an array of heuristic-search techniques and ever-increasing amounts of computing power.
The foundation for this effort was Keld's <a href="http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/">LKH</a> software package, a powerhouse code for obtaining near-optimal solutions to the TSP and related routing problems. 
On top of LKH, we added methods specialized for such a large data set, combining local search and genetic algorithms, together with decomposition strategies to allow for parallel computation.
</p>

<p>
The search continued through the end of last year, but we found no further improvements on a solution from October 6, 2019.
That's the tour displayed in the moving image.
Its total length is 28,884,352.4 parsecs, or, if you prefer, 94,208,157.5 light years.
</p>


<h5>0.0000074 guarantee</h5>
<p>
A crucial point is this is not just any route through the stars.
Ours comes together with a proof that its length, if not the absolute shortest possible, is off by at most a factor of 0.0000074.
To put this in perspective, it's like a New York to Los Angles road trip guaranteed to be within half a city block of the optimal cross-country drive.
</p>

<p>
Our quality guarantee is provided by another difficult computation.
Over the past two-and-a-half years we have been running a linear programming, cutting-plane method to slowly close the gap between our solution and a lower bound on the length of each of the unimaginably many possible tours through the point set.
Our work here builds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde TSP Solver</a>, again making numerous adjustments to handle the expectionally large number of points and to permit extensive parallel computation.
</p>

<h5>Parsecs to dollars</h5>
<p>
We know there is no tour more than 213.4 parsecs shorter than our route.
Close enough for Jean-Luc Picard, perhaps, but attacks on closing the remaining gap may lead to mathematical techniques having wide application beyond the world of Star Trek. 
If you think you can help, I'm offering a bounty of $50 for each parsec you can save by rearranging the flight through the stars.
It would aid our work to have an improved target tour if one exists, so I'm happy to offer a reward to encourage more eyes on the data set.
</p>

<p>
And don't worry about the budget.
Keld and I won $17,000 in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/overview">Kaggle competition</a> last year; I put some of my share aside to payoff any shortcut finders.

<p>Hello! 👋  My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>It was never part of my life goals to start my own company, let alone a company of one. In fact, if you had asked me before I actually took the leap if this was within the realm of possibility, I would have said <em>hell freakin’ no.</em></p>

<p>To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it even after I started working on Lunch Money. It was only after I saw success during launch that I decided to quit my freelancing jobs to pursue this endeavour full-time.</p>

<p>So why the 180-degree change? Upon reflection, I realized that the aggregate of my life and work experience made this a sensible decision and allowed me to transition easily into the role. I feel that I was ready for something like this for some time, but I had learned to be picky with what I spend my effort on and the right project never came up until Lunch Money. <strong>In this article, I will go into 4 specific life and career decisions that I consider foundational to my solopreneurship journey.</strong></p>



<p>I had never given much thought to how important transferrable skills were until I realized that simply being a software engineer at any tech company in the Bay Area did not result in more-or-less the same set of experiences and skills.</p>

<p>A friend told me a story of how working at [unnamed large software company] simplified a lot of processes for the sake of moving quickly. For instance, databases could be spun up via one-click deploy coupled with homegrown configuration files for adjustments. They’d later on realize as they were job hunting that setting up a data store was not so straight forward, but all the difficult parts had been abstracted out and they never got the chance to peek under the hood.</p>

<p>Consider two internships I had during my college years. The first was at Qualcomm– a large well-known international company with decades of proven engineering expertise. The second was a small seed-funded start-up of 3 founders, another intern and myself that had recently pivoted and hadn’t found their product market fit yet.</p>

<p>Granted that Qualcomm is in a totally different field of embedded software and hardware engineering, a lot of the tech I worked with was proprietary. I learned virtually no transferrable hard skills during my double-term internship at Qualcomm.</p>

<p>At the smaller (now defunct) start-up, I learned how to use Github. I worked with open source projects for the first time. I learned how to communicate with clients as I was building apps for them. I learned how to think about web versus mobile design. I learned a ton of Javascript. These are all skillsets I am still tapping into today.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable!</p>



<p>I feel strongly that working on three different teams at Twitter helped me gain experience critical to running Lunch Money on my own today. I stayed on each team for roughly 1 year, having made significant impact before moving onto the next.</p>

<p>I started on Observability which was responsible for building a monitoring tool for internal use. I was specifically hired to work on the front-end side of things so I had full autonomy over the UI and UX of these dashboards.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/observability.png" alt=""> <span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2013/observability-at-twitter.html" target="_blank">source</a></span><span>I designed and implemented data visualization and monitoring systems using Ruby on Rails and backbone.js at Twitter</span></p>

<p>I would have probably stayed on longer if it weren’t for my manager and another team that was looking to “borrow” an engineer for some high priority growth initiatives. My manager volunteered me and I was excited to work on a public-facing project for once. Little did I know there was a breakdown in communication and the receiving team, hearing that I was coming from “Platform Engineering”, assumed that I was a backend and Scala wiz.</p>

<p>Despite my initial uneasiness, I tapped into my “fake it til you make it” mentality and I learned Scala on the job. It wasn’t easy going from Javascript to a strongly-typed language but with a few late nights and the help of some very patient engineers, I was able to ship a couple of high impact features. I also ended up being the sole backend engineer supporting the new user onboarding process during the World Cup.</p>

<p>I later switched to the messaging team (working on SMS, push notifications and email) where I rewrote from scratch the entire infrastructure that interpreted text messages.</p>

<p>All in all, I left Twitter with an incredible breadth and depth of experience– having worked up and down the stack, in both existing codebases and greenfield projects, on my own and under the watchful eye of staff engineers. I gained an unreal amount of confidence in my engineering skills and more importantly, my ability to learn a new technology quickly.</p>



<p>In my early 20s, I got really into electronic dance music (EDM). I found myself going out dancing most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Since San Francisco was home to numerous clubs, it became a chore to discover events. You basically had to go to each individual venue’s (often janky) website and navigate their calendars to find what was coming up. From there, specific event details were either on Facebook or ticketing platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketfly, etc.</p>

<p>I later found out from a friend that there used to be a popular site that aggregated all EDM events in the Bay Area until it eventually shut down. I thought this was a fantastic idea and well within my technical scope so I got to work.</p>

<p>I hammered out a minimal viable product (MVP) with Ruby on Rails (thanks to having learned this on the job at Twitter). The MVP was basically a one-pager with a list of manually-inserted events for the next 2 weeks. I started to tell my friends about the site and it quickly proved invaluable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro1.png" alt=""> <span>The first iteration of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>Fuelled by passion, I poured hours of effort every week into growing my site. I learned to incorporate the Gracenote API which would label each event with the specific genre of EDM. The Eventbrite and Ticketfly APIs helped automate adding new event details. I implemented a form where promoters could suggest upcoming shows. I started a Facebook page which grew to hundreds of followers. I sent out weekly emails via Mailchimp and made a few bucks every month with affiliate ads.</p>

<p>Over the course of several months, word of mouth continued to spread and my site ultimately peaked at 1000 weekly active users.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro2.png" alt="">
<span>The second and last redesign of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>The coolest part (which I’ve yet to re-experience with Lunch Money) was when I met someone at a show. I asked them if they had heard of my site and they pulled up their phone to show me it was the last site they had visited. That blew my mind!</p>

<p>The eventual fade of my interest in EDM also meant the end of futuraretro. While it didn’t get anywhere significant, I strengthened my muscle of “learning by doing”. Since then, I’ve started a number of other micro-sites spawned from short-lived curiosities and interests. My first few projects did not end up being the breakthrough ones but they helped me get used to putting myself out there and launching things.</p>



<p>Moving out of San Francisco permanently and subsequently taking a sabbatical helped strip away the biases that were stemming from my environment. If you were to ask me when I was living in San Francisco my motivations for wanting to start a company, my honest answer would probably be related to boosting my ego, gaining clout among my Silicon Valley peers, or making a ton of money so I could afford a little condo in the Mission.</p>

<p><a href="https://lunchbag.ca/pre-departure-thoughts/">I took significant time off to travel in 2017</a>. I sought after experiences I knew I would never come across otherwise such as spending time <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/thailand/">in various abodes in Northeastern Thailand</a> and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/lunchbag-in-france-living-in-the-mountains/">the French countryside</a>. Being in new and unfamiliar environments helped me see almost right away that I wanted to end up in Toronto. I was reminded of the other joys in life– family, nature and community, and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/checking-in-things-i-ve-learned/">I gained clarity on myself</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/sabbatical.jpg" alt=""><span>Pure joy in the Burgundy countryside where I spent 5 weeks as a bartender and waitress at a French restaurant</span></p>

<p>It may seem drastic, but leaving behind all my comforts was my big ‘ah ha!’ moment. I don’t think it changed me as a person, rather, it allowed me to recalibrate for my desired life path without external influences.</p>

<p>Now that I have a better footing on my goals and values, I am rebuilding my life around that and I couldn’t be happier. See, if I wanted to make a bunch of money and make a name for myself, I would not be a solopreneur. Solopreneurship optimizes for freedom first, not money. And right now, running Lunch Money as a company of one while living in Taipei is exactly where I want to be.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  <p>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein's_thought_experiments">logic puzzle science</a>, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is – the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? – but they don’t really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>There are two halves of relativity as Einstein developed it: special relativity and general relativity.</p>

<p>Special relativity is, at heart, two ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The laws of physics are the same to everyone everywhere, as long as they are using a non-accelerating (“inertial”) frame of reference.</li>
  <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same regardless of frame of reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Einstein, these two things were widely considered to be paradoxical: how could it be that the speed of light is constant for everyone – its velocity is not added to your velocity, if you are moving – but also physics doesn’t depend on your perspective? What Einstein did was take both of these things seriously and realized that when you put them together, you get a space-time connection and lot of other really powerful stuff.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">time dilation</a> immediately falls out. Imagine that you are standing on the platform of a train station while a train flies past, and your friend is onboard the train. If your friend puts a mirror on the ceiling of the train car and, lying on the floor, points a flashlight at it, he will see the light reflected back at him having gone up in a straight line and returned in a straight line to the floor. However, from your perspective on the platform, while the light is traveling up and down, it is also traveling sideways. This means the path it travels is <em>longer</em> than the path it appears to travel to your friend. Since the speed of light is constant, and the distance between the floor and the ceiling don’t change, from your perspective, time must be passing more slowly for your friend than for you. And indeed this is an experimentally tested real effect! (For example, you need to take it into account for GPS to work reliably.) It is important to note that your friend, on the train, never feels anything different: from their perspective, time is passing just fine at the same rate it always does. The effect is entirely about the difference in your perspectives.</p>

<p>The idea that the laws of physics are the same of everyone is sometimes called “general covariance” and is really important for the tractability of a description of physics overall. There isn’t necessarily a guarantee that it would be true in our universe, but it turns out that it is.</p>

<p>General relativity adds one more idea: when an observer is using an accelerating (“non-inertial”) frame of reference, the laws of physics might appear to be different, and that difference shows up as a gravitational field.</p>

<p>For example, if you are in a car accelerating on the highway and you throw a ball into the air, it will veer towards the back of the car. You know that this is because the car is accelerating - but it is also completely equivalent to model this as a gravitational field coming from the back of a non-accelerating car! In fact, the equivalence principle says that if you were in a windowless box that was either being accelerated by a rope or is in the presence of a gravitational field, there is no measurement you could make that would tell them apart.</p>

<p>The language of physics is math, and so while it’s easy to get the big ideas that underlie relativity, getting the full depth of the implications requires going to the equations. The math of special relativity is mostly pretty easy – you can get surprisingly far with high school level math – but general relativity is a completely different beast, and one of the reasons Einstein’s original GR papers are so challenging is because the math really required to do it well (e.g. differential geometry) didn’t exist at the time. Einstein had the realization that the universe has no sense of coordinates, just a way of measuring distances between events, which he described as “no prior geometry,” but it took a while for the full mathematical description of what this actually meant to be worked out.</p>

<p>Anyway, relativity is incredibly trippy and fascinating, so if you’ve liked this sneak peek I highly recommend checking out Einstein’s short 1916 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity:_The_Special_and_the_General_Theory">“Relativity: The Special and the General Theory”</a> which is written for laypeople and uses very little math while still walking you through the core of it all with Einstein’s unique incisive clarity. General relativity is certainly one of the most beautiful things in all of science (possibly <em>the</em> most; quantum field theory is very cool too, though it lacks the intrinsic elegance of GR), and I wish more people had the chance to understand and appreciate it.</p>

With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it.

Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot.

<p>This post details my adventures with the Linux virtual memory subsystem, and my discovery of a creative way to taunt the OOM (out of memory) killer by accumulating memory in the kernel, rather than in userspace.</p>



<p>Keep reading and you’ll learn:</p>



<ul><li>Internal details of the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation</li><li>How to exploit virtual memory to implement highly efficient sparse data structures</li><li>What page tables are and how to calculate the memory overhead incurred by them</li><li>A cute way to get killed by the OOM killer while appearing to consume very little memory (great for parties)</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Demand paging is nuanced</h2>



<p>As usual, the story begins with me asking questions about implementation details. This time, about the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation.</p>



<p>In Operating Systems 101 we learn that operating systems are “lazy” when they allocate memory to processes. When you mmap() an anonymous page, the kernel slyly returns a pointer immediately. It then waits until you trigger a page fault by “touching” that memory before doing the real memory allocation work. This is called “demand paging”.</p>



<p>This is efficient — if the memory is never touched, no physical memory is ever allocated. This also means you can allocate virtual memory in vast excess of what is physically available (“overcommit”), which can be useful.<span id="easy-footnote-1-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-496" title="Some examples of applications that allocate immense virtual memory are Address Sanitizer and Webkit."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. You just can’t touch it all.</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper. Barring execution, “touching” memory means reading or writing. Writes to a new mmap’d region require the kernel to perform a full memory allocation. You need memory, you need it <em>now</em>, and the kernel can’t push it off any longer.</p>



<p>Now, the question: <strong>What about reads?</strong></p>



<p>Unlike writes, reads to a new mmap’d region do <em>not</em> trigger a memory allocation. The kernel continues to push off the allocation by exploiting how new anonymous mappings must be zero initialized. Instead of allocating memory, the kernel services the page fault using the “zero page”: a pre-allocated page of physical memory, completely filled with zeros. In theory this is “free” — a single physical frame can back all zero-initialized pages.</p>



<p>The point? <strong>Demand paging is nuanced — not all ways of accessing a new mapping require the kernel to allocate memory</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s see what this looks like in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/memory.c#L4191">source</a>. The core page fault handler, <code>handle_mm_fault</code> is in <code>mm/memory.c</code>. A few calls deep via <code>__handle_mm_fault</code> and <code>handle_pte_fault</code>, we hit this block:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t handle_pte_fault(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...

	if (!vmf-&gt;pte) {
		if (vma_is_anonymous(vmf-&gt;vma))
			return do_anonymous_page(vmf);
		else
			// ...
	}

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Which leads us to <code>do_anonymous_page</code> — the core page fault handler for anonymous pages. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t do_anonymous_page(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...
	
	if (pte_alloc(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd))
		return VM_FAULT_OOM;
	// ...

	/* Use the zero-page for reads */
	if (!(vmf-&gt;flags &amp; FAULT_FLAG_WRITE) &amp;&amp; // (1)
			!mm_forbids_zeropage(vma-&gt;vm_mm)) {
		entry = pte_mkspecial(pfn_pte(my_zero_pfn(vmf-&gt;address), // (2)
						vma-&gt;vm_page_prot));
		vmf-&gt;pte = pte_offset_map_lock(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd,
				vmf-&gt;address, &amp;vmf-&gt;ptl);
		// ...
		goto setpte;
	}
	// ...
setpte:
	set_pte_at(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;address, vmf-&gt;pte, entry); // (3)
	// ...
	return ret;

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Bingo. It checks whether a read caused the fault (1), then maps the virtual page to the zero page (2 and 3).</p>



<p>Note that this all happens in the page fault handler, which is an implementation choice. The mmap <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/mmap.c#L1687">core logic</a> does not touch the page tables at all, and only records the presence of the new mapping. It leaves the mapping’s page table entry non-present (present bit = 0) which will trigger a page fault on access.</p>



<p>Alternatively, mmap could proactively allocate the page table entry, and initialize it to the zero page. This would avoid a page fault on the first read, but at the cost of initializing (potentially many) page table entries up front. Given that it’s most efficient to be maximally lazy, the current implementation is best.</p>



<h2>Part 2: Allocating infinite memory, and touching it too</h2>



<p>This led me to another question. Since reads from anonymous mappings are “free”, in addition to allocating excessive virtual memory, can’t you actually touch all of it? As long as that “touch” is a read?</p>



<p>Time for an experiment. Here’s some code that allocates 100 GB of linear memory, and tries to read from the first byte of each page. It allocates 512 MB at a time because I <a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy/status/1317676450393300994">incorrectly thought</a> you couldn’t mmap 100GB at once <s>you can’t directly ask mmap for 100 GB 🙂</s>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-496" title="Thanks to <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/damageboy&quot;>@damageboy</a> for pointing this out."><sup>2</sup></a></span><span id="easy-footnote-3-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-496" title="This is lazy, dirty research code :) It is not sound or portable, and only just works because Linux happens to place the mmaps contiguously, growing down in memory."><sup>3</sup></a></span> My test system was a x64 Ubuntu 20.04 VPS.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

const size_t MB = 1024 * 1024;
const size_t GB = MB * 1024;

int main() {
  size_t alloc_size = 512 * MB;
  size_t total_alloc = 100 * GB;
  size_t num_allocs = total_alloc / alloc_size;

  // std::cout &lt;&lt; "alloc_size (MB)" &lt;&lt; alloc_size / (1024*1024)&lt;&lt; "\n";

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Allocating mem...\n";

  char* base = nullptr;

  // Allocate a ton of memory
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; num_allocs; i++) {
    // Unsound alert - assuming allocations are contiguous and grow down.
    base = (char*)mmap(NULL, alloc_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    if (base == MAP_FAILED) {
      perror(NULL);
      throw std::runtime_error("Fail");
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (void*)base &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
  }

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Allocated Virtual Mem (GB): " &lt;&lt; total_alloc / GB &lt;&lt; "\n";
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Base Addr: " &lt;&lt; (void*)base &lt;&lt; "\n";
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Press enter to start reading.\n";
  getchar();
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Reading each page...\n";

  // Read the first byte of each page
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; total_alloc; i += 0x1000) {
    auto x = base[i];
  }

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Done!\n";
  getchar();
}</code></pre></div>



<p>When we run it, here’s what we see:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Bash"><code>$ ./demo

<p>htop confirms that 100 GB of virtual memory is allocated (VIRT column), but a much more reasonable 1540 KB of resident memory (RES) is actually occupying RAM. Note the MINFLT column — this is the number of “minor” page faults that have occurred. A minor page fault is one that does not require loading from disk. We will be triggering lots of these and should expect to see this number grow dramatically.</p>



<p>Here’s what happens after I press enter to trigger reading.</p>



<div><pre><code>0x7f26cd300000 198

Press enter to start reading.

Done!</code></pre></div>



<p>The process hits the “Done!” print. This means it successfully touched every page of the 100 GB allocation!</p>

<p>htop confirms that many minor faults have occurred. We would expect it to cause exactly 26214400 faults (100 GB / 4 KB), and indeed, 26214552 – 26214400 = 152, the number we started with. Intriguingly, the resident memory appears to have also increased, which should not have happened. See the <a href="#rss-spike">Appendix A</a> for discussion of this.</p>



<p>Here’s a video to see it all in action:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Allocating 100 GB and touching it all (Demand Paging Pt 1)" width="625" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYNMt6FWsI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>So the theory is confirmed! You can apparently “Allocate your memory, and touch it too” (as long as that touch is a read).</strong><span id="easy-footnote-4-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-496" title="Or if you prefer, the famous Henry Ford <a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/23494-any-customer-can-have-a-car-painted-any-colour-that&quot;>quote</a>:  &amp;#8220;You can touch as much memory as you want, as long as you are only reading&amp;#8221;."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>If your application, for some reason, benefits from the ability to have a 100 GB array of zeros then this is perfect for you. What about the rest of us?</p>



<p>A closer-to-real-life application is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse array</a>. A sparse array is a (typically very large) array, whose elements are mostly zero. By exploiting demand paging, you can implement a memory efficient sparse array, where the majority of the array is backed by the zero page (or not even mapped). You get the fast indexing benefits of an array while avoiding the memory overhead.</p>



<h2>Part 3: Playing with a killer</h2>



<p>I have a confession. Remember when I said not all ways of accessing memory require the kernel to allocate memory? Yeah, that’s a lie.</p>



<p>Even though a read can be serviced by the shared zero page, that doesn’t mean no memory is allocated. Even the process of mapping a zero page requires allocating  memory. And here’s where we get into the nitty gritty.</p>



<h3>The hidden overhead of page tables</h3>



<p>The overhead comes from the virtual memory infrastructure itself — the page tables. Page tables are data structures that power the virtual memory subsystem. Like regular data structures, they occupy memory, only their overhead is easy to overlook, since it’s hidden from userspace.</p>



<p>This is what page tables on x86_64 look like:</p>

<p>They’re a tree data structure that is 4 levels deep, with each node (table) being an array of 512 8-byte entries. Together these tables offer an efficient way to represent a mapping between every virtual page in the address space and a physical frame.</p>



<p>Here’s where the overhead comes from. Each page touched requires 1 Page Table Entry (PTE) to be allocated. However, PTEs aren’t allocated individually. They’re allocated in blocks of 512 called Page Tables. Each Page Table requires 1 Page Directory Entry to be allocated. But …</p></div></div>
