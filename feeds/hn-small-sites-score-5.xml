<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]
// signature requires the request to have a `Content-Type`
fn multipart_upload(cont_type: &amp;ContentType, data: Data) -&gt; Result&lt;Stream&lt;Cursor&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;, Custom&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    // this and the next check can be implemented as a request guard but it seems like just
    // more boilerplate than necessary
    if !cont_type.is_form_data() {
        return Err(Custom(
            Status::BadRequest,
            "Content-Type not multipart/form-data".into()
        ));
    }

    let (_, boundary) = cont_type.params().find(|&amp;(k, _)| k == "boundary").ok_or_else(
            || Custom(
                Status::BadRequest,
                "`Content-Type: multipart/form-data` boundary param not provided".into()
            )
        )?;

    match process_upload(boundary, data) {
        Ok(resp) =&gt; Ok(Stream::from(Cursor::new(resp))),
        Err(err) =&gt; Err(Custom(Status::InternalServerError, err.to_string()))
    }
}

fn process_upload(boundary: &amp;str, data: Data) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    let mut out = Vec::new();

    // saves all fields, any field longer than 10kB goes to a temporary directory
    // Entries could implement FromData though that would give zero control over
    // how the files are saved; Multipart would be a good impl candidate though
    match Multipart::with_body(data.open(), boundary).save().temp() {
        Full(entries) =&gt; process_entries(entries, &amp;mut out)?,
        Partial(partial, reason) =&gt; {
            writeln!(out, "Request partially processed: {:?}", reason)?;
            if let Some(field) = partial.partial {
                writeln!(out, "Stopped on field: {:?}", field.source.headers)?;
            }

            process_entries(partial.entries, &amp;mut out)?
        },
        Error(e) =&gt; return Err(e),
    }

    Ok(out)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p><span>
    Outline has great UI
</span>
<img src="https://www.getoutline.com/images/screenshot.png"></p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>
<img src="http://chsasank.github.io/assets/images/outline/make_install.png"></p>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In JavaScript, you can create random numbers using <code>Math.random()</code>. But what if we wanted to create our own random values in the browser without this function?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-math.random">ECMAScript Language Specification</a> defines the requirements of <code>Math.random()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns a Number value with positive sign, greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1, chosen randomly or pseudo randomly with approximately uniform distribution over that range, using an implementation-dependent algorithm or strategy. This function takes no arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Math.random function created for distinct realms must produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="number-generation"><a href="#number-generation" aria-label="number generation permalink"></a>Number Generation</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of a number generator. It uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a> to maintain internal state and creates a sequence of numbers based off an initial seed value. Here the seed is fixed and is always initialized to <code>0</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Math<span>.</span>random <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> seed <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    seed <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> seed
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>


Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> 
Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> 
Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>A <strong>pseudorandom number generator</strong> (PRNG) works in a similar manner. A PRNG maintains an internal state and applies math to that state every time a new random number is requested. The seed can be manual or automatic. In the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#New">Go programming language</a>, you must seed <code>math/rand</code> yourself. In the browser, <code>Math.random</code> requests random data under the hood from the operating system (OS) to use as a seed.</p>
<p>PRNGs are deterministic. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Often, a deterministic outcome is preferred. For example, to generate the same random events on all clients without them having to talk over a network. Or for reproducible performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>A hash function can be used to create a PRNG. In <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/4b9b23521e6fd42373ebbcb20ebe03bf445494f9/benchmarks/spinning-balls/v.js">spinning-balls</a>, one of Chrome’s benchmarks, we can see an example of this:</p>

<p>Like our number generator, it alters its internal state while calculating the next random number. This state-change allows the next call to produce a different number.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators"><a href="#more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators" aria-label="more on pseudorandom number generators permalink"></a>More on Pseudorandom Number Generators</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and most well known types of PRNG is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG). Which, despite its somewhat scary name, does not require many lines of code.</p>
<p>@bryc provides an example and <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#lcg-lehmer-rng">a warning</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commonly called a Linear congruential generator (LCG), but in this case, more correctly called a Multiplicative congruential generator (MCG) or Lehmer RNG. It has a state and period of 2^31-1. It’s blazingly fast in JavaScript (likely the fastest), but its quality is quite poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>LCG</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    a <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>imul</span><span>(</span><span>48271</span><span>,</span> a<span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>0</span> <span>%</span> <span>2147483647</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(This is the first time I’ve come across <code>Math.imul()</code> — which provides <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/imul#Description">C-like 32-bit multiplication</a> of the two parameters.)</p>
<p>What does @bryc’s comment, “its quality is quite poor” mean in this context? Well, given certain even seeds, this algorithm has a pattern when the final step (the division) is removed.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>






<span>const</span> <span>LCG</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>s <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>imul</span><span>(</span><span>48271</span><span>,</span> s<span>)</span> <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">many</a> ways to test the quality of randomness. Some of the methodology and results of these tests can be understood by a layperson. One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Diehard battery of tests</a> plays 200000 games of craps and looks at the distribution of wins and the number of throws each game.</p>
<p>There’s also a test for LCGs called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_test">spectral test</a> which plots the sequence in two or more dimensions. In the example below, we can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplanes</a> that the spectral test measures for.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/940b3280e30ebce96af63d654d461af46f2afc28/26139/9e8cfab758735e8c6d06f733460f6a3f/lcg-3d.gif" alt="Hyperplanes of an LCG in three dimensions"></p>
</center>
<p>A PRNG eventually repeats its sequence. In this context, the <em>period</em> is the length of steps until the cycle repeats. Simpler PRNGs such as <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#mulberry32">Mulberry32</a> have a period as low as ~4 billion whereas the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38838863">Mersenne Twister</a> has a period of <code>2^19,937 - 1</code>. In 2015, the V8 team <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/math-random">said</a> that their implementation of <code>Math.random()</code> uses an algorithm called <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshiftplus.pdf">xorshift128+</a> which has a period of <code>2^128 - 1</code>. Its introduction can been seen in <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/085fed0fb5c3b0136827b5d7c190b4bd1c23a23e/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L102">this diff</a>.</p>
<p>If a PRNG eventually repeats itself, you might wonder why we call it repeatedly. Why not use the first number and then reset the internal state with a new seed? The problem with this is that the seed needs to originate from somewhere. If we continue to ask the OS for more random data there is a chance that the call may block (as the OS waits for more randomness to be generated) and our program will stall.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-required"><a href="#entropy-required" aria-label="entropy required permalink"></a>Entropy Required</h2>
<p>So you’ve settled on a PRNG and replaced <code>window.Math.random</code>. You’ve shipped it to your users and, at first, everyone seems to be happy.</p>
<p>But wait! You forgot about the seed. And now your users are complaining about the sequence of random numbers they get. It’s the same every time their customers’ page loads. All of their software is predictable. As a result, the web games they built are easy to beat.</p>
<p>Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-random-number-generators-and-their-limitations-linux">reminds us</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropy is the measurement of uncertainty or disorder in a system. Good entropy comes from the surrounding environment which is unpredictable and chaotic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When required, the generation of securely random numbers in the browser is performed by <code>Crypto.getRandomValues()</code> from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#Crypto-method-getRandomValues">Web Cryptography API</a>. Which is seeded by “a platform-specific random number function, the Unix <code>/dev/urandom</code> device, or other source of random or pseudorandom data.”</p>
<p>The Linux <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/char/random.c">source</a> suggests where this pseudorandom data can come from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an outside observer to measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also hardware devices that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Quantum_random_properties">quantum mechanical physical randomness</a>.</p>
<p>You can find many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack#Prominent_examples">prominent examples</a> of random number generator attacks which occurred because the wrong type (or not enough) entropy was used. Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/">famously</a> uses lava lamps as an entropy source. Since we are not attempting to create a secure algorithm, predictable sources of entropy like time are fine.</p>
<p>We can use <code>Date.now()</code> our seed state. This means that we will get a different random sequence for every millisecond. We could also use <code>performance.now()</code> which returns the length of time since the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin">time origin</a>.</p>
<p>Other possible ways of getting entropy in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crypto.getRandomValues</code>, <code>crypto</code> key generation, or similar (feels like cheating)</li>
<li>Mouse/touch events, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Ambient_Light_Events">ambient light events</a>, mic/webcam noise (hard to use on page load)</li>
<li>Geolocation API, Bluetooth API, or similar (need permission, doesn’t work on page load)</li>
<li>WebGL/video performance shenanigans</li>
<li>Most APIs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">listed here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s our slower (because it’s not native code) and unstable (because I haven’t tested it) replacement for <code>Math.random()</code>. Also note that PRNGs have requirements for the seed state (e.g. prime numbers, 128-bit). Our algorithm doesn’t comply with the <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf">seed recommendations</a> for the Xoshiro family.</p>

<h2 id="so-mission-accomplished"><a href="#so-mission-accomplished" aria-label="so mission accomplished permalink"></a>So, Mission Accomplished?</h2>
<p>Sadly it’s impossible to create a fully ECMAScript compliant replacement for <code>Math.random()</code> since the specification requires “distinct realms [to] produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.” A <em>realm</em> roughly means a different global environment (e.g. a different window, or a different <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">WebWorker</a>). Our version cannot reach outside its realm thus cannot make this guarantee.</p>
<p>However, there have been proposals for a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms API</a>. It’s not inconceivable that such an API would provide access to something like an incrementing realm id. This would give our algorithm the loophole it needs — access to Realm-unique entropy!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Supervised learning is the machine learning branch that deals with function approximation: using several input-output pairs generated by an unknown target function, construct a different function that approximates the target function. For example, the target function may be my personal movie preferences, and we might be interested in obtaining a model that can predict (approximately) how much I will enjoy watching some new movie. With such a model we can create a movie recommendation app.</p>

<p>Some functions can be easier to approximate than others (given a definition of approximation difficulty, but I won’t go down that rabbit hole right now), and some tasks can be framed as more than one function. This raises the question - do different framings result in different model performance? To find out I tried playing with two framings of a toy problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#olivetti-faces-dataset">Olivetti faces dataset</a>, which contains grayscale, 64x64 images of the faces of 40 subjects (10 images per subject). Here are some of the faces:
<img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_sample.png" alt="Face data sample"></p>

<h2 id="the-task">The task</h2>
<p>The task is the classical face recognition task (which has been quite controversial lately due to questionable use in settings such as law enforcement). To make things more interesting, I decided to use only two images from each subject for training, and the rest as the test set. So the goal is to train a model which, given an image, outputs the subject that the model believes this face belongs to.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>I wanted to focus just on the aspects of training that pertain to the problem framing, and treat it as a general problem. For that purpose I excluded many specifics that would be very important for a real face recognition application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using existing face recognition models or <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html">existing techniques specific to face recognition</a></li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0">data augmentation</a> to generate more training samples</li>
  <li>Obtaining more face data (even without subject information) and perform unsupervised pre-training</li>
  <li>Assigning each prediction a confidence score, and fixing a confidence threshold below which no result is reported</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I wanted to see what difference just changing the target function would make. Since the functions are different the models may be somewhat different as well, but they are trained on the same (base) data.</p>

<h3 id="performance-metric">Performance metric</h3>
<p>To measure model performance, I used the accuracy metric - percentage of correct classifications. For each framing I ran about 100 train/test splits (with two images in the training set and eight in the test set).</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>
<p>As a baseline I used a (single) nearest neighbor classifier with the L2 norm. I.e. when classifying a new face, for each face in the training set we calculate the sum of the squared differences bewteen every two pixels (in similar positions), and take as the answer the face that was closest.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_knn.png" alt="Nearest neighbor face classification"></p>

<p>Intuitively it’s hard to tell how well this model would fare. On one hand there should obviously be many similarities between images of the same person (including factors 
we would have liked to exclude, such as lighting and clothing).
On the other hand, many of the similarities we perceive in faces will not be reflected in the pixel-level comparison.
In this case the performance (measured as accuracy - percent of correct classifications) of the model was about  <strong>70.5%</strong>, which is quite impressive in my opinion, considering that a random model would achieve about 2.5% accuracy on average.</p>

<p>Let’s see how a more sophisticated model fares.</p>

<h2 id="first-approach">First approach</h2>
<p>The first framing is the explicit one: given an image, we want to know whose face it is, so that’s what we’ll ask the model. The function maps images to subject identifiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/first_approach.png" alt="Mapping image to subject ID"></p>

<p>For the model I used a simple network with Keras:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>),</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
		<span>BatchNormalization</span><span>(),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>64</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
		<span>BatchNormalization</span><span>(),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>y_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>
	<span>])</span>

<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>loss</span><span>=</span><span>'categorical_crossentropy'</span><span>,</span> <span>optimizer</span><span>=</span><span>'adam'</span><span>)</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>,</span> <span>epochs</span><span>=</span><span>1200</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I played with several variations and this seemed to be the best with regards to number of layers, their sizes and activation functions. Its test accuracy was, on average, about <strong>70.9%</strong> - an ever so slight improvement.
I think part of the challenge is that classifying faces requires relatively complex features, but we have very little training data (especially considering the number of positive instances for each class).
So the model either fails to find a pattern if the network is too small, or overfits if it’s too large.</p>

<h2 id="second-approach">Second approach</h2>
<p>Let’s try a less direct framing. We know that if two images belong to the same person, they should be relatively similar, and vice versa. Therefore, instead of training the model to identify faces, we can train the model to <em>compare</em> faces. In this case, instead of 40 classes (one for every subject) we only have two classes: “same person” or “not the same person”.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/second_approach.png" alt="Mapping image pairs to similarity"></p>

<p>Training this model was a little trickier:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The best architecture turned out to be pretty similar to two (“sideways”) concatenations of the first approach model, which I thought was pretty neat.</li>
  <li>Due to a vanishing gradients issue, I had to go with a slower learning rate and slow it even more as the loss decreased.</li>
  <li>This time we have an <em>imbalanced</em> classification task, so I gave the positive class a bigger weight.</li>
  <li>Training took longer and in a handful of cases (about 5 out of 100) didn’t converge and needed restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another difference is that using this framing, inference isn’t straightforward. Instead, we run the model on the input image along with each of the training images, and pick the subject of the image that the model deemed most similar to the input image.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the model and training:</p>

<p>The accuracy of this model was, on average, about <strong>74.4%</strong>, which is an improvement over both the first approach and the baseline. However, the spread of the results was larger, resulting in both much worse and much better runs. In this problem, a different framing made quite a significant difference.</p>

<h2 id="combined-approach">Combined approach</h2>
<p>After seeing the better average but also bigger spread of the second approach I wondered if it would be possible to create a model that optimizes for both using a non-linear computation graph.
The idea was this: each input sample would contain two faces, which would each “go through” several dense layers. The images would be transformed by the same layers separately, and the resulting representation would be used in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Classify each face</li>
  <li>Concatenate the two representations and, after several more dense layers, classify whether or not they belong to the same person</li>
</ol>

<p>I also used different weights for the two framings, which worked a little better.</p>

<p>Here’s a visual description of what’s happening:</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/combined_approach.png" alt="Combined approach model"></p>

<p>This model took the longest to train. The average accuracy was <strong>73.3%</strong>, better than the baseline and the first approach but not as good as the second; however, it was much more stable and there were no incidents of non-convergence. So it seems like the combination indeed enabled us to enjoy both worlds: a little better performance while preserving stability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Machine-aided programming tools such as type predictors and code summarizers are increasingly learning-based. However, most code representation learning approaches rely on supervised learning with task-specific annotated datasets.
                    We propose <em>Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode)</em>, a self-supervised algorithm for learning task-agnostic semantic representations of programs via contrastive learning. Our approach uses no human-provided labels, relying only on the raw text of programs.
                    In particular, we design an unsupervised pretext task by generating textually divergent copies of source functions via automated source-to-source compiler transforms that preserve semantics.
                    We train a neural model to identify variants of an anchor program within a large batch of negatives. To solve this task, the network must extract program features representing the functionality, not form, of the program.
                    This is the first application of instance discrimination to code representation learning to our knowledge. We pre-train models over 1.8m unannotated JavaScript methods mined from GitHub. ContraCode pre-training improves code summarization accuracy by 7.9% over supervised approaches and 4.8% over RoBERTa pre-training.
                    Moreover, our approach is agnostic to model architecture; for a type inference task, contrastive pre-training consistently improves the accuracy of existing baselines.

                <h2>Compiler transforms for code data augmentation</h2>
                <p>Finding equivalent programs in a dataset is challenging. In computer vision, random crops of a source image are frequently used as "equivalent" views of it for augmenting training sets or for unsupervised pre-training. However, it's challenging to define similar data augmentations for natural and programming languages. We propose to use <em>automated source-to-source compiler transformations</em> to generate augmentations of programs that preserve functionality. These transforms include dead code elimination, variable renaming and constant folding. We also explore lossy transforms like code deletion that only preserve some of the program semantics.

                <h2>Contrastive pre-training</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode) is a pretext representation learning task that uses these code augmentations to construct a challenging <em>discriminative</em> pretext task that requires the model to identify equivalent programs out of a large dataset of distractors. 
                    In doing so, it has to embed the functionality, not form, of the code. 
                    In essence, the domain knowledge from our code transformations induces the knowledge of the structure of programs onto learned representations.

                <h2>Finetuning on downstream tasks</h2>
                <p>
                    By learning functionality-based representations, a model pre-trained with ContraCode outperforms baselines that are are trained from scratch or pre-trained with reconstruction objectives like masked language modeling. We demonstrate these improvements by finetuning LSTM and Transformer models on type inference and code summarization tasks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we would like to compress one or several files into one zipped file or decompress a zipped file. It is very common to use tools such as gzip, zip, or 7zip to create or decompress <code>.gz</code>, <code>.zip</code>, and <code>.7z</code> files, respectively. However, none of these tools on Linux uses multicore and multithread during compression and decompression. When the number of files are large or the file sizes are large, compression and decompression would take a lot of time using single thread.</p>



<p>Pigz is one of the parallel implementation for gzip and zip. Using pigz could greatly save us the time spent on compression and decompression. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to use pigz.</p>

<h3 id="pigz">Pigz</h3>

<p>The pigz usages in the blog post are mainly targeted for Ubuntu systems. However, its usages on other Linux operating systems should be almost the same.</p>

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>pigz
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="pigz-usages">Pigz Usages</h4>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pigz --help
Usage: pigz [options] [files ...]
  will compress files in place, adding the suffix '.gz'. If no files are
  specified, stdin will be compressed to stdout. pigz does what gzip does,
  but spreads the work over multiple processors and cores when compressing.

Options:
  -0 to -9, -11        Compression level (level 11, zopfli, is much slower)
  --fast, --best       Compression levels 1 and 9 respectively
  -b, --blocksize mmm  Set compression block size to mmmK (default 128K)
  -c, --stdout         Write all processed output to stdout (won't delete)
  -d, --decompress     Decompress the compressed input
  -f, --force          Force overwrite, compress .gz, links, and to terminal
  -F  --first          Do iterations first, before block split for -11
  -h, --help           Display a help screen and quit
  -i, --independent    Compress blocks independently for damage recovery
  -I, --iterations n   Number of iterations for -11 optimization
  -J, --maxsplits n    Maximum number of split blocks for -11
  -k, --keep           Do not delete original file after processing
  -K, --zip            Compress to PKWare zip (.zip) single entry format
  -l, --list           List the contents of the compressed input
  -L, --license        Display the pigz license and quit
  -m, --no-time        Do not store or restore mod time
  -M, --time           Store or restore mod time
  -n, --no-name        Do not store or restore file name or mod time
  -N, --name           Store or restore file name and mod time
  -O  --oneblock       Do not split into smaller blocks for -11
  -p, --processes n    Allow up to n compression threads (default is the
                       number of online processors, or 8 if unknown)
  -q, --quiet          Print no messages, even on error
  -r, --recursive      Process the contents of all subdirectories
  -R, --rsyncable      Input-determined block locations for rsync
  -S, --suffix .sss    Use suffix .sss instead of .gz (for compression)
  -t, --test           Test the integrity of the compressed input
  -v, --verbose        Provide more verbose output
  -V  --version        Show the version of pigz
  -Y  --synchronous    Force output file write to permanent storage
  -z, --zlib           Compress to zlib (.zz) instead of gzip format
  --                   All arguments after "--" are treated as files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A typical command for compressing and decompressing a file is like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span># Always use -k to keep the original file</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> image.png
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-dk</span> <span>-p8</span> image.gz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, vanilla pigz is not very friendly to compressing multiple files into one single file and custom output filepath. We would need to rely on tar, the archive tool.</p>

<h4 id="tar-pigz-usages">Tar-Pigz Usages</h4>

<p>Using pipe <code>|</code>, we could first archive multiple files or directories first to <code>.tar</code> file and compress using pigz to further generate <code>.tar.gz</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-cf</span> - data/ index.json | pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> <span>&gt;</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Decompress (Unfortunately two steps)</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, tar has already integrated custom compressor in its interface, which makes the command looks more clear.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -k -p8"</span> <span>-cf</span> dataset.tar.gz data/ index.json
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -dk -p8"</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar.gz <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

    Wt has a lot to offer. It includes the essential basic widgets and building blocks to
    build web applications, but also offers built-in security, PDF rendering, a 2D and 3D painting system, 
    an object-relational mapping library, a charting library, and an authentication framework.

          <h4>Server side, client optimized</h4>
          <p>Wt employs a signal-slot system. Instead of worrying about the sending of Ajax requests and serving of pages, you can simply connect the click of a button to a callback function on the server.
    
      <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/widgets/forms#form-simple">Take a look at this example in the widget gallery.</a>
    
    
    Wt will use whatever technology available for communication: Ajax or WebSockets, but will fall back on full HTML
    page loads when JavaScript is unavailable. This makes Wt applications accessible to any browser or web crawler.

          <h4>Built-in security</h4>
          <p>
    Wt automatically protects against misuse by only allowing visible and enabled widgets to be interacted with.
    This also helps to avoid CSRF attacks, which are doubly avoided because Wt does not store session information in cookies.
    By using the widget abstraction, Wt discourages the inserting of raw HTML into a web page, preventing XSS attacks.
    
      Wt::Dbo prevents SQL injection by encouraging the use of prepared statements when accessing the database.
    
    Wt also includes an authentication and registration system with support for OAuth
    providers like Google, Facebook, and OpenID Connect.

          <h4>2D and 3D painting system</h4>
          <p>
    Use a single 2D drawing API with many backends (PNG, JPEG, SVG, HTML canvas, VML, and PDF) so you only need to write
    your drawing code once to support any web browser and save to many formats. Write server-side (OpenGL) and
    client-side (WebGL) 3D graphics with a uniform API. Wt's 2D and 3D charting libraries were built on top of this
    graphics API.

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.

			<a name="TheGame">
			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Lets be frank, the Internet is simply unusable with all the ads floating around.</p><p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a> extension in my browser, as do most of the people reading this genre of articles, but the same is not true for the majority of the population, including other members of my family. So in order to enhance their web browsing experience I decided to block ads at the DNS level.</p><p>But why stop there I thought, why not also improve their privacy while I'm at it. So I also decided to setup a VPN. Now let me clarify some things here, I'm not a big fan of VPNs, the way they're advertised by the big companies, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great video by Tom Scott</a> explaining what I mean. But they also have their use cases, some of which are:</p><ul><li>Prohibiting ISPs from collecting data on my browsing patterns</li><li>Circumvent internet censorship</li><li>Connect to my home network from anywhere</li></ul><p>I took a look at apps like <a href="https://blokada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blokada</a> and <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS66</a> which grant you device wide ad blocking on mobile devices. On Android <a href="https://block.blokada.org/post/2018/06/17/how-does-blokada-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way this works is</a>, by creating an internal VPN on the phone, so that all traffic from the device can be routed via it, and it has a file with all the blacklisted domains, to filter out traffic.</p><p>But there's a caveat with this approach. I cannot use another VPN to route my traffic, due to an Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limitation</a>.</p><blockquote><p>There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.</p></blockquote><p>This means my browsing patterns are still accessible to my ISP. So, I started looking for ad blocking DNS servers, so that I could point Android's global DNS to it. I found <a href="https://adguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdGuard</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a> to be the top projects. Hosting these at home, on Raspberry Pi seemed like a plausible solution, but then again one can't use it while traveling. The solution is to obviously host it on a publicly accessible server. Amongst the two I found AdGuard more appealing due to the following reasons</p><ul><li>It has out of the box support for DNS-over-TLS</li><li>It maintains a single file for its entire configuration</li><li>It's written in Golang, and is much lighter on resources compared to PiHole</li></ul><p>You can find more about their differences <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#how-does-adguard-home-compare-to-pi-hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Both are great projects, but AdGuard met my requirements perfectly.</p><p>When it comes to VPN, I did not even consider using OpenVPN, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WireGuard</a> was the obvious choice, because of it's speed, smaller, easily auditable codebase (not that I was going to audit it, but still), cross platform compatibility and integration into the Linux Kernel.</p><p>Being a big fan of Kubernetes and maintaining infrastructure as code, I wanted a way to be able to easily deploy and version control my deployment. After much searching I stumbled upon, <a href="https://github.com/squat/kilo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kilo</a>, a network overlay built on WireGuard for Kubernetes. It could do exactly what I wanted, while also enhancing the security of my cluster, by encrypting the inter pod communication, and allowing me to build secure clusters, over nodes spanning multiple cloud providers. Also it would give me the added benefit of easily debugging applications deployed on my Kubernetes Cluster, since when connected I would be a peer on the network, thereby getting access to the all the private IPs of the deployments, services etc. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPz_DAOOCKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this talk by Lucas Servén Marín</a> to know more.</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump right into the setup. I'll be explaining the steps for setting it up on a <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">k3s</a> cluster. You may need to modify them as per your cluster. After deploying k3s, the 1st thing which needs to be done is to setup kilo. First download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifest</a> for kilo on k3s.</p><pre><code>curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>Now you need to modify and add <code>- --mesh-granularity=full</code> to the <code>DaemonSet</code> section under the <code>args</code> for the <code>kilo</code> container.</p><pre><code>...
containers:
- name: kilo
  image: squat/kilo
  args:
  - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
  - --hostname=$(NODE_NAME)
  - --mesh-granularity=full
  env:
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: spec.nodeName
...
</code></pre><p>This is done to ensure all our nodes are meshed together regardless of the datacenter. Then simply apply the manifest.</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>This will later be useful for setting up WireGuard VPN. More on this later. Now we can proceed to setup AdGuard. Here is the spec for AdGuard.</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1

</code></pre><p>The <code>RollingUpdate</code> is intentionally configured to not wait till a new pod is up, and directly terminate the existing pod during deploys. On the surface it seems like an anti-pattern, but since I'm using the <code>hostPort</code> directive, a new Pod wouldn't get scheduled unless port <code>53</code> was available on the host for it to bind to, so the existing Pod has to terminate before a new Pod can be deployed.</p><p>Also I initially intended to use a <code>ConfigMap</code> for holding the <code>AdGuardHome.yml</code>, but there was some issue with AdGuard trying to write to it while initally comming up, but since <code>ConfigMap</code>'s are moundted as <code>ReadOnly</code>, Pod creation used to fail, so I decided to go with a Volume instead, until I could figure out the issue.</p><p>For the initial setup, the AdGuard admin UI will be accessible on port 3000, so you'll have to switch the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>3000</code> in the <code>adguardhome</code> service initially, access the admin UI, setup the password, and then revert the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>80</code>.</p><p>You may also enable <code>DNSSEC</code> under <code>DNS Settings</code> for guaranteeing authenticity of DNS responses by signing them, and making tampering detectable.</p><p>The volume mounts for <code>tls-cert-secret</code> are only necessary if you want to enable DNS-over-TLS. And you need to configure your ingress resource before mounting it here.</p><p>For enabling DNS-over-TLS, on the AdGuard admin UI you can goto <code>Encryption Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Enable Encryption</code>, and put in the Certificate path as <code>/certs/tls.crt</code> and the Key path as <code>/certs/tls.key</code>. Again let me re-iterate that your Ingress resource needs to be configured properly and you need to have a valid TLS certificate for the domain you're hosting AdGuard on.</p><p>On Android phones for Android Pie and later, you may goto <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>WiFi and Internet</code> -&gt; <code>Private DNS</code>. Select <code>Private DNS Hostname Provider</code> and set it to the domain name to the once you've configured on. You may also configure it on your home router to ensure all the devices get DNS level Ad Blocking.</p><p>This concludes the AdGuard part of the setup.</p><hr><p>Now coming to setting up WireGuard.</p><p>I'll be referring to the k3s cluster as the server and the local laptop as the client from here on.</p><p>You'll need WireGaurd installed on both your server and client machine. Follow the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps as per your distribution</a> to install the same. If you're using a bleeding edge distro like Archlinux or Gentoo, you don't need to do anything on the server side, since WireGuard is already baked into the kernel at this point. On the client side however you'll need to install it for getting the command line client to enable / disable the interface.</p><p>Another useful tool to have on the client side is <code>kgctl</code>. You can install it using</p><pre><code>go get github.com/squat/kilo/cmd/kgctl
</code></pre><p>Now we need to create a private and a public key pair on the client.</p><pre><code>wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</code></pre><p>This'll create 2 files with the respective key contents. This key pair needs to be authorized on the server. You can do this simply by creating a peer resource. Create a file named <code>archie.yaml</code></p><pre><code>apiVersion: kilo.squat.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Peer
metadata:
  name: archie
spec:
  allowedIPs:
  - 10.120.120.1/32 # This is just and example, you can use any valid available CIDR here
  publicKey: CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY # Enter the public key here, the one you just generated
  persistentKeepalive: 10
</code></pre><p>Finally apply the manifest</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f archie.yaml
</code></pre><p>Remember, the <code>allowedIPs</code> should be a valid CIDR, which is available on both the server and the client. Now we can use the <code>kgctl</code> tool to generate the <code>peer</code> section of the client WireGuard config.</p><pre><code>kgctl showconf peer archie
</code></pre><p>This will return something like</p><pre><code>[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 10.42.0.0/24, 10.42.0.0/32, 10.4.0.1/32
Endpoint = YOUR_SERVER_IP:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 10
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
</code></pre><p>Create a file on the client named <code>adgaurd.yaml</code> at the location <code>/etc/wireguard</code> and add the following contents to it</p><pre><code>[Interface]
Address = 10.120.120.1/32 # Use the same CIDR whitelisted in the Peer manifest
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY # The one you generated above on your client
DNS = YOUR_SERVER_IP # Enter the IP of the server to block ads, FQDN don't work on Android for some reason

[Peer]</code></pre></div></div></div>

<h2>Introducing crsh: a Javascript based command line shell</h2>
<p>12 July 2020</p>
<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://github.com/curlywurlycraig/crsh">GitHub link -&gt; Install instructions</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Existing shells generally operate with their own somewhat archaic syntax,
continuous with the underlying operating system and set of historical design choices.</p>

<p>This puts the majority of shell syntax just out of reach for a very large subset of command line users who use the command line for little more than launching one or two command line tools, navigating directories, and maybe ocassionally piping commands or outputting them to files. These users will usually write scripts in a language more familiar to them as soon as things get a little trickier (because the value of learning the control flow syntax in <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, or <code>fish</code> does not seem like time well spent).</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of those shells, exactly. But it does highlight a potential space for new shells that can better fulfill the needs of these users. Conversely, if you are an experienced bash shell scripter, and terms like “file descriptors” and <code>SIGCHLD</code> mean something to you, you will probably dislike my approach here. But please feel free to stick around and provide some advice.</p>

<h2 id="enter-crsh">Enter crsh</h2>

<p>I’ve started work on a shell that can seamlessly interoperate Javascript syntax (and in fact works by <code>eval</code>ing JS in the Deno runtime) and traditional shell execution.</p>

<p>Regular command execution will be familiar to those who have used the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls | grep .js
builtins.js
dsh.js
functions.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And inline anonymous functions will be familiar to those who have used Javascript:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span>
<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Returning a list from an inline function will be outputted as separate lines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>fill</span><span>().</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`Line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>0</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>1</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>2</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Combining these concepts can yield a very expressive shell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>ls</span> <span>|</span> <span>({</span> <span>lines</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>lines</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> <span>line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>line</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>js</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note in the above that <code>lines</code> is made available to piped inline functions.
JSON output piped into an inline function is automatically parsed and made available as a <code>json</code> parameter:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/58611129-2dbc-4a81-a72f-77ddfc1b1b49 | ({ json }) =&gt; json.title
My Neighbor Totoro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As can be seen, such a shell lends itself very well to parsing JSON (it is <em>Javascript</em> Object Notation after all).</p>

<p>To go one step further in this example, we can navigate multi-request JSON API calls in a human-readable way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>curl</span> <span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/ | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].people | xargs curl | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the above may look less readable than something like <code>jq</code>, those with a Javascript background will appreciate the transferability of knowledge. Even without such a background, the advantage of executing arbitrary logic inline with other shell calls in a modern language should be apparent.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Currently, the easy parts to configure are the prompt and auto-completion rules. This is done by way of editing the JS source directly. The prompt is specified as a function which returns a string, and exported from a <code>prompt.js</code> file like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>magenta</span><span>,</span> <span>stripColor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/std/fmt/colors.ts"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>prompt</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>currentDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>magenta</span><span>(</span><span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>());</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>currentDir</span><span>}</span><span> › `</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>promptLength</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>stripColor</span><span>(</span><span>prompt</span><span>()).</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the auto-completion rules are specified as a list of objects representing the regex to match the input on, and the logic to return the list of completion to cycle through:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>gitRules</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git add /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeFile</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git checkout /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git branch -D /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeCommands</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Community-made auto-completion rules and prompts could be hosted in the usual <a href="https://deno.land/x">Deno way</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>There is still a lot to do to make this better. Bug fixes, features like multiline support, persisting history, etc. Any feedback is welcome in the form of issues in the GitHub repo.</p>

<![CDATA[The Future of Online Identity Is Decentralized]]>

July 12, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Online identity</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity">Online&nbsp;identity</a> refers to the concept of "being" in the digital world. As an internet user, you exist. You create accounts on websites. You write on social media and blogs. You post photos. All this online activity has in common that one and the same person performed these actions; it defines your "online&nbsp;identity".</p>
<p>However, your "online&nbsp;identity" is not <em>per se</em> representative of your "social&nbsp;identity" in the physical world.</p>
<p>You may choose to use your own name or a pseudonym. You may choose to publish personally identifiable information or not. You may choose to remain truthful to your social identity or deceive. In short, you may choose for authenticity or for anonymity.</p>
<h2>Authenticity versus anonymity</h2>
<p>Authenticity and anonymity aren't mutually exclusive and that is the beauty of the internet. In the physical realm, you are (mostly) limited to a single social identity. In the digital space, there are no such restrictions. While you can't embody multiple persons in the offline world, you can have several identities online. In fact, you can even have multiple accounts on the same platform, opting for a different balance between authenticity and anonymity for each one of them.</p>
<p>The anonymity has its downsides, creating psychological artifacts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect">online&nbsp;disinhibition</a> and facilitating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying">cyberharassment</a>. However, even though we are far from completely overcoming these challenges, the internet that allows us to remain anonymous is still the one we should want and fight for.</p>
<h2>Consolidation of identity and internet corporations</h2>
<p>Removing the possibility for anonymity could solve the problem of online toxicity. Large internet corporations like Google and Facebook allow all to create an account on condition that some personally identifiable information is revealed, usually a phone number.</p>
<p>The benefit is that it deters most from repeatably creating new accounts when older accounts have been flagged or banned due to improper behavior. These companies gain the function of "identity provider": they manage your online identity that can be used to login in different locations of the internet. We all know many websites that offer a "Google login" or "Facebook login".</p>
<p>But there is a problem: handling the entire online identity of a single person is too much responsibility for any corporation or organization, especially if it is in their interest to gain intimate individual knowledge and sell it (Google) or use it to manipulate moods and influence decision making (Facebook).</p>
<p>That phone number that was once used to prevent online toxicity is now the first of many pieces of personally identifiable information that these corporations will seek and use to figure out who you are.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to hide"? Great. The internet corporations will still make money hand over fist by selling your personality, your preferences, your buying patterns and your vote. And not just yours. That of entire populations.</p>
<p>Know that profits are just the tip of the iceberg. Governments all around the world are also interested in knowing what their citizens think, say and do for very different motives.</p>
<h2>Going decentralized</h2>
<p>The solution is relatively simple. When you create a new account and get to choose between "Google&nbsp;login", "Facebook&nbsp;login" and "Email&nbsp;login", pick "Email&nbsp;login".</p>
<p>The benefit of not giving away any more personal data and tracking possibilities outweigh the inconvenience of having to fill in your email address and a password, especially when using a password manager. As tempting as the alternative is, making these changes will improve your life and ultimately, when enough people join these efforts, that of the world population.</p>
<p>A different problem arises: how to prove online identity when decentralized?</p>
<h2>Decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>When you are no longer relying on an identity provider to manage your entire online identity, you lose the one common thing all your accounts on different platforms had: if two accounts on different online platforms are created by the same Google or Facebook account, we can safely assume they belong to the same person.</p>
<p>But this "trust by proxy" is lost when the accounts on those platforms were created without identity provider. And whether authentic or anonymous, it can sometimes be extremely useful to know and trust that separate accounts on the internet belong to the same person, even when not knowing who this person is.</p>
<p>The username is not sufficient to identify accounts across platforms. If you are "Alice" on one website, chances are you might need to be "Alice123" on the next one. And what if someone close to you is contacted by an "Aliss" requesting an amount of money to be transferred because they believe you to be in some sort of trouble? A poor attempt at impersonation, I know… Don't worry, a real bad actor will put in more effort and make a much more convincing act.</p>
<h2>Proving decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>What if not only your online identity is decentralized, but also the tool to prove said online identity? This would mean that you wouldn't need to depend on a single company or entity to prove your identity across platforms. Decentralized identity, decentralized proofs!</p>
<p>Such solutions are already being deployed in industry, for example by firms like <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech</a> which focus on blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Built for individuals, I recently launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide</a> which uses cryptographic keypairs to accomplish decentralized identity verification. While it doesn't (and shouldn't!) link an account to a person in the physical realm, it links accounts across platforms.</p>
<p>If you trust an account on one platform, you can trust any other account on any other platform as long as they are both verified by "identity proofs" stored in the same keypair. Whether you choose authenticity or anonymity, decentralized identity proofs allow you to build a cross-platform online identity.</p>
<p>Here's my <a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">Keyoxide profile</a>. In this case, I link to several "authentic" accounts but I could easily generate a new keypair void of personal data that links to several anonymous accounts. The accounts don't need to be authentic to create an online persona.</p>
<p>All the accounts listed in the link above belong to me. No one else could claim these accounts. Here's how.</p>
<h2>Identity proofs</h2>
<p>An "identity proof" is nothing more than a link to an account A on some platform P stored inside your keypair K. If a "proof verification tool" such as Keyoxide follows this link and discovers some piece of data linking back to keypair K (which is only possible if keypair K and account A on platform P belong to the same person), the account is verified. If this proof verification is done for several accounts on different platforms, it is beyond reasonable doubt that the same person owns said accounts.</p>
<p>No bad actor could claim one of your accounts: the piece of data that links back is specific to your keypair, not the bad actor's keypair. And the bad actor also couldn't insert a proof inside your keypair as long as your keypair isn't compromised. Only you, the owner of the keypair, can add new proofs. But the entire world can read and verify them.</p>
<p>These identity proofs are decentralized because Keyoxide doesn't store them, your cryptographic keypair does. Keyoxide simply reads the keys and verifies the proofs. When you remove a proof from your keypair, Keyoxide will no longer have access to it. You own your proofs and your online identity.</p>
<p>In fact, the proofs are readable by everyone and are not specifically designed for Keyoxide. Anyone can use any tool or create new ones to verify these proofs and developers are encouraged to enrich this field with additional tools and services. Let's build a decentralized identity ecosystem we can all trust.</p>
<h2>Online identity beyond today's internet</h2>
<p>Initiatives like <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid">Solid</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> are paving the way for a new internet where all data is owned by the user and shared with platforms with consent and restrictions. This would solve the online identity problem: you get the benefits of a "pseudo centralized" account while maintaining full ownership over all account-related data stored on a decentralized platform. Social media would be allowed to see some data, messaging platforms some other data. But there would still be one single account to rule all the platforms.</p>
<p>On today's internet, the best we can do is make fully separated accounts, link them using technologies like decentralized online identity proofs and create our own online personas, with our own open tools that ensure we maintain ownership over them.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="Pattern-Matching"><a href="#Pattern-Matching" title="Pattern Matching"></a>Pattern Matching</h2><p>To understand Pattern Matching, let’s start with something familiar in JavaScript - Switch Case.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example that uses <code>switch case</code> in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>print_color</span><span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"rose"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"roses are red,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"violet"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"violets are blue,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"sugar is sweet, and so are you."</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"rose"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"violet"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"you"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust code:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>print_color</span><span>(</span>color<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>str<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> color <span>{</span>

<p>Most of the code should be immediately understandable. The <code>match</code> expression has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code><span>match</span> VALUE <span>{</span>
  PATTERN1 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION1<span>,</span>
  PATTERN2 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION2<span>,</span>
  PATTERN3 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION3<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code> syntax might trip us up because of the similarities with JavaScript arrow functions but they’re unrelated. The last pattern that uses underscore <code>_</code> is called the catchall pattern and is similar to the default case in switch case. Each <code>PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION</code> combination is called a <code>match arm</code>.</p>
<p>The above example doesn’t really convey how useful pattern matching is - it just looks like switch case with a different syntax and a fancy name. Let’s talk about destructuring and enums to understand why pattern matching is useful.</p>
<h2 id="Destructuring"><a href="#Destructuring" title="Destructuring"></a>Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring is the process of extracting the inner fields of an array or struct into separate variables. If you have used destructuring in JavaScript, it is very similar in Rust.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>blue<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"shesh"</span><span>,</span> city<span>:</span> <span>"singapore"</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>city<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same example in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Person <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
  city<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> blue<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

  <span>let</span> person <span>=</span> Person <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>"shesh"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    city<span>:</span> <span>"singapore"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> Person <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> city<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Comparing-Structs"><a href="#Comparing-Structs" title="Comparing Structs"></a>Comparing Structs</h2><p>It’s very common to write “if this then that” type of code. Combining destructuring and pattern matching allows us to write these type of logic in a very concise way.</p>
<p>Let’s take this following example in JavaScript. It’s contrived but you have probably written something like this sometime in your career:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> point <span>=</span> <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span> point<span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is zero and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is zero`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s write the same code in Rust using pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Point <span>{</span>
  x<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
  y<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> point <span>=</span> Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>match</span> point <span>{</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a bit concise compared to the <code>if else</code> logic but also might be confusing as we’re performing comparison, destructuring and variable binding at the same time.</p>
<p>This is how it looks like visually:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-1.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We begin to see why it’s named as “pattern matching” - we take an input and see which pattern in the match arms “fits” better - It’s like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shape+sorter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape sorter</a> toys that kids play with. Apart from comparison, we also do variable binding in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th match arms. We pass variables x or y or both to their respective expressions.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is also <code>exhaustive</code> - that is, it forces you to handle all the possible cases. Try removing the last match arm and Rust won’t let you compile the code.</p>
<h2 id="Enum"><a href="#Enum" title="Enum"></a>Enum</h2><p>JavaScript doesn’t have Enums but if you’ve used TypeScript, you can think of Rust’s Enums as a combination of TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enums</a> and TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discriminated Unions</a></p>
<p>In the simplest case, Enums can be used as a group of constants.</p>
<p>For example, even though JavaScript doesn’t have Enums, you might have used this pattern:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> DIRECTION <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  FORWARD<span>:</span> <span>"FORWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  BACKWARD<span>:</span> <span>"BACKWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  LEFT<span>:</span> <span>"LEFT"</span><span>,</span>
  RIGHT<span>:</span> <span>"RIGHT"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>BACKWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>LEFT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>RIGHT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here, we could’ve defined the FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT as separate constants, yet grouping it inside the DIRECTION object has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT are namespaced under DIRECTION so naming conflicts can be avoided</li>
<li>It is self-documenting as we can quickly see all the valid directions available in the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if someone passes NORTH or UP as an argument to move_drone? To fix this, we can add a validation to make sure that only values present in the DIRECTION object is allowed in the move function.</li>
<li>What if we decide to support UP and DOWN in future or rename LEFT/RIGHT to PORT/STARBOARD? We need to find all the places where similar switch-case or if-else is used. There’s a chance that we might miss out a few places which would cause issues in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enums in strongly typed languages like Rust are more powerful as they solve these problems without us writing extra code.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a function can take in only a small set of valid inputs, Enums can be used to enforce this constraint</li>
<li>Enums with pattern matching force you to cover all cases. Useful when you’re updating Enums in future</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust example:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Direction <span>{</span>
  Forward<span>,</span>
  Backward<span>,</span>
  Left<span>,</span>
  Right<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>:</span> Direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> direction <span>{</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Backward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Left <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Right <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We access the <code>variants</code> inside Enum using the <code>::</code> notation. Try editing this code by calling “move_drone(Direction::Up)” or adding “Down” as a new item in the Direction enum. In the first case, the compiler will throw an error saying that “Up” is not found in “Direction” and in the second case, the compiler will complain that we haven’t covered “Down” in the match block.</p>
<p>Rust Enums can do much more than act as a group of constants - we can also associate data with an Enum variant.</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Direction <span>{</span>
  Forward<span>,</span>
  Backward<span>,</span>

<p>Here, we’ve added one more Enum called Operation that contains “unit like” variants (PowerOn, PowerOff, Rotate) and “struct like” variants (Move, TakePhoto). Notice how we’ve used pattern matching with destructuring and variable binding.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><span>This is a story of how the SAS rescued myself and two colleagues who were trapped in the British embassy in Tirana having been evacuated into the embassy on 12th September 12th 1998 as the country erupted into civil unrest and lawlessness. The boys from Hereford did good!</span></p>
<p>This was my first diplomatic posting and during the course of my career I took part in the <span>evacuation of British nationals&nbsp;(and others)</span><span>&nbsp;in a number of locations but on this occasion, I was the one being evacuated albeit from my residence to the embassy as a place of safety.<a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/libya-timely-evacuation-of-oil-workers/">Libya – Timely Evacuation Of Oil Workers During Arab Spring 2011</a></span></p>
<p>This was a day I was not going to forget in a hurry. I had just under four months left before my tour ended and I had spent the previous day at work trawling through future job opportunities. The Ambassador was again out of the country and the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) was once more in charge. I should have known from previous experience and recent incidents that trouble always seemed to flare up when Ambassadors are away from post.</p>
<p>On this day, I awoke very early to the sounds of large explosions and the rattle of gunfire that seemed to be going off in all directions. What was going on? There had been no forewarning of trouble and things had been relatively quiet and stable in the city over the preceding weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to get hold of the DHM on my mobile phone but the network was down, always a bad sign. I immediately got on the embassy radio net and contacted her. She said that she had just heard from the German Embassy that a local high profile opposition politician, Azem Hajdari, had been assassinated outside the Parliament building and his Democratic Party (DP) supporters were on the warpath blaming the Socialist government party for the murder.</p>
<p>Tanks, automatic weapons and armoured personnel carriers had been seized by DP members and the government were now calling this an attempted coup d’etat and responding with armed force of its own.</p>
<p>She advised me to keep my head down, keep the radio close to hand and they would try and get an Embassy armoured vehicle to me as soon as possible and we would all rendezvous at the embassy. By this time, the noise of fighting outside seemed to be getting louder and getting nearer. The main government quarter was only just two blocks away from my apartment and it sounded like the main fighting was in this area. I cautiously pulled back a shutter and looked outside and saw there was a lot of smoke billowing forth from that quarter.</p>
<p>After about an hour, I heard a familiar voice on the radio, it was Benny our Embassy driver calling from the armoured car radio just outside my front gate. Not for the first time had he come to get me out of another messy situation. He advised me to be careful coming out as there was a body in front of my gate.</p>
<p>As I came out, the noise was deafening, there was small arms firing which appeared to be coming from the next street and there was indeed a man in what looked like a policeman’s uniform lying just to the side of my gate.</p>
<p>I didn’t hang around to assess his condition as just at that moment, a large group of armed men turned the corner on to my street firing in our direction as they advanced. Why they were shooting at a vehicle that was clearly marked as a diplomatic car, I had no idea. I jumped into the car and Benny quickly reversed the vehicle away from the onrushing crowd, turned it around at the intersection and off we sped to the embassy taking as many back roads as possible.</p>
<p>We reached the embassy safely but it was disturbing to see that the usual government provided armed security guarding the Embassy and the surrounds was nowhere to be seen. We drew up to the embassy and I ran into the building. Both the DHM and Management Officer (MO) were already there. The DHM had already contacted London and appraised them of the situation. It appeared that the violence was escalating and that it could very well be a coup d’etat. London advised us to remain in lockdown in the embassy and to stay there until further notice. Not very reassuring.</p>
<p>The hours went by, nighttime came and the sky was lit up with explosions and the gunfire seemed to be getting closer to the embassy. Throughout all of this, the DHM was updating London via our secure communication channels of our ever-growing precarious situation. They continued to advise us to stay in the embassy as help was on the way. What did that mean? How on earth were they going to help us? They were in London and we were trapped and bottled up at the sharp end.</p>
<p>Well, indeed help was on the way in the most unexpected form. After a long, restless and uncomfortable night trying to sleep on the floor of my office under my desk, as dawn was breaking, there was the sound of screeching tyres outside the embassy.</p>
<p>At first we thought this was it, the bad guys had arrived and we were destined for some form of uncertain captivity or worse, but no, out of two strange looking 4x4s, poured a section of heavily armed and equipped Special Air Service (SAS) troopers who had flown into Tirana airport from the UK in an RAF transport aircraft (without any flight clearance), offloaded themselves and sped the 17 Kms to the embassy.</p>
<p>There were no formalities, the SAS section commander immediately told the DHM that he was in charge and that we were to follow his instructions until further notice. For the time being, he said, there were no orders for evacuating us, his men would go out and evaluate the situation on the ground and then make a recommendation back to London.</p>
<p>They then set up their own communications suite in the Ambassador’s office (their communication specialist felt very much at home behind the large Ambassadorial desk), brought in their weapons and stores and after a short briefing, their patrol set off. Benny our driver volunteered to go with them and act as guide and interpreter if needed.</p>
<p>While one party was employed on this task another group made a start of setting up defensive positions within the embassy and thoroughly briefing us on what to do if we were subjected to an attack. It really was a boost to our morale that we had these guys now with us, more than able to physically protect us and if needed get us out of there to a place of safety if things deteriorated.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon the first patrol returned to the embassy. The good news was that they reported our homes had appeared from the outside not to have been looted. They said there was still heavy fighting going on in various parts of the city, but it seemed to be centred mainly around the government quarter. Benny told us later that the patrol had been menaced on several occasions by armed men, but a few well aimed shots above the heads of the mob had convinced them to melt away and not to mess with the patrol.</p>
<p>The fighting went on for about three days. Each day the sound of gunfire and explosions seemed to decrease. The SAS continued to send out rotating patrols to monitor the situation in and around the city, deciding after the third day that there was no need to evacuate us out of the country as their assessment was the fighting had run its course. Indeed thankfully, on the fourth day there was silence, no gunfire and no explosions.</p>
<p>The SAS kept us in the embassy for just over a week before they deemed it fully safe for us to return to our homes and resume normal work. We also received reassurances from the Albanian government that the fighting had now ceased, order had been restored and our local security would be reinstated. All of this was good news indeed.</p>
<p>However, it was a sad day when we came to bid farewell to our SAS rescuers as they packed up to leave. We had got to know them pretty well over the course of a long week. They were a thoroughly professional, no nonsense group of guys who were extremely sociable in the rare moments they took time out to relax in between patrols with a wealth of stories that kept us entertained during the long days and nights we were cooped up in the embassy.</p>
<p>I personally would miss their army ration packs on which we all lived, apart from rare welcome pizzas they brought back occasionally from goodness knows where by some of the patrols.</p>
<p>With impeccable timing, the day after they left, the Ambassador returned to post. Even he, not usually one to crack a joke at the best of times remarked tongue in cheek that in future he would give us ample warning of his next trip out of country so that we could be prepared for the next crisis. Not funny. Yes, by all means forewarn us of your next absence but make it far enough in advance so that I for one could also ensure I was not around as well!</p>

<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903">recent paper</a> suggested a new mathematical
point of view on version control. I first found out about it from <code>pijul</code>,
a new version control system (VCS) that is loosely inspired by that paper. But
if you poke around the <code>pijul</code> <a href="https://pijul.com/">home page</a>, you won’t find
many details about what makes it different from existing VCSes. So I did a bit
of digging, and this series of blog posts is the result.</p>

<p>In the first part (i.e. this one), I’ll go over some of the theory developed in
the paper. In particular, I’ll describe a way to think about patches and
merging that is guaranteed to never, ever have a merge conflict. In the second
part, I’ll show how <code>pijul</code> puts that theory into action, and in the third part
I’ll dig into <code>pijul</code>’s implementation.</p>

<p>Before getting into some patch theory, a quick caveat: any real VCS needs to
deal with a lot of tedious details (directories, binary files, file renaming,
etc.). In order to get straight to the interesting new ideas, I’ll be skipping
all that. For the purposes of these posts, a VCS only needs to keep track of
a single file, which you should think of as a list of lines.</p>



<p>A patch is the difference between two files. Later in this series we’ll be
looking at some wild new ideas, so let’s start with something familiar and
comforting. The kind of patches we’ll discuss here go back to the early days of
Unix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a patch works line-by-line (as opposed to, for example, word-by-word); and</li>
  <li>a patch can add new lines, but not modify existing lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to actually have a useful VCS, you need to be able to delete lines
also. But deleting lines turns out to add some complications, so we’ll deal
with them later.</p>

<p>For an example, let’s start with a simple file: my to-do list for this morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_1.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking back at the list, I realize that I forgot something important. Here’s the new one:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>To go from the original to-do list to the new one, I added the line with the
socks. In the format of the original Unix “diff” utility, the patch would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_3.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>The “1a2” line is a code saying that we’re going to add something after line 1 of the
input file, and the next bit is obviously telling us what to insert.</p>

<p>Since this blog isn’t a command line tool, we’ll represent patches with pretty diagrams
instead of flat files. Here’s how we’ll draw the patch above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_4.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Hopefully it’s self-explanatory, but just in case: an arrow goes from left to
right to indicate that the line on the right is the same as the one on the
left. Lines on the right with no arrow coming in are the ones that got added.
Since patches aren’t allowed to re-order the lines, the lines are guaranteed
not to cross.</p>

<p>There’s something implicit in our notation that really needs to be said out
loud: for us, <b>a patch is tied to a specific input file</b>. This is the first point
where we diverge from the classic Unix ways: the classic Unix patch that we
produced using “diff” could in principle be applied to <em>any</em> input file, and it
would still insert “* put on socks” after the first line. In many cases that
wouldn’t be what you want, but sometimes it is.</p>



<p>The best thing about patches is that they can enable multiple people to edit
the same file and then merge their changes afterwards. Let’s suppose that my
wife also decides to put things on my to-do list: she
takes the original file and adds a line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_5.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now there are two new versions of my to-do list: mine with the socks, and my
wife’s with the garbage. Let’s draw them all together:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_6.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This brings us to merging: since I’d prefer to have my to-do list as a single
file, I want to merge my wife’s changes and my own. In this example, it’s
pretty obvious what the result should be, but let’s look at the general problem
of merging. We’ll do this slowly and carefully, and our endpoint might be
different from what you’re used to.</p>

<h2 id="patch-composition">Patch composition</h2>

<p>First, I need to introduce some notation for an obvious concept: the
<em>composition</em> of two patches is the patch that you would get by applying one
patch and then applying the other. Since a “patch” for us also includes the
original file, you can’t just compose any two old patches. If <code>p</code> is a patch
taking the file <code>O</code> to the file <code>A</code> and <code>r</code> is a patch taking <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>, then
you can compose the two (but only in one order!) to obtain a patch from <code>O</code> to
<code>B</code>. I’ll write this composition as <code>pr</code>: first apply <code>p</code>, then <code>r</code>.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to visualize patch composition using our diagrams: to compute
the composition of two paths, just “follow the arrows”</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_7.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>to get the (dotted red) patch going from <code>O</code> to <code>B</code>.</p>

<h2 id="merging-as-composition">Merging as composition</h2>

<p>I’m going to define carefully what a merge is in terms of patch composition.
I’ll do this in a very math-professor kind of way: I’ll give a precise
definition, followed by some examples, and only afterwards will I explain
why the definition makes sense.
So here’s the definition: if <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are two different patches
taking the file <code>O</code> to the files <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively, a <em>merge</em> of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
is a pair of patches <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> such that</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>r</code> and <code>s</code> take <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively to a common output file <code>M</code>, and</li>
  <li><code>pr = qs</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can illustrate this definition with a simple diagram, where the capital
letters denote files, and the lower-case letters are patches going between
them:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_8.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Instead of saying that <code>pr = qs</code>, a mathematician (or anyone who wants
to sound fancy) would say that the diagram above <em>commutes</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_9.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And here is an example of something that is not a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_10.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a merge because it fails the condition <code>pr = qs</code>: composing the
patches along the top path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_11.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>but composing them along the bottom path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_12.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Specifically, the two patches disagree on which of the shoes in the final list
came from the original file. This is the real meaning underlying the condition
<code>pr = qs</code>: it means that there will never be any ambiguity about which lines
came from where. If you’re used to using <code>blame</code> or <code>annotate</code> commands with
your favorite VCS, you can probably imagine why this sort of ambiguity would be
bad.</p>

<h2 id="a-historical-note">A historical note</h2>

<p>Merging patches is an old idea, of course, and so I just want to briefly
explain how the presentation above differs from “traditional” merging:
traditionally, merging was defined by algorithms (of which there are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Merge_algorithms">many</a>). These algorithms would try to automatically find a good merge; if
they couldn’t, you would be asked to supply one instead.</p>

<p>We’ll take a different approach: instead of starting with an algorithm, we’ll
start with a list of properties that we want a good merge to satisfy. At the end,
we’ll find that there’s a unique merge that satisfies all these properties
(and fortunately for us, there will also be an efficient algorithm to find it).</p>



<p>The main problem with merges is that they aren’t unique. This isn’t a huge
problem by itself: lots of great things aren’t unique. The problem is that we
usually want to merge automatically, and an automatic system needs an
unambiguous answer. Eventually, we’ll deal with this by defining a special
class of merges (called perfect merges) which will be unique. Before that,
we’ll explore the problem with some examples.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with a silly example, in which our merge tool decides to
add some extra nonsense:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_13.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>No sane merge tool would ever do that, of course, but it’s still a valid
merge according to our rule in the last section. Clearly, we’ll have
to tighten up the rules to exclude this case.</p>

<h2 id="a-serious-example">A serious example</h2>

<p>Here is a more difficult situation with two merges that are actually
reasonable:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_14.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Both of these merges are valid according to our rules above, but you need to
actually know what the lines <em>mean</em> in order to decide that the first merge is
better (especially if it’s raining outside). Any reasonable automatic merging
tool would refuse to choose, instead requiring its user to do the merge
manually.</p>

<p>The examples above are pretty simple, but how would you decide in general
whether a merge is unambiguous and can be performed automatically? In existing
tools, the details depend on the merging algorithm. Since we started off with
a non-algorithmic approach, let’s see where that leads: instead of specifying
explicitly which merges we can do, we’ll describe the properties that an ideal
merge should have.</p>



<p>The main idea behind the
definition I’m about to give is that it will never cause any regrets. That is,
no matter what happens in the future, we can always represent the history just
as well through the merge as we could using the original branches. Obviously,
that’s a nice property to have; personally, I think it’s non-obvious why it’s
a good choice as the <em>defining</em> property of the ideal merge, but we’ll get to
that later.</p>

<p>Ok, here it comes. Consider a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_15.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And now suppose that the original creators of patches <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
continued working on their own personal branches, which merged sometime in
the future at the file <code>F</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_16.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>We say that the merge <code>(r, s)</code> is a <em>perfect merge</em> if for <em>every</em> possible
choice of the merge <code>(u, v)</code>, there is a unique patch <code>w</code> so that <code>u = rw</code>
and <code>v = sw</code>. (In math terms, the diagram commutes.)
We’re going to call <code>w</code> a <em>continuation</em>, since it tells us how to continue
working from the merged file. To repeat, a merge is perfect if for every
possible future, there is a unique continuation.</p>

<h2 id="a-perfect-merge">A perfect merge</h2>

<p>Let’s do a few examples to explore the various corners of our definition.
First, an example of a perfect merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_17.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>It takes a bit of effort to actually <em>prove</em> that this is a perfect merge;
I’ll leave that as an exercise. It’s more interesting to see some examples
that fail to be perfect.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example-1">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the silly example of a merge that introduced an unnecessary
line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_18.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This turns out (surprise, surprise) not to be a perfect merge.
To understand how our definition of merge perfection excludes merges like this,
here is an example of a possible future without a continuation:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_19.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Since our patches can’t delete lines, there’s no way to get from <code>merged</code>
to <code>future</code>.</p>

<p>Today’s developers are expected to develop resilient and scalable 
distributed systems. Systems that are easy to patch in the face of 
security concerns and easy to do low-risk incremental upgrades. Systems 
that benefit from software reuse and innovation of the open source 
model. Achieving all of this for different languages, using a variety of
 application frameworks with embedded libraries is not possible.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/multi-runtime-microservice-architecture/" rel="external" target="_blank">blogged</a>
 about “Multi-Runtime Microservices Architecture” where I have explored 
the needs of distributed systems such as lifecycle management, advanced 
networking, resource binding, state abstraction and how these 
abstractions have been changing over the years. I also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPEIJFJV9k" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;“The
 Evolution of Distributed Systems on Kubernetes” covering how Kubernetes
 Operators and the sidecar model are acting as the primary innovation 
mechanisms for delivering the same distributed system primitives.</p>
<p>On both occasions, the main takeaway is the prediction that the 
progression of software application architectures on Kubernetes moves 
towards the sidecar model managed by operators. Sidecars and operators 
could become a mainstream software distribution and consumption model 
and in some cases even replace software libraries and frameworks as we 
are used to.</p>
<p>The sidecar model allows the composition of applications written in 
different languages to deliver joint value, faster and without the 
runtime coupling. Let’s see a few concrete examples of sidecars and 
operators, and then we will explore how this new software composition 
paradigm could impact us.</p>
<h2>Out-of-Process Smarts on the Rise</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes, a sidecar is one of the <a href="http://k8spatterns.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">core design patterns</a>
 achieved easily by organizing multiple containers in a single Pod. The 
Pod construct ensures that the containers are always placed on the same 
node and can cooperate by interacting over networking, file system or 
other IPC methods. And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/" rel="external" target="_blank">operators</a>
 allow the automation, management and integration of the sidecars with 
the rest of the platform. The sidecars represent a language-agnostic, 
scalable data plane offering distributed primitives to custom 
applications. And the operators represent their centralized management 
and control plane.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few popular manifestations of the sidecar model.</p>
<h3>Envoy</h3>
<p>Service Meshes such as Istio, Consul, and others are using transparent service proxies such as <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Envoy</a>
 for delivering enhanced networking capabilities for distributed 
systems. Envoy can improve security, it enables advanced traffic 
management, improves resilience, adds deep monitoring and tracing 
features. Not only that, it understands more and more Layer 7 protocols 
such as Redis, MongoDB, MySQL and most recently Kafka. It also added 
response caching capabilities and even WebAssembly support that will 
enable all kinds of custom plugins. Envoy is an example of how a 
transparent service proxy adds advanced networking capabilities to a 
distributed system without including them into the runtime of the 
distributed application components.</p>
<h3>Skupper</h3>
<p>In addition to the typical service mesh, there are also projects, such as<a href="https://skupper.io/" rel="external" target="_blank"> Skupper</a>,
 that ship application networking capabilities through an external 
agent. Skupper solves multicluster Kubernetes communication challenges 
through a Layer 7 virtual network and offers advanced routing and 
connectivity capabilities. But rather than embedding Skupper into the 
business service runtime, it runs an instance per Kubernetes namespace 
which acts as a shared sidecar.</p>
<h3>Cloudstate</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudstate.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Cloudstate</a>
 is another example of the sidecar model, but this time for providing 
stateful abstractions for the serverless development model. It offers 
stateful primitives over GRPC for EventSourcing, CQRS, Pub/Sub, 
Key/Value stores and other use cases. Again, it an example of sidecars 
and operators in action but this time for the serverless programming 
model.</p>
<h3>Dapr</h3>
<p><a href="https://dapr.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dapr</a>
 is a relatively young project started by Microsoft, and it is also 
using the sidecar model for providing developer-focused distributed 
system primitives. Dapr offers abstractions for state management, 
service invocation and fault handling, resource bindings, pub/sub, 
distributed tracing and others. Even though there is some overlap in the
 capabilities provided by Dapr and Service Mesh, both are very different
 in nature. Envoy with Istio is injected and runs transparently from the
 service and represents an operational tool. Dapr, on the other hand, 
has to be called explicitly from the application runtime over HTTP or 
gRPC and it is an explicit sidecar targeted for developers. It is a 
library for distributed primitives that is distributed and consumed as a
 sidecar, a model that may become very attractive for developers 
consuming distributed capabilities.</p>
<h3>Camel K</h3>
<p>Apache Camel is a mature integration library that rediscovers itself on Kubernetes. Its subproject <a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Camel K</a>
 uses heavily the operator model to improve the developer experience and
 integrate deeply with the Kubernetes platform. While Camel K does not 
rely on a sidecar, through its CLI and operator it is able to reuse the 
same application container and execute any local code modification in a 
remote Kubernetes cluster in less than a second. This is another example
 of developer-targeted software consumption through the operator model.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>And these are only some of the pioneer projects exploring various 
approaches through sidecars and operators. There is more work being done
 to reduce the networking overhead introduced by container-based 
distributed architectures such as the data plane development kit (<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">DPDK</a>),
 which is a userspace application that bypasses the layers of the Linux 
kernel networking stack and access directly to the network hardware. 
There is work in the Kubernetes project to create <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753" rel="external" target="_blank">sidecar</a> containers with more granular lifecycle guarantees. There are new Java projects based on GraalVM implementation such as <a href="https://quarkus.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Quarkus</a>
 that reduce the resource consumption and application startup time which
 makes more workloads attractive for sidecars. All of these innovations 
will make the side-car model more attractive and enable the creation of 
even more such projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/d/multiruntine1.png"><img alt="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" data-original-height="944" data-original-width="1670" height="226" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/w400-h226/multiruntine1.png" title="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" width="400"></a></p><p>Sidecars providing distributed systems primitives</p>
<p>I’d not be surprised to see projects coming up around more specific 
use cases such as stateful orchestration of long-running processes such 
as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) engines in sidecars. Job 
schedulers in sidecars. Stateless integration engines i.e. Enterprise 
Integration Patterns implementations in sidecars. Data abstractions and 
data <a href="https://github.com/teiid/teiid-operator" rel="external" target="_blank">federation</a> engines in sidecars. OAuth2/<a href="https://github.com/louketo/louketo-proxy" rel="external" target="_blank">OpenID</a>
 proxy in sidecars. Scalable database connection pools for serverless 
workloads in sidecars. Application networks as sidecars, etc. But why 
would software vendors and developers switch to this model? Let’s see a 
few of the benefits it provides.</p>
<h2>Runtimes with Control Planes over Libraries</h2>
<p>If you are a software vendor today, probably you have already 
considered offering your software to potential users as an API or a 
SaaS-based solution. This is the fastest software consumption model and a
 no-brainer to offer, when possible. Depending on the nature of the 
software you may be also distributing your software as a library or a 
runtime framework. Maybe it is time to consider if it can be offered as a
 container with an operator too. This mechanism of distributing software
 and the resulting architecture has some very unique benefits that the 
library mechanism cannot offer.</p>
<h3>Supporting Polyglot Consumers</h3>
<p>By offering libraries to be consumable through open protocols and 
standards, you open them up for all programming languages. A library 
that runs as a sidecar and consumable over HTTP, using a text format 
such as JSON does not require any specific client runtime library. Even 
when gRPC and Protobuf are used for low-latency and high-performance 
interactions, it is still easier to generate such clients than including
 third party custom libraries in the application runtime and implement 
certain interfaces.</p>
<h3>Application Architecture Agnostic</h3>
<p>The explicit sidecar architecture (as opposed to the transparent one)
 is a way of software capability consumption as a separate runtime 
behind a developer-focused API. It is an orthogonal feature that can be 
added to any application whether that is monolithic, microservices, 
functions-based, actor-based or anything in between. It can sit next to a
 monolith in a less dynamic environment, or next to every microservice 
in a dynamic cloud-based environment. It is trivial to create sidecars 
on Kubernetes, and doable on many other software orchestration platforms
 too.</p>
<h3>Tolerant to Release Impedance Mismatch</h3>
<p>Business logic is always custom and developed in house. Distributed 
system primitives are well-known commodity features, and consumed 
off-the-shelf as either platform features or runtime libraries. You 
might be consuming software for state abstractions, messaging clients, 
networking resiliency and monitoring libraries, etc. from third-party 
open source projects or companies. And these third party entities have 
their release cycles, critical fixes, CVE patches that impact your 
software release cycles too. When third party libraries are consumed as a
 separate runtime (sidecar), the upgrade process is simpler as it is 
behind an API and it is not coupled with your application runtime. The 
release impedance mismatch between your team and the consumed 3rd party 
libraries vendors becomes easier to manage.</p>
<h3>Control Plane Included Mentality</h3>
<p>When a feature is consumed as a library, it is included in your 
application runtime and it becomes your responsibility to understand how
 it works, how to configure, monitor, tune and upgrade. That is because 
the language runtimes (such as the JVM) and the runtime frameworks (such
 as Spring Boot or application servers) dictate how a third-party 
library can be included, …</p></div></div>

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [PHP-DEV] Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows</p>
<p>My name is Dale Hirt and I am the project manager for PHP inside Microsoft. <br>
We are not, however, going to be supporting PHP for Windows in any capacity for version 8.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>Hi Dale! <br>
First, let me convey all our appreciation for the work Microsoft has put into supporting PHP on Windows over the years.  Thank you also for letting us know in advance to not expect 8.0 builds.  I guess this decision must have only been made very recently since 8.0.0alpha1 and alpha2 builds were produced already.</p>
<p>I won't say I'm not bummed, of course.  Nevertheless, y'all gotta do what you gotta do.  I'm sure we can work out an alternative by the end of the year.</p>
<p>All the best, <br>
-Sara Golemon (PHP 8.0 Release Manager)</p>

"Now you're gonna make me cry." In a wide-sweeping conversation he recalls the roots of his curiosity, and they days when he's build wood block cities with his grandma.</p><div><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491446.1583781956!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/frank-gehry.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>At 91, architect Frank Gehry is still dreaming up and working on new projects. "There's always something new to chase after, some new corner to turn around and go around."<!-- --> <!-- -->(Mike Blake/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p><span></span><span>Listen<!-- --> to the full episode</span><span>54:27</span></p><p><span><p>It's pretty easy to spot a Frank Gehry building: all curves and glass and movement.</p>  <p>He'll tell you his designs — from the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles — "speak" to the buildings and environment around them. But to the onlooker, they clearly stand apart.&nbsp;</p>    <p>In the latest episode of <em>More&nbsp;with Anna Maria Tremonti</em>, it also becomes clear that Gehry sees his buildings as a way to bring people together,&nbsp;and sees his own role in life as much more than an architect. In a wide-sweeping conversation, he traces his craft back to the days when his grandmother would encourage him to build cities out of&nbsp;wood blocks&nbsp;for the fire — an act of imagination he's adapted for&nbsp;students of today.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>The following excerpt from their conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. Find the full interview here or on your favourite podcast app.</em></p>  <p><strong>As I listen to you I hear that you are so much more than an architect. That you care&nbsp;about more than the building of buildings.</strong></p>  <p>I do, yeah. Well I grew up that way.</p>  <p>You know my grandfather used to read Talmud to me. I don't think he was&nbsp;sellout religious. He was just interested in the philosophy. And Talmud starts with the word "Why." It's about curiosity. And I think that is really important. You've got to be curious.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Buildings are backgrounds for activity but the activity has to be&nbsp;a life, a thing. It's got to be more than just making money. It's a cultural thing and it brings people together to talk to each other, live together, work together. So, just the building alone is not that relevant.</p>  <p><strong>Do you think that most architects understand that? Most people?</strong></p>  <p>Not most.&nbsp;I don't think so.</p>  <p>Although architects tend to be idealists. They start out very idealistic. They want to make the world better. Most of the architects I know and work with have an idealistic base. They're trying to make a better world.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/frank-gehry.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/frank-gehry.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/frank-gehry.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/frank-gehry.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/frank-gehry.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/frank-gehry.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>People pass in front of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim Museum at dusk in Bilbao.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How important was your family life in creating the man who you are today? Those early days when you were a kid.</strong></p>  <p>Okay, so now you're gonna make me cry. Well my grandparents were great. My grandmother brought the wood blocks home for the fire, for the wood stove. And she would throw them on the floor and make cities with me.</p>    <p>And I don't know why she decided to do that. Architecture wasn't in any part of our family at that time. So that was an&nbsp;important memory.</p>  <p>My father was not educated at all. He probably didn't even go to school. He was living on the streets in New York — Tenth Avenue. His father was a tailor who came from Russia and is actually buried in Toronto. And his name was Frank Goldberg. So there is a Frank Goldberg buried in a cemetery in Toronto — that's my grandfather.</p>  <p>Anyway, so my father ...&nbsp;had a heart attack at 49. He lost everything. And his brother moved him to L.A.</p>  <p>We got here and we were very poor because he had lost everything. But he became a truck driver and I became a truck driver. I was 17 or 18. Now, after he's gone — he died at 63 or something like that — I've seen evidence now that I find in some of the things he left behind, that we never looked at really until recently, and it's pretty clear that he had an artistic bent and that that's what he liked doing.</p>  <p>He would paint toys for people. He would make things.&nbsp;I remember him drawing with me but he never got to see what I started to do. By time I was an architect, he was out of it.</p>  <p><strong>What do you think you would have thought of your work? Would he have been proud of you?</strong></p>  <p>He would be shocked and proud. I think, yeah. I liked that thought.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>So, what advice do you give to your son as he tries to carve his own path?</strong></p>  <p>Just stay curious. Do where your head takes you. And be conscious of the people who are working with you and the people who are you're working for and the importance of what you do in relation to your contribution to what's going on around us.</p>  <p><strong>That sounds like advice you could give to lots of people.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. Well, I'm not holier than thou about it.&nbsp;I know that I just live that way. But there's a lot of different ways to live and still be creative and still be part of the world and still be doing important things. So my way is not the only example.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Well, I think in these times though it's nice to hear you know to connect the work you do and the wider concept of architecture to the idea of humanity and being humane.</strong> <strong>I think it's a really important thing to hear from you.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. But I think the history of architecture shows that that was prevalent from the beginning.</p>  <p>You know all the great artists of the Renaissance became architects. So Giotto was a great painter, became an architect. El Greco was a great painter, became an architect. Architecture was treated as an art in those times.</p>    <p>After the war here architecture became less of an art and more&nbsp;engineering issues and financial issues. And not that they're not important but that became the driver. Not the humanity of it. And that's why our cities are kind of the way they are I think. And the cities look the same all over the world. You go to Seoul, Korea. It looks like downtown L.A.</p>  <p><strong>Do you see yourself as an artist more than an architect?</strong></p>  <p>Absolutely. I hope so.&nbsp;I think it's the same. They're not mutually exclusive. When I got out of school, I hung out with the artists more than with the architects because I just felt that's where I should be. And I still do.</p>    <div>   <h2>Want to hear the full conversation?</h2>   <p>Listen for free at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/more-with-anna-maria-tremonti/index.html">cbc.ca/more</a>&nbsp;or on your favourite podcast app — including&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/more-with-anna-maria-tremonti/id1494930679">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL3BvZGNhc3RpbmcvaW5jbHVkZXMvbW9yZS54bWw%3D">Google Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/17PsCUS5j6WN1GiqBGDIxn">Spotify</a>.

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>

<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>

<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<p>If we want to expose our container to world but it is important for us that container has got own IP and MAC adress from network where docker host is connected, we can use MACVLAN network driver. It allows also to connect to certain VLAN.</p>
<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>
<li>you have to set network card in promiscious mode</li>
<li>this solution is created mainly for legacy apps or network monitoring apps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="important">Important!</h3>
<p>To use MACVLAN mode our network card has to be in promiscious mode!<br>
Activiting promoscius mode in CentOS(ens18 is my main network card):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are several ways to host an application on the internet, but the one that I am most familiar with is to use a web server such as Apache or NGINX where you can host all the static components of your application and also use it as a reverse proxy server to direct API calls.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>But recently I came across another way to host a web application which is more elegant, cost effective and has no need for maintenance. This method makes use of AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront and it’s turned out to be significantly easier to set up, scales infinitely and is cheaper than the alternative.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Why did we need S3 to host a web application?</strong><br></h4><p>The <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> that I have built is currently architected in this way - we use an open source version of Nginx that is hosted on an AWS VPS instance which takes care of hosting our static files for our web app and also works as a reverse proxy server to send API calls to our backend applications.</p><p>This setup worked great so far because we have a limited number of users that need access to the application dashboard and there is no need for a CDN either because the users, especially the ones on a paid plan do not have any problem waiting a couple of seconds more for the website to load.</p><p>This requirement changed when there was a new feature requirement within our product. Our users are e-commerce merchants and most of them accept “Cash on delivery” as an option while accepting orders and this leaves a lot of room for fraud to occur where somebody places an order and selects the payment method as “Cash on delivery” without the intention to actually buy the product.</p><p>In order to fix this we introduced a feature where the customer who places a COD order gets an automated message on WhatsApp to confirm their order via a link.</p><figure id="w-node-c4a1f5223dce-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c3967fc45b644bd89_23sxkg2VnH0KczPacTa60TpnJXRd675pY-TD7m1i8DzhDDZvosqX5cXv9tXTpgyHrF6Rd_PM_-xv37qWKFQOsc6Bx818rC_OcCfJxhfHC-FojE8HjpC9EXqQL_jVq8DJbeIynX31.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Automated WhatsApp message to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on this link would open this web page</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-11a95fb1ed82-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951bd3ce595371f24095_FScpPINWKrHotUgTY8aLaV9wlay9dcXXurWkK_Ce-jcsF07e5bxofrU9qjaSspkf5UvCAE40CvgKZ57KouSas0GsPBF_RHbLppjgiOhpGqLN0LbQiVIGd0f7yV9pw9pc2g5t6nEP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Reactjs web app used to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Now this web page would be accessed by the customers that buy from the merchants that use our application, so the traffic to this page could be very erratic, not to mention the fact that it would come from various parts of the world where the users internet connection would also be erratic and vary according to the region.</p><p>Therefore it did not make sense to host this web page the way the rest of our application is hosted. This web app had the following requirements</p><ul role="list"><li>High availability from any part of the world</li><li>Fast load time</li><li>Ability to handle any amount of traffic</li><li>Not having the need to manage or monitor</li></ul><p>It turns out that all of these things can be achieved if you host the app using a combination of S3 and CloudFront which is the CDN offered by AWS.</p><h4><strong>How to host an application on s3</strong><br></h4><p>There is a comprehensive guide in the AWS documentation on how to do this - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html" target="_blank">link to documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The TL:DR for this is to Create an s3 bucket with the same name as the domain/subdomain where you want to host your web app.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, our web page had to be hosted on<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a>, so this is what the s3 bucket would be called. After this there are a bunch of properties and settings that you would have to change on the bucket which are mentioned in the doc.&nbsp;</p><p>Once this is done, you can test whether it worked or not by using either of the below links based on the region where you are hosted</p><figure id="w-node-30ce7d6ec647-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c849c2b0521c7c2f0_AToH07QToYYzbJ9Hj3iliaW3JMuv0_jHNoaEopFciAvlAf-Ajqr0VpnnKS22_3du4E4vmnV-5Eh3fLajnyQ48kEFHFGjwpKVa_wTl7EXOQu2ZrOX_OgbBq1ba08CWAgeUKTuN0no.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>End points for verifying if the s3 hosting worked or not</figcaption></figure><p>Though the steps in the AWS doc are quite comprehensive, there is one gotcha here that you must keep in mind. If your web app runs on a framework like react which is what we are using, you must make sure that under the “static website hosting” settings of the AWS bucket, you set the index document as well as error document as index.html.</p><figure id="w-node-bc6f0af8aa89-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ce32edcd6fc8e8c88_JNhV0zwqHr-nOGJWip4t3WDyp9wB8Ld7aXF3KHr30jHAeKpRQVkB_gUIG-Z911vMOLNRZplgM7vUasVAs5Wm7NUtxkTZS6-HI9YzPh2I78EAwCEezHDfzxR08lDBQu7z4aLBhXSX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>S3 static web hosting settings</figcaption></figure><p>This is to ensure that if you have any URL routes set up in your react application, those routes are honoured.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How to put the s3 application behind a CDN</strong><br></h4><p>The above step only completes one step of the process where your application is now residing in s3. But the process is only complete if the application is accessible as a CDN. For this you would have to use CloudFront and configure it to use your s3 bucket as the source. A comprehensive documentation for this process is given <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few gotchas here as well. The first one being that you will require an SSL certificate to host your application as <strong>https://</strong>. You can get an SSL certificate easily using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/" target="_blank">AWS Certificate manager</a>. This process becomes even more easy if you are using Route53 to manage your domains and subdomains. Even if you use another provider like Godaddy or Bigrock for your domains, I would highly recommend following <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider" target="_blank">these steps</a> to plug in your domains to Route53.&nbsp;</p><p>The other gotcha here is once again something to do with reactjs URL routing. If you are using this in your application, there is another step that you have to follow. Under your CloudFront distribution, you must navigate to error pages and create a new custom error response as follows</p><figure id="w-node-a5d3bf85872d-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c40228a0a31b66d85_Xtn0dT_NkHLal0TU8T9vqg_t9AGSxaLs9wvMlIbGxfXCIrH7coSBdYVtZQdkiJJI6oj6WtfPpMjYius2H4gDZrX1_29_TwlPOiHrWeB24cS65VzitHgu9yK5U43S0ByQf3Z4l7uc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution error pages settings</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-283c3bc077ec-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c8fbf67d9dc26bd63_XTsEDUFowLfUmq3r3YixmsOrB-fMsmIqSr2r5HiymcBaBxt79EQiVT-1qZM3Aps7l27IZNzbSDSxRCZ-FV7HPUu3utQckFitE1tjnr_Stn9YA_HSgjwjB-rQwiD6lC48o0BhiBVg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution handling 403 error</figcaption></figure><p>This will ensure that if the CDN is not able to find the URL path you specify, it will default to index.html which will handle the routing in case of a reactjs application.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing all these steps you will receive a url for your CloudFront distribution that looks something like this -<a href="https://dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank"> dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net</a>. You just need to use this URL as an alias and map it to your domain/subdomain which in our case is<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a></p><figure id="w-node-ec229573544f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ccd92d9716216562a_S_OJrarz5VxJWIVBHKu-wpg2Ine5qGjwdGzIb0Ban3S5Ya41_TbycPcpfnL5IQbu73mNS7oMmqNsrTQjatzC1qUSgsuy5q_CGEL25PITgZlWNJ3xUouo0G-DkloWeR_zPIfW9qA2.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Route53 subdomain targeting</figcaption></figure><p>And that’s it, it's done! You now have a highly available application which does not need to be monitored or managed. Once you launch your application this way, it is now on a CDN and if you have to update the application in the future, the CDN cache must be invalidated for the changes to take effect. This can be done under the “invalidations” tab.</p><figure id="w-node-4a1c808b9f87-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c64584095bc4b3701_5oYoQ3CFjxE69GyZKHZ1HlboCYnrtEcRAZok14fLisD0VU7JCm1s3416Q5roMUIWFy-XX7PzNWwXQ3ogLygpMhV1AsPciPjqGAs9E9Dyx1drA9qLf6GmDCN_1otqPOhMwJ3ep9ei.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront cache invalidation</figcaption></figure><p>Then supply all the paths that have been updated and you would like the CDN cache to invalidate.

		<p>I just wanted to write this to start the conversation in order to disrupt amateur radio’s status quo, in response to K0NR’s blog, “<em><a href="http://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2017/11/internet-destroying-amateur-radio/">Is The Internet Destroying Amateur Radio?</a></em>” This was a great analysis by Bob, and it really paints a picture of the current state of the hobby, including the apparent distaste for internet-connected amateur radio technologies.</p>
<p>And also because nobody else has had an article with this title, so why not?&nbsp; Despite being clickbait, the title isn’t wrong. Millennials are definitely killing ham radio, just like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8">they’re killing everything else.</a> Here’s how.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am 25 years old. Also and this blog is a rant, full of unverifiable anecdotes and wild propositions, probably a few spelling errors, and many incoherent thoughts. Opinions are my own. QRZ OM’s beware.</p>

<p>The Hobbiest Computer movement of the 80s (all of you with a TRS-80) is now the hacker/maker movement, automating life with microcontrollers, tiny computers, and data centers.</p>
<p>Amateur radio is to The Baby Boomer and Generation X’s youth as IOT is to Millennials and Gen Y.</p>
<p>Interest in “talking to people on the radio” is waning; it’s about talking to machines, and enabling machines to talk to us. That’s why the maker movement is such a hit, especially now as commercial entities have also entered the fray with off the shelf IoT devices. I’m thankful for the the ARRL for realizing this critical market, and repping ham radio at many Makerfaires and Hackercons.</p>

<p>China controls hardware development and manufacturing. We (the US (Silicon Valley)) specialize in software. Homebrewing hardware from scratch isn’t going to be a thing in the next 20 years, because the ashes of failed electronic appliances from which many a ham radio Phoenix was born are no longer durable, salvageable, salvageable goods – once dead and broken, they’re trash.</p>
<p>Now is the time of software homebrewing, and the idea of ham radio as a means to an end.</p>
<p>The evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heathkit, despite their resurrection, can’t figure their $h!+ out. They just can’t. Other kit companies (like Ramsey) have shut down, as well as Radioshack.</li>
<li>Elecraft stopped making thru-hole kits in favor of assembly projects with pre-populated surface-mount PCBs. Many other outfits stopped kit building entirely, because it’s just cheaper to have China do all of the fab and assembly.</li>
<li>Software defined radio, in general, is dominating the radio communications market, both from a hobbyist perspective (RTLSDR, HackRF), an academic one (GNURadio, USRP) to commercial and military (to name a few: cell phones, airband radios; weather, civil air, and tactical radar systems; radio observatories;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network">&nbsp;MANET</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Tactical_Information_Distribution_System">JTIDS</a>)</li>
<li>The non-traditional sense of ham radio is quickly becoming a centerpiece, if not a regular side-item, of <a href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>&nbsp;articles, makerspaces, and makerfaires.</li>
</ol>
<p>However,&nbsp; I will admit the <a href="https://heilsound.com/amateur-radio-post/the-pine-board-project/">Ham Nation Pineboard project</a> is particularly popular, and is doing a great thing bringing tubes back into focus and captivating/inspiring viewers to try it themselves, but I’m going out on a limb saying it’s probably most popular with their target demographic…a young person might be following along but it’s not changing the face of the hobby anytime soon. One of the student members of&nbsp; W0EEE (Missouri S&amp;T) is a die-hard tube fanatic, but to everyone else, he’s the tube guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of which – target demographic. The target demographic of every single amateur radio show, podcast, club, media outlet, society, magazine, livestream, or otherwise, is not young people.</p>
<p>The ARRL however, has been making a lot of good strides to engage the new generation of hams (<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-expands-initiative-to-fire-up-collegiate-amateur-radio-clubs">1</a>)(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/arrlhq/">2</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-now-on-snapchat">3</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-represented-at-world-maker-fair-in-new-york-city-school-club-to-exhibit">4</a>), yet still, the ARRL can only do so much to interest younger people, which takes away resources from engaging their demographic core of white male retirees.&nbsp; For example – why no youth editor? I was the last one, before my editor, Khrystyne K1SFA, left the ARRL, which left a hole requiring them to kill the Youth Editor (<a href="http://n0ssc.com/blogs/arrlyouthcolumns">the articles still remain on their website</a>), and The Amateur Amateur (<a href="http://gary-ross-hoffman.com/Ham/index.html">which still exists at his website</a>). But why no top-level Youth Coordinator? Why not a report on the effort of, or a collaboration between, our Section Youth Coordinators in the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-organization">ARRL Field Organization Structure</a>? Are we all just relying on <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/carole-perry-wb2mgp-set-to-host-her-30th-hamvention-youth-forum">Carole Perry</a>‘s and the late <a href="http://oralhistory.boulderlibrary.org/interview/oh1264/">Ellie and Rip Van Winkel’s</a>&nbsp;of the ham radio world to inspire and educate young people about ham radio? Surely there’s opportunity for ARRL, as well as every ham radio club out there.</p>

<p>No. From my experience over the last seven years, digital Amateur Radio is not intrinsically exciting to young people, as many have been touting. It is a lot better than voice and CW, but still exists the fact that as an individual, it’s a troubling process to decide where to spend your (mother’s) money – $300 on a DSTAR radio, $100 for a DMR, both full of people talking about how robotic they sound, or $400 for an HF station to do digital data modes, full of canned responses (PSK31) or hardly any response at all (FT8).</p>
<p>These are also communication between people, which begs the titular question posed by K0NR. People-to-people communication is trivial, and although some young hams (me) find it really cool to talk to people beyond shouting distance with the raw elements of a radio station,what’s much more interesting and impactful to the next generation is is the idea of people-to-machine communication. In other words, Digital Voice is dumb, Digital Data is smart, and the only ways to utilize digital data are explicitly NOT provided by the commercial manufacturers of amateur radio(1), but instead by Adafruit, Ubiquiti; HackRF, RFSpace, and USRP; and soon <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">FaradayRF</a>, among others.</p>

<h2>Remote Operating for HF</h2>
<p>Here’s where I disagree with K0NR’s analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, we can’t really stop the impact of new technology. Oh, I suppose the amateur radio community could petition the FCC to restrict [internet assisted] use of ham radio. There could be regulations that limit the use of the internet being interconnected with Part 97 radio operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that remote operating, and other internet-assisted means of ham radio operation, are critical to youth engagement.</p>
<p>RemoteHamRadio is the shining example of where ham radio operating is heading. they have an awesome <a href="http://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/">Youth Program</a>, allowing young people that are:</p>
<p>– 25 years old or younger<br>– A General class or higher license<br>– A member of the ARRL<br>– Interested in or Experienced with in DXing/Contesting</p>
<p>to operate remote online stations for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.remotehams.com/">Remote Hams</a> is a totally free alternative, but it’s up to the host to restrict operation, which is frustrating when you’re clicking through servers, only to find it’s locked by membership to whatever radio club is hosting it.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a> and <a href="http://sdr.hu/openwebrx">OpenWebRX</a> are always open to everyone to receive tons of spectrum, remotely.</p>
<p>Despite that, it’s ultimately a much MUCH better solution in the short term for young hams to operate remotely, than it is to persuade their mom’s to fork up a relative ton of money for a radio, antenna, a pole if no trees are around…etc.</p>
<p>Because young people do not often have access to the the kind of money an HF radio station requires, I strongly believe to captivate more young people, we need to do more of one of these two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Promote your club’s shack, your own shack to young people.</li>
<li>Put your shack on a remote service provider for others to use when you’re not.</li>
</ol>
<p>For young people to join the hobby, it’s critically important to&nbsp;<strong>bring ham radio where the young people are,&nbsp;</strong>which is, for the most part, the internet.</p>
<p>If I knew this when I was younger, my mom would have been around $900 richer!</p>
<h2>Ham Radio Hackathons</h2>
<p>One thing I’m thinking of&nbsp; starting up are Ham Radio Hackathons. I mentioned it<a href="http://n0ssc.com/posts/560-ham-radio-analysis-paralysis"> in a previous blog</a> which has surprisingly gotten a lot of traction with my <a href="http://n0ssc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/T2miAyF.png">tiny contingent of readers</a>.</p>
<p>A hackathon isn’t a coding competition. It’s explained well in <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601">this Medium article.</a> It goes even further than that, not limited to coders and engineers, but open to thinkers, doers, philosophers, system engineers, math people, teachers, students, artists, stakeholders…anyone with an interest in <strong>solving a problem with technology. </strong></p>
<p>Ham radio has a bunch of problems with technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s far behind the curve. We’re spitting out digital modes faster than K9PG can work a sweep, but compared to what’s already on the shelf, why would anyone bother with ham radio?</li>
<li>When I think about software like Log4OM, LOTW, eQSL, and HRD, I get frustrated. It’s great software, and many volunteer hours have poured into their development, but it’s so feature dense, developed in vacuums, hard to use, buggy, and lacking in UX.&nbsp; A good example of software is Fldigi – it’s fast, and light…hence *<strong>FL*</strong>digi. APRS is really nifty, especially <a href="http://aprs.fi/">aprs.fi</a>, but a person needs too much stuff or really expensive radios to get on it via RF (most people seem to be going direct to APRS-IS anyway) and getting into the development side of it is making me pull my hair out, just starting with the fact it’s based on the Bell 202 modem invented in 1972!!! Are you $#!++!n&amp; me!? I mean, what a fantastic utilization of resources…in 1978. <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">It’s time for something fresh, now.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>There are dozens of ham radio websites stuck in 1990 (two of them are in K0NR’s blog (<a href="http://www.on4kst.com/index.php">1</a>)(<a href="http://www.pingjockey.net/">2</a>)…I’d&nbsp; almost argue that ham radio is killing the internet!), it seems like every ham radio developer has to repeatedly reinventing the wheel with logging programs, everyone still uses email reflectors, tons of ham radio apps just crash upon startup, the Digital Voice debate (when we should really focus on digital data, breaking through the baudrate limitation, and interlinking everything), the logistical challenges of testing (3 VEs to proctor a test in person, c’mon…that’s not to say I don’t disagree with the lack of practical on-the-air knowledge in the newbie amateur radio generation; however I don’t think that’s not a fault of the amateur, that’s a fault on the lack of elmership to personally show them how it’s done).</li>
<li>What gets us …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><span>In today’s world of plug-and-play peripheral devices, it is difficult to understand the fundamentals of what is happening at the lower levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the computer connect to the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does it communicate with the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the software make the device do its magic?</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Eric Rangell and I was a teenager in the 1980s.<span>&nbsp; </span>My first computer was an Apple //e in 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before my family got a computer, I learned Basic programming from my brother’s college textbook and practiced writing programs on paper for a year before the Apple found a home in my brother’s room.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the limited computer time I had, I practiced coding, debugging, and refining my programs until they did what I wanted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Apple ][ series of computers was designed so that owners could learn everything about how their machines worked if they took the time to study the available documentation and experiment with the machine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today, early Apple computers can help young people grasp the fundamentals of how a computer works, and that will help them as they progress in their studies and careers.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article I will walk through a simple project that can be built using an Apple ][ series computer that has an internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>It uses one of the Annunciator digital outputs to send MIDI data to a MIDI instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The process of building it and persisting through any problems you encounter will give you a sense of mastery and enjoyment, give you a tool to express your creativity, and challenge you to continue tinkering with the project as you learn more advanced computer science concepts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Parents and teachers are encouraged to learn how to build this project and help children work through it as they build an electronic device, write simple programs in Basic to control the device, and imagine additional applications that can use the device.</span></p>
<p><span>MIDI can play notes and music on keyboard synthesizers, as well as send commands to modules which control music playback, drum patterns, and even lighting.<span>&nbsp; </span>MIDI uses a very simple communication protocol to send binary messages to instruments.<span>&nbsp; </span>There really is nothing magical about it – the computer is just sending bytes which represent commands such as “Play a middle C”, “Stop playing the middle C”, “Change the instrument sound to Violin”, “Change the volume”.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objective of this project is for the student to understand how the computer varies voltage levels on an output port using specific timings according to a protocol that the musical instrument receiving the data understands.<span>&nbsp; </span>By building the interface from scratch, the student knows that the data is traveling on wires that they connected, and controlled by software that they wrote, using a driver program that is conceptually easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start building the interface, read this entire article and gather the parts you need.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many modern musical instruments have USB interfaces for MIDI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look for older synthesizer keyboards with the round 5 pin DIN MIDI sockets, or USB MIDI interfaces that have the round connectors.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may need a MIDI coupler in order to connect a MIDI cable to one of those interfaces.</span></p>

<p><span>The following pictures illustrate various options for connecting the game socket to a breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep track of which pins on the external connector correspond to which pins on the internal connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the Apple //gs, pin 1 is in the upper left corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>For all other Apples, pin 1 is in the lower right corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins are numbered from pin 1 to pin 8, then pin 9 is on the opposite side of pin 8, then pins 9-16 are numbered using the remaining pins.</span></p>

<p><span>1. Test the voltage between +5V (pin 1) and GND (pin 8).<span>&nbsp; </span>Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level coming to the breadboard is at least +5 volts. The red wire connects pin 1 to the side holes for Power and the green wire connects pin 8 to side holes for Ground.

<p><span>You can also test the logic of the </span><span>Annunciators using a Digital Logic Probe, as shown left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Connect the probe terminals to the +5V and GND signals on the breadboard, then touch the tip of the probe to the Annunciator pin.<span>&nbsp; </span>The photos below show how the Digital Logic Probe responds when it detects logical HIGH and logical LOW voltages on Annunciator 0.</span></p>




<p><span><b>Inverters and Buffers</b></span></p>
<p><span>The MIDI specification defines the MIDI OUT Circuit as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>The signal from the transmitting device (labeled UART in the diagram below-left) passes through 2 inverters, then a 220 Ohm resistor, and is sent to Pin 5 on the circular 5 pin DIN connector labelled MIDI OUT.<span>&nbsp; </span>The +5V signal is sent through a 220 Ohm resistor to Pin 4 of the MIDI OUT connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pin 2 is connected to Ground, and the shield of the MIDI cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins 1 and 3 are not connected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Polarity matters because a MIDI cable will connect your MIDI OUT port to the MIDI IN port of a musical instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The signals sent on your MIDI OUT port need to drive a phototransistor inside an opto-isolator in the MIDI IN circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the signal from the UART is negative, the current loop is completed and the opto-isolator receives the signal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communication is established by following a timing protocol for flipping the signals to represent the bits and bytes of MIDI messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this project we will control the timing of the messages with the Apple’s 6502 timing, to illustrate that there is nothing magical going on – if we get the timing right and follow the protocol, we will successfully communicate with a MIDI instrument.</span></p>

<p><span>Inverters change the input signal from HIGH to LOW, or LOW to HIGH.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, two inverters will leave the input signal unchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two inverters form a buffer, which ensures that the signal does not get degraded if voltage fluctuates due to additional loads on the circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>While it may be possible to drive the signal directly from the Apple without using the buffers, that introduces an element of uncertainty that can make your device unreliable under certain conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>So initially we will build the circuit with two inverters (following the MIDI spec), and then test modifying it to use only one inverter (by logically inverting all the signals sent by the driver software).</span></p>

<p>AES67 is a standard for audio over IP developed by the Audio Engineering Society. It enables interoperability between existing standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dante</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAVENNA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q-Lan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livewire_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Livewire</a>.</p>



<h3>Information about AES67</h3>



<p>So how does AES67 actually work? The AES67 Wikipedia page and the AES67 draft from 2017 are a good point to get an overview:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67">Wikipedia Page on AES67</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">AES Standard draft (2017)</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190711055709/http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">archive</a></li></ul>



<p>In summary AES67 consists of three major, already existing standards. The first is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1588-2008.html" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as defined by IEEE 1588-2008</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol on Wikipedia</a>) for clock synchronization. The second is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550" target="_blank">Real-time Transport Protocol</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) with 24-bit PCM as the default audio format transmitted via multicast. The third is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566" target="_blank">Session Description Protocol</a> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2974" target="_blank">Session Announcement Protocol</a> as the transport protocol for session discovery. I suggest to take a look at the standards (sadly IEEE 1588-2008 is behind a paywall) if you want to know how they work, as I won’t be explaining any details here.</p>



<h3>Implementations of the standards</h3>



<p>As the mentioned important standards for AES67 already exists longer than AES67 itself. We do not necessarily need to implement them, as there are already good working implementations out there.</p>



<h4>RTP</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> (also implements PTP and SDP): Open source multimedia framework</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/irtlab/rtptools" target="_blank">rtptools</a>: “set of small applications that can be used for processing RTP data”</li></ul>



<h4>PTPv2</h4>

<h3>Open source software</h3>



<p>Even though AES67 has been around for 6 years, there is not a lot of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;q=AES67&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories" target="_blank">open source software for AES67</a> out there. Open source projects that are related to AES67 which I find most interesting are (in no particular order):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div><section><header><ul><li><svg><use href="/dist/icons/sprite.a2b4f06b8c1f993fbb48608cd2e4d677.svg#calendar-icon"></use></svg><time datetime="2020-07-13 11:17:08.457980237 +0100 WAT"><span>Published on: July 11, 2020</span></time></li></ul><section>I switched away from Google Analytics to Plausible for a better user experience, privacy and performance. As an added advantage, the accuracy of the reported metrics for my website has improved by 30-40%.</section></header><div><article><p>Google analytics has been my go-to analytics tool ever since I became a web
developer a few years ago. It’s the de-facto standard for website usage tracking
and is free to use, feature-rich and easily accessible on web and mobile.
However, over the last couple of months, I contemplated moving away from the
service for some reasons.</p><p>My first gripe with Google Analytics is that the interface is quite slow and
confusing to use. It’s a busy interface and I always have to fumble around to
find the relevant metric I’m looking for. The mobile app is much better in this
regard at least in terms of speed.</p><p>I also realised that I wasn’t even using up to 10% of the features provided by
the service. For the most part, all I cared about is the number of visitors,
page views, and where visitors are coming from (search engines, social media
e.t.c.) so all the other metrics that Google collects are not important for me.</p><p>Due to this reason, I felt it wasn’t an acceptable trade-off to load the 19 KB
tracking script just to view basic website statistics. When decompressed, the
analytics script is about 46 KB which is just extra work for the browser to parse
and execute and for not a lot of gain in the context of my needs.</p><p>Another major issue is privacy. Google Analytics is free to use (for up to 10
million hits per month), but it’s only because the company recoups the cost of
running the service by using the aggregated data to track users for the purpose
of showing personalised ads.</p><p>As a result, the analytics script is often blocked by ad blockers and other anti
tracking extensions including those built into browsers such as Firefox, Brave,
and Vivaldi meaning that the reported statistics aren’t all that accurate
especially for sites with tech-savvy audiences like mine.</p><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/2020-07-11_15-29_4uwx2G2QGhq.jpg" alt="Firefox blocks Google Analytics"><figcaption><p>Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection blocks Google Analytics</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="evaluating-alternatives">Evaluating alternatives</h2><p>Quite a few Google Analytics alternatives have emerged recently with many
beginning to recognise that Google has way too much influence on the web and also
because of the usability issues discussed above.</p><p>My main criteria for a replacement was that it should be privacy-respecting,
lightweight and easy to use with a good balance of features. I found some
discussions on Hacker News on alternatives to Google Analytics and proceeded to
check out some of the suggestions.</p><p><a href="https://goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> was the first option I looked into. It
ticks most of the boxes and is fully open-source, easy to self-host and has a
sane pricing model but I was not in love with the <a href="https://stats.arp242.net/">user
interface</a> of the metrics dashboard. Another option
was <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>, but it’s proprietary and
too expensive for me at $19/month for ~100k views monthly.</p><p>Eventually, it came down to a choice between <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>
and <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>. They both have a similar feature set, a
good user interface to view my stats, and lightweight tracking scripts. I
decided to go with Plausible in the end.</p><p>It mostly came down to pricing (Plausible starts at $12/month for ~100k views
with a 33% discount if billed annually), and the fact that the
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">codebase</a> is fully open source and
supports
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/HOSTING.md">self-hosting</a>
without restrictions. On the other hand, Fathom starts at $14/month for the same
amount of views and the V2 of the service is no longer open source. They have a
<a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Lite version</a> on GitHub, but it’s clear
from the Readme file that they don’t want anyone to use it.</p><h2 id="switching-to-plausible">Switching to Plausible</h2><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/47xns5_KMt4Autrod_.jpg" alt="Switching from Google Analytics to Plausible"></figure><p>I decided to take advantage of Plausible’s generous 30-day trial to try out the
service and get a feel for how it works. Their tracking script is one of the
lightest out there coming in at around 834 bytes (1.3 KB uncompressed) which is
more than 20 times lighter than <abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr>'s
tracking script.</p><p>After adding the script to my site, the analytics began to show up almost
immediately. The <a href="https://plausible.io/plausible.io">dashboard</a> interface is
quite polished and supports all of the basic metrics such as page views and
unique visitors, browser and operating system statistics, device screen sizes,
locations, and referrer information.</p><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/2020-07-11_15-21_Mbda6pDzVby.jpg" alt="Plausible user interface"><figcaption><p>Plausible’s dashboard interface is visually polished and easy to use</p></figcaption></figure><p>It also supports event tracking, weekly or monthly email reports, and the
ability to proxy the tracking script through a custom domain which can be quite
handy because some browsers and extensions block all analytics services
including privacy-friendly ones.</p><p>I decided to run Plausible side by side with Google Analytics for a few days
just to see how the reported stats compare. Unsurprisingly, Plausible’s
reporting for page views was consistently about 30-40% higher presumably because
<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> is blocked by some clients. <abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> is gone for good now though.</p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>The experience of switching away from Google Analytics to Plausible was
painless and I’m really happy with how it turned out so far. I think both
Plausible and Goat Counter are excellent choices for anyone looking for a
privacy friendly alternative to Google Analytics. The former just has a bit more
visual polish while the latter is significantly easier to self-host but you
really can’t go wrong with either.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><section><li><a href="https://freshman.tech/tags/privacy">#privacy</a></li><li><a href="https://freshman.tech/tags/analytics">#analytics</a></li></section></article></div></section></div></div></div>]]>

The results blew me away. At the average breakfast buffet, the first item was taken by 75% of the diners (even when the order of the items was reversed).

It's never been easier to passively consume the opinions of others. It's also never been more dangerous. </p><p id="viewer-e6oeo"><span><strong>UNTHINKABLE THOUGHTS</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-6ftev"><span>Passive consumption acts as a blindfold, making us blissfully unaware of things which are right in front of our eyes. </span></p><p id="viewer-26bb4"><span>In every period of history, people believed things that were ridiculous. People used to believe that evil spirits hid in the leaves of Brussel sprouts. They’d cut a cross in each sprout before tossing it in the pan - to drive out the evil spirits. </span></p><p id="viewer-5qc47"><span>Hindsight makes it easy to see that these beliefs were ridiculous, but at the time you’d be frowned upon for believing anything otherwise. It’s naïve of us to think that our time is different. It’s unlikely that ours is the first period to have everything figured out, or the first period without any ridiculous beliefs. </span></p><p id="viewer-dhmes"><span>If everything you believe is something you're told to believe, is it a coincidence? Probably not. </span></p><p id="viewer-8pp5b"><span>And if you believe everything you're told to now, how can you be sure you wouldn't have believed everything you were told to if you grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, or in Germany in the 1930s?</span></p><p id="viewer-5pjtu"><span>We believe things today that people in the future will find ridiculous. The way to avoid these beliefs is by learning to think for yourself, and having the courage to stand by your thoughts.  </span></p><p id="viewer-6e0tg"><span>The aim is not to oppose the crowd, but to avoid believing something simply because the crowd tells you to. </span></p><p id="viewer-tt6g"><span><strong>THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENT THINKING</strong> </span></p><p id="viewer-a8b9b"><span>Your mind is like a sponge, it absorbs what it’s exposed to. Whether you put a sponge in water or in Coca-Cola, it’ll absorb it. Your mind absorbs the information you feed it, whether it’s good or bad. </span></p><p id="viewer-10dj"><span>Everything you do - the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/why-you-should-forget-your-passion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>career</u></span></a><span> you pursue, the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/the-biggest-decision-you-ll-ever-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>partner</u></span></a><span> you pick, the company you build - starts with a thought. That's why improving the way you think, improves the way you do everything. It’s difficult to think well when the sponge in your head is only exposed to the information at the front of the buffet.  </span></p><p id="viewer-d7f2p"><span>My company prioritises independent thinking. Regardless of what you’re doing, you're encouraged to think creatively and independently. That ethos, and the creativity that results from it, is the reason a small South African company is being invited to work with places like Harvard and MIT. It’s the reason we’re making waves in education - an industry that hasn't seen much progress in over a century.</span>

</p><p id="viewer-8svl6"><span>The world needs people who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for a country, for a company, and for those around them. People with a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision. </span>

</p><p id="viewer-f91mr"><span>But thinking for yourself is difficult. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Copernicus</u></span></a><span> realised the sun didn't go around the earth when traditional wisdom, everyone around him, and even the evidence of his senses said that it did. The idea was such a stretch that even he had a hard time believing it. He was forced into believing it because it was the only way the numbers made sense. </span></p><p id="viewer-7vfqr"><span>Everyone tried to talk him out of his idea. It happened in the 1400s, and it happens today. Society encourages conformity, and you’re ridiculed for having ideas that don’t fit into the box that society operates in. It’s important to reject the urge to conform, because what society wants for you is not always what’s good for you. </span></p><p id="viewer-fggmj"><span>The world is desperate for people who think creatively, independently and flexibly. They’re the creators, inventors and innovators. The people that drive progress and make the world a better place. The people that steer us in the right direction as the world changes faster and faster each day. </span></p><p id="viewer-6k5gg"><span><strong>DEFENDING AGAINST A BLAZING FIRE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-20kp1"><span>During a scorching heatwave, when crops catch fire, a circle is drawn around the blaze and the crops in that circle are deliberately set alight before the flames can reach it. Once the fire reaches the circle it stops, as there is nothing there left to burn. They use fire to kill fire. </span></p><p id="viewer-288jm"><span>Our minds - when fed the first piece of information you come across - are like crops without a ring of protection. They’re vulnerable and waiting to be destroyed. By being deliberate about what we consume and what we believe, we develop a ring of protection. </span></p><p id="viewer-5qbae"><span>In the centre of that ring is a mind that can go anywhere. A mind in the habit of going where society tells it not to, and thinking thoughts which are unthinkable. A mind capable of thinking creatively, independently and flexibly. </span></p><p id="viewer-7vlbi"><span><strong>BUILDING THE FUTURE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-dqbba"><span>We all have gifts. Whether you’re a painter, an engineer or a baker, it’s your responsibility to share your gifts with the world. That’s how the world gets better. That’s how the future gets built. </span></p><p id="viewer-89fit"><span>At the end of the day, the question is simply how will you use your gifts? Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure? </span></p><p id="viewer-5loul"><span>I choose the latter. I believe most people will too. We all want to </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/why-i-abandoned-22-percent-of-my-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>reach our potential</u></span></a><span>. We all want to improve the world around us and feel a sense of pride in what we've done. Nobody wants to reach their </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/prune-your-bullshit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>death bed</u></span></a><span> feeling like they could have done more. </span></p><p id="viewer-6lrs1"><span>When everything we do is determined by how we think, our minds are worth protecting. Are you protecting yours?</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<h2>Alan J. Perlis</h2>
<h3>Yale University</h3>
<i>This text has been published in SIGPLAN Notices Vol. 17, No. 9,
September 1982, pages 7 - 13.  I'm offering it here online until ACM stops me.
</i>
<p>
The phenomena surrounding computers are diverse and yield a
surprisingly rich base for launching metaphors at individual and group
activities. Conversely, classical human endeavors provide an
inexhaustible source of metaphor for those of us who are in labor
within computation.  Such relationships between society and device are
not new, but the incredible growth of the computer's influence (both
real and implied) lends this symbiotic dependency a vitality like a
gangly youth growing out of his clothes within an endless puberty.

</p><p> The epigrams that follow attempt to capture some of the dimensions
of this traffic in imagery that sharpens, focuses, clarifies, enlarges
and beclouds our view of this most remarkable of all mans' artifacts,
the computer.
</p><ol>
<li> One man's constant is another man's variable.

</li><li> Functions delay binding: data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the 
programming process.

</li><li> Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons.

</li><li> Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.

</li><li> If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.

</li><li> Symmetry is a complexity reducing concept (co-routines include sub-routines); seek it everywhere.

</li><li> It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

</li><li> A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

</li><li> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data 
structures.

</li><li> Get into a rut early: Do the same processes the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference (!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list - not the size of his vocabulary.

</li><li> If  you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some. 

</li><li> Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.

</li><li> If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put in micro-code and then they 
certainly  won't be the same.

</li><li> In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.

</li><li> Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.

</li><li> Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written and another for which it wasn't.

</li><li> If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.

</li><li> A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth writing.

</li><li> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.

</li><li> Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information 
implies a need to check communication.

</li><li> Optimization hinders evolution.

</li><li> A good system can't have a weak command language.

</li><li> To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.

</li><li> Perhaps if  we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them.

</li><li> One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow 
or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.

</li><li> There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in all known languages 
can only be said poorly.

</li><li> Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.

</li><li> Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some 
cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that 
would take as long?

</li><li> For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, 
not just an additional node.

</li><li> In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general - and often we know 
it too quickly.

</li><li> Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

</li><li> Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their logic but by the completeness of 
their case analysis. 

</li><li> The 11th commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.

</li><li> The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. 
It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.

</li><li> Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is 
with the great programmers.

</li><li> The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely 
demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.

</li><li> The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory 
external emulator. The standardization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen. 

</li><li> Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.

</li><li> Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any 
sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.

</li><li> There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

</li><li> Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.

</li><li> You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of  FORTRAN.

</li><li> In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.

</li><li> Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the fetch-execute-cycle.

</li><li> The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our 
analytic ones.

</li><li> Like punning, programming is a play on words.

</li><li> As Will Rogers would have said, "There is no such thing as a free variable."

</li><li> The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's 
the best book on anything for the layman.

</li><li> Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use 
squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon 
bra and fig-leaf.

</li><li> When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before - except our finger-tips will 
have been singed.

</li><li> Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.

</li><li> Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub-systems and so on ad infinitum - which is 
why we're always starting over.

</li><li> So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.

</li><li> Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.

</li><li> A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

</li><li> Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is 
arbitrarily changeable.

</li><li> It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

</li><li> Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

</li><li> In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.

</li><li> Dana Scott is the Church of the Lattice-Way Saints.

</li><li> In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.

</li><li> In computing, invariants are ephemeral.

</li><li> When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.

</li><li> Often it is means that justify ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when 
goal structures crumble.

</li><li> Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our 
understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

</li><li> Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.

</li><li> Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" 
and "program".

</li><li> If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. 
For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the 
one without the other?

</li><li> In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 
5 year period will begin.

</li><li> Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that 
doesn't require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.

</li><li> Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it 
depends on its benefits.

</li><li> An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.

</li><li> It is not a language's weaknesses but its strengths that control the gradient of its change:
Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac.

</li><li> It is possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole 
point is to always see it as soap bubble?

</li><li> Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality 
soothes our nerves.

</li><li> It is the user who should parameterize procedures, not their creators.

</li><li> The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like a game of musical chairs: 
The frantic search for balance always leaves one of the three standing ill at ease.

</li><li> If  your computer speaks English it was probably made in Japan.

</li><li> A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.

</li><li> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.

</li><li> In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".

</li><li> We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem!

</li><li> What is the difference between a Turing machine and the modern computer? It's the same as that
 between Hillary's ascent of Everest and the establishment of a Hilton hotel on its peak.

</li><li> Motto for a research laboratory: What we work on today, others will first think of tomorrow.

</li><li> Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their money on.

Rust has gained a lot of adoption in the past few years and developers are loving it. Although there are numerous other systems programming languages, Rust is one of the very few alternatives to C/C++ that can hold its own when it comes to performance.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><figure id="attachment_622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622"><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg" alt="Rust programming language" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg 1024w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-300x112.jpg 300w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-768x286.jpg 768w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust.jpg 1337w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622"><a href="https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/programmieren-in-rust/blob/master/slides/20-Rust-Community-Open-Source.pdf">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Rust is the language of our choice at Polymath for our upcoming Blockchain, Polymesh. In this post, I’ll be sharing some of my favorite Rust tricks and some tips for the new developers.</p><h3>Enum size is bounded by the largest&nbsp;member</h3><p>Enums are sized to be able to hold their largest variant. Therefore, it’s recommended to have similar sized variants within enums to avoid having a nonoptimal memory layout. You can consider boxing the larger variants if required. Consider this example:</p><pre>enum Foo{<br>    A(u64),<br>    B([u64; 1000]),<br>}<p>enum FooBoxing {<br>    A(u64),<br>    B(Box&lt;[u64;1000]&gt;)<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::A(0); // Its size is 8008 bytes.<br>    let y = FooBoxing::A(0); // Its size is just 16 bytes.<br>    println!("Foo size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;x));<br>    println!("FooBoxing size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;y));<br>}</p></pre><p>In the above example, variant A of enum Foo is much smaller in size than variant B but the memory layout used for both variants will be the same and hence when variant A is used, it will have nonoptimal performance.</p><h3>Avoid unnecessary clones</h3><p>Calling&nbsp;<code>.clone()</code> on a variable creates a copy of their data and it takes resources to create a copy. Therefore, clones have a negative performance effect in most cases and should be avoided. Often times, you will be able to pass references of the same variables to different functions rather than needing to clone them. For example:</p><pre>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x.clone()); //This clone is not needed<br>}<p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x); // This will work fine because you do not need<br>             // to use x after this call<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    // If you are able to edit func, it's likely that <br>    // you will be able to modify it to use references. <br>    // You wont need to use any clones then.<br>    func(&amp;x);<br>    func(&amp;x); <br>}</p></pre><h3>Modularizing tests</h3><p>If you structure your tests like</p><pre>tests/   <br>    foo.rs   <br>    bar.rs </pre><p>Then each one of those tests gets compiled as a separate binary, and that takes more compilation time and space. You can instead add your test files as modules to a single test so that only a single binary is generated. Your new tests structure will look something like:</p><pre>tests/<br>   all/<br>     mod.rs // mod foo; mod bar;<br>     foo.rs<br>     bar.rs<br>   mod.rs // mod all;</pre><p>I was able to cut our CI test time in Polymesh from 26 minutes to 8 minutes using this trick. It has the disadvantage that you can not change one test file and compile just that file. It will always compile the full binary even if you have changed just one test file. For us, compiling individual files was only ~10 seconds faster than compiling the full binary and hence we decided to go with this approach.</p><h3>The dbg!&nbsp;macro</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html">dbg macro</a> can be used to print the value as well as the source code of an express to stderr. Example usage:</p><pre>let a = 2;<br>let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;</pre><p>The above code will print:</p><pre>[src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</pre><h3>Using _ to make large numbers&nbsp;legible</h3><p>In Rust, you can use <code>_</code> between numbers to make them easier to understand.</p><pre>let answer = 42000000; // ugly<br>let answer = 42_000_000; // beautiful</pre><h3>The standard swap&nbsp;function</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html">swap function</a> allows you to directly swap two variables without needing to create a temporary variable.</p><pre>use std::mem;<p>let mut x = 5;<br>let mut y = 42;</p><p>mem::swap(&amp;mut x, &amp;mut y);</p><p>assert_eq!(42, x);<br>assert_eq!(5, y);</p></pre><h3>? converts between error&nbsp;types</h3><p>As you probably already know,&nbsp;<code>?</code> can be imagined as <code>unwrap</code> that returns the error instead of panicking. Instead of directly returning the error,&nbsp;<code>?</code> actually returns <code>Err(From::from(err))</code>. That means the error is automatically converted to the proper type if it is convertible.</p><h3>Same name macro, function, and&nbsp;type</h3><p>It is possible to declare a macro, a function and a type like an Enum with the same name and then import all three of them elsewhere with a single import statement.</p><h3>sccache</h3><p>sccache can cache cargo build artifacts so that they can be reused across workspaces. This means that if you have multiple Rust projects and they use an identical dependency, sccache will allow you to compile that dependency once and then reuse across the projects. It will save you compilation time and disk space. Rust target dirs are already so big, there’s no reason to store redundant binaries there.</p><p><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png" alt="rust target directory is very heavy" width="720" height="538" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png 720w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p><p>You can install <code>sccache</code> with Cargo: <code>cargo install sccache</code>. To enable <code>sccache</code>, you need to add <code>RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your build environment. One way to do that is to add <code>export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your&nbsp;<code>.bashrc</code>.</p><h3>Clippy and&nbsp;rustfmt</h3><p>They are two of my favorite Rust tools and if you don’t already use them, give them a try. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> can catch a variety of lints in your code and helps you write idiomatic code. To install Clippy, run <code>rustup component add clippy</code> and to run Clippy in your workspace, execute <code>cargo clippy</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>rustfmt, as the name suggests, is a tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. To install rustfmt, run <code>rustup component add rustfmt</code> and to run rustfmt in your workspace, execute <code>cargo fmt</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>I’d also like to give a shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>. It is an experimental modular compiler frontend for the Rust language. It works better than any other Rust compiler frontend for me. I highly recommend everyone to try it out.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Rust has a lot to offer and you can learn something new about Rust every day. I hope you learned something new from this post. If you want to add something or need help, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other mediums.</p><h3>Happy Hacking!</h3></div></div></article></div>]]>

July 11, 2020 | https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/5-features-that-c-has-that-f-doesnt-have/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/5-features-that-c-has-that-f-doesnt-have/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>In <a href="https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/will-csharp-replace-fsharp/">my previous post</a> in this series I discussed at a high level why C# will not render F# obsolete even as it gains more features. I also briefly discussed how a more limited and more focused feature-set can often be beneficial, although I didn't give any real examples of where this applies. So, I thought it would be useful to highlight features that C# has that F# <em>doesn't</em> have, and explain what the "cost" of them are - as well as what benefits you gain by <em>not</em> having them.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll highlight five features relating to some core fundamentals of C# and F# - mutability, statements and expressions; in the next post in this series I'll cover five other miscellaneous (but equally important!) C# features that are quite different in F#.</p>
<p>It's my hope that by looking at these, it helps you to realise that a strength of a language can't simply be measured by the number of features and there's always a trade-off to be had. Most of these design decisions are deeply baked into both C# and F# and it would be quite difficult to change or replace most of them today.</p>
<h2>1. Mutation</h2>
<p>By default, every value in F# is immutable. After you create a value - be that a simple primitive such an an <code>int</code> or a <code>Customer</code> record, you can't change them. For a record, this applies to all the fields, all the way down the chain. For developers used to working with imperative, mutable structures, it seems impossible to be usable but trust me - you definitely <em>can</em> write entire applications without <em>any</em> mutable values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <em>can</em> create mutable <em>variables</em> in F#, but it requires adding an extra <code>mutable</code> keyword whenever you define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>type Person = { Name : string; Age : int }
let p = { Name = "Sara"; Age = 28 }
p.Name &lt;- "Sarah" // error: This field is not mutable</code></pre>
<p>What are the benefits of this? The usual one that people talk about is parallelisation, which is true (you can safely share immutable data across threads, since no-one can modify the value), but there are others.</p>
<p>Firstly, trust: you can give any part of your code an immutable value and not have to worry about someone else modifying it. Once set, a value can <em>never</em> change!</p>
<p>And secondly, this decision has the unusual effect of changing how F# deals with accessibility: In F#, all functions, types and fields are <em>public</em> by default! Contrast this with C#, where you need to mark all public properties explicitly. Again, at first glance this seems unusual, but think about it: If you can't modify a value, where's the harm in anyone reading it? You may worry about encapsulation, but that's also something that tends not to be a concern in F#.</p>
<h2>2. Void</h2>
<p>F# doesn't have <code>void</code>. Instead, it has a value called <code>Unit</code> which contains no data but can be assigned, passed as an argument into a function and generally reasoned about. This fits into the F# mentality that <em>everything</em> is an expression and that <em>everything</em> has a result; you can't have a function that doesn't have an output.</p>
<p>Again, removing something gives you a benefit in its place: the unification of the type system. For example, there's no need any longer for both <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can simply use <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, since what you might consider a "void-returning" <code>Task</code> can now be treated as a <code>Task&lt;unit&gt;</code> - a <code>Task</code> that returns a value which <em>happens to contain no data</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, you can think about functions in F# even further than this: <em>every</em> function in F# has <em>one</em> input and <em>one</em> output! Multiple input arguments are either tupled (which is a single value) or are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/#calling-a-function">partially applied</a>. Think about that for a minute 🙂</p>
<h2>3. Early Return</h2>
<p>You can't return early from a function in F#. This is because everything in F# is an expression, so a function body can't simply arbitrarily return out of itself early. Take the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        return "You are over 100!" // early return

    if inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        return "Good"
    else
        return "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>In proper F#, you would write this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        "You are over 100!"
    elif inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        "Good"
    else
        "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>Two things stand out here: First, because there's no "early return", everything is unified to the same "level". Indeed, you would probably rewrite this using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching">pattern matching</a> which makes this even clearer. The second difference is that there is <em>no need</em> for the <code>return</code> keyword. Since everything in F# is an expression, and there's no early return, the final expression in any code block is by definition the result of that block. Simples!</p>
<h2>4. Implicit expressions</h2>
<p>Because F# is expression-oriented, and every function has a result, it makes no sense in calling a function (or any expression) and <em>not</em> assigning its result to a symbol. C# permits this, but F# will not allow you to simply discard the result of an expression:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
add 1 2 // warning: the result of this expression has type `int` and is implicitly ignored.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one exception to this rule: if an expression returns <code>unit</code>, F# realises that it is performing a side-effect of some kind e.g. writing to the console. In this case, the compiler will allow you to silently "ignore" the <code>unit</code> value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>one</em> situation where the C# compiler also will not silently throw away the result of a method call: if you're in an async / await block and forget to await an awaitable method call (i.e. something that returns a <code>Task</code>). But everywhere else, the compiler won't warn you. And thinking about it, that's not surprising because C# doesn't really have the same clear distinction between statements and expressions as F# has (indeed, I believe that there is even such a thing as a <em>statement expression</em> in C#!), and C# expressions are often limited to single lines of code.</p>
<p>But in F#, the way you write code is more about passing immutable values to functions that return <em>new values</em> - so the compiler takes a more active role in assisting you as you work to ensure you don't forget to deal with a value. If you really want to ignore the result of a function, F# has a built-in function called <code>ignore</code>, which simply takes in any value and returns <code>unit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
ignore(add 1 2) // no warning</code></pre>
<h2>5. Implicit Conversions</h2>
<p>Except in <em>extremely rare cases</em>, F# doesn't allow implicit conversions of one type to another. Even an <code>int</code> to a <code>float</code>, or an <code>int</code> to a <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code> is forbidden. Instead, you have to <em>explicitly</em> convert between them. This can initially feel clunky and event a little unsettling, but as it turns out, since F# has a lightweight syntax by nature, the extra "cost" of typing wrappers (such as <code>Nullable&lt;'T&gt;</code>) or conversions (<code>int</code> or <code>float</code>) is not nearly as painful as you might think.</p>
<p>In addition, doing so brings two benefits: firstly, there's an increase in predictability and simplicity - no magic conversions means less for you to think about in terms of what the compiler is doing. And secondly it makes type inference far more usable, because the compiler does not have to worry about the possibility of implicit conversions.</p>
<p>As a result F# can infer most anything for you - return types of functions, value types and function inputs. In the example below, the compiler can <em>guarantee</em> that <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> are integers, because we're adding <code>123</code> to them.</p>
<pre><code>let add first second = first + second + 123

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = 10 // Error: This expression was expected to have type Nullable&lt;int&gt; but here has type int

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Works.
let x = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Still works - basic type inference
let x = Nullable 10 // Still works - better type inference, no new keyword or parentheses</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Observe that there is no need to specify <code>&lt;int&gt;</code> for the final line of code - the compiler infers it for us. We also don't need the <code>new</code> keyword (this is largely optional in F#), or parentheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I hope you "got" the point of this post - reinforcing the idea that every language feature has a cost and that <em>not</em> having a specific feature in a language can open up doors to entirely different features that may outweigh the original feature that we've "lost".</p>

<p>Does 2020 begin a new decade? To answer this question we must consult the Pope, the Kaiser, the census, a hockey player, and ISO 8601.</p>

<p>A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has <em>a new decade</em> also arrived?</p>
<p>The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news">digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike</a>. We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/go-ahead-celebrate-the-new-decade-a-year-early-just-count-me-out-1.4127481">The Irish Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/when-does-the-new-decade-start-are-you-team-january-1-2020-or-team-january-1-2021-1624530-2019-12-02">India Today</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900">Farmer’s Almanac</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html">Timeanddate.com</a>, please somebody tell us!</em></p>
<p>Others resort to the nihilistic view that decades never begin or end, or rather, begin and end always and forever — they’re just ten-year spans of time without any defined order between them.<sup id="fnref:justspans"><a href="#fn:justspans">1</a></sup> This perspective was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/leafs-rielly-on-the-arrival-of-2020-i-dont-think-its-even-the-end-of-a-decade-174009256.html">introduced into the public mind</a> recently by Morgan Rielly, a player for the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s even the end of a decade. Every new year is the end of a decade.
2008 to 2018 [sic] is a decade. 2009 to 2019 [sic] is a decade. Every f—ing one is the end of
a decade. So all these people saying the decade’s come to an end — that happens
every new year.</p>
<p>So, it’s the end of the century, it’s the end of you-name-it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I’ll call the <em>Cardinals</em> and the <em>Ordinals</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Cardinals answer <em>yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations</em>. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer <em>no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning</em>. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">the dress</a>” of 2015 — is that still this decade? — have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? If only some authoritative source could lend its weight to either camp.</p>

<p>In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn’t called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian</a>” for nothing; <a href="https://typesandtimes.net/2020/01/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)">Pope Gregory XIII</a> commissioned it in the 16th century. Recent articles on the subject have consulted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f">meteorological associations</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/">philosophy professors</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">the United States Naval Observatory</a>.</p>
<p>I will put forward two potential authoritative sources on whether decades should be counted according to Cardinals or to Ordinals: ISO 8601 and decennial census legislation. And unfortunately, they lead us into different camps.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is the specification of (representations of) dates, times, and other calendar entities for use in computing. The International Organization for Standardization defines new versions every so often, the most recent one in 2019. It’s the closest thing we’ve got to a gold standard for dates and times in software. <em>What’s the right way to represent dates? Local times of day? Local times of day for some time zone? Time scales? Leap seconds?</em></p>
<p>ISO 8601 even defines a new standard calendar adapted from the Gregorian calendar.<sup id="fnref:iso8601calendar"><a href="#fn:iso8601calendar">2</a></sup> Just as Common Era was a secular substitution for Anno Domini, the ISO 8601 calendar supplants the Gregorian calendar. No more pesky Year 1 C.E. preceded by Year 1 B.C.E.; ISO 8601 has <em>Year Zero</em>,<sup id="fnref:yearzero"><a href="#fn:yearzero">3</a></sup> and negative years. That essentially makes the Ordinal thinking moot, as the first ISO 8601 decade includes the years 0 through 9, not 1 through 10.</p>
<p>Indeed, decades, as defined in ISO 8601, are the years <code>XXX0</code> through <code>XXX9</code>.<sup id="fnref:iso8601decade"><a href="#fn:iso8601decade">4</a></sup> For example, using <code>J</code> to denote decades, “the 2020s” are represented as <code>202J</code>; the “zero decade” is represented as <code>0J</code>; and “the negative zero decade,” meaning years -9 through 0, is represented as <code>-0J</code>. Somewhat strangely, the latter two decades both include year 0. As a consequence, ISO 8601 <em>really</em> rejects the Ordinals since decades no longer describe an ordered, mutually exclusive sequence of spans of ten years.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 is firmly in the camp of the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Not everyone finds ISO 8601 to be all that authoritative. But what about nation states? Although they don’t generally have reason to weigh in on the exact definitions of time, they do tend to institutionalize the decade in particular — as the period in which the government conducts a census. For those governments that conduct them decennially, surely they must spell out the precise formal interpretation of decades, right?</p>
<p>Recent legislation in the European Union does exactly that. In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9670557/KS-GQ-18-010-EN-N.pdf/c3df7fcb-f134-4398-94c8-4be0b7ec0494">standardization of population and housing census methodology</a> for member states, the EU specifies that member nations run a census “every decade” on a “reference date” of their choosing. “The first reference year shall be 2011. […] Reference years shall fall during the beginning of every decade.”<sup id="fnref:eucensus"><a href="#fn:eucensus">5</a></sup> In other words, the <code>1</code> years begin the decades and therefore the EU implicitly takes up the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>For the United States in particular, it’s even <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf">in our Constitution</a> to apportion Congressional representatives according to state populations counted “every subsequent Term of ten Years,” though the period of “decade” is not used. In <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution.htm">the New York state constitution</a>, however, not only is “decade” mentioned (also for apportionment of representatives), but its exact year bounds are explicitly clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… if, in any decade, counting from and including that which begins with the year
nineteen hundred thirty-one, such a readjustment or alteration is not made at the time
above prescribed, it shall be made at a subsequent session occurring not later than the
sixth year of such decade, meaning not later than nineteen hundred thirty-six,
nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred fifty-six, and so on …<sup id="fnref:ny"><a href="#fn:ny">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the mention of 1931 as the beginning of a decade and the mention of 1936 as the sixth year of the decade, the New York constitution clearly takes the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>Back to the whole US, the legal language around the decennial census itself does not seem to mention “decade” anywhere, not in any <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/legislation/">historic iteration of the Census Act</a> and, surprisingly, not in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13">US Code Title 13</a> that codifies the census bureaucracy. Our census occurs in the <code>0</code> years but there’s no qualification that these <em>begin</em> each decade. A 1908 American Statistical Association <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2275965">survey of census methodology across the Americas</a>, however, sheds some light on the counting in this field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most generally accepted dates for a decennial census are those that begin or end decades. The tenth year of the decade has been accepted in the United States and in several European countries, and in Brazil. England and most of her colonies accept the first year of the decade.<sup id="fnref:censusarticle"><a href="#fn:censusarticle">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US census occurs in the <code>0</code> years, referred to as the tenth (last) years of the decades, while the UK census occurs in the <code>1</code> years, referred to as the first years.</p>
<p>Altogether it seems that governments, at least those conducting decennial censuses in the anglophone world, take up the Ordinal position on decades.</p>

<p>With the geek and wonk authorities taking contradictory positions on the decade question, what about popular usage in the archives of major newspapers and other such publications? A scattershot of archival records, generally by searching for <code>"new decade"</code>, suggests that both counting styles have been used over the past century or so—and sometimes inconsistently in the same place. Such evidence includes:</p>

Itâ€™s a probÂ­lem that I have no way to verÂ­ify that the list I used was not cherry-picked for probÂ­lems solved by PhDs. The susÂ­piÂ­cious may want to look for a list of open mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal probÂ­lems pubÂ­lished in a definiÂ­tive form prior to 1995 and reÂ­peat this analÂ­yÂ­sis.</p><p>My model for why a PhD would be necÂ­esÂ­sary to achieve groundÂ­breakÂ­ing work is:</p><blockquote><p>ThÂ­ese deÂ­grees come with credÂ­iÂ­bilÂ­ity; acÂ­cess to exÂ­penÂ­sive equipÂ­ment, fundÂ­ing, and data; acÂ­cess to menÂ­tors and colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors. A smart perÂ­son who sets out to do groundÂ­breakÂ­ing STEM work will have a much lower chance of sucÂ­cess if they donâ€™t acÂ­quire an MD/â€‹PhD. MasÂ­sive, susÂ­tained soÂ­cial coÂ­orÂ­diÂ­naÂ­tion is ~necÂ­esÂ­sary to do groundÂ­breakÂ­ing reÂ­search, and the MD/â€‹PhD pipeline is a core feaÂ­ture of how we do that. Without that deÂ­gree, grant writÂ­ers wonâ€™t make grants. ColÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors wonâ€™t want to inÂ­vest in the reÂ­laÂ­tionÂ­ship. It will be exÂ­tremely difficult to conÂ­vince anyÂ­body to let someÂ­one withÂ­out a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree run a reÂ­search proÂ­gram.</p></blockquote><p>AuthorÂ­iÂ­taÂ­tiveÂ­ness of the proof, acÂ­cess to exÂ­penÂ­sive equipÂ­ment, and acÂ­cess to data donâ€™t seem to be very much at play in mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies.</p><p>PerÂ­haps the reaÂ­son these mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans enÂ­rolÂ­led in their PhD is that the acaÂ­demic enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment is both conÂ­venÂ­tional and atÂ­tracÂ­tive for geÂ­nius mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans, even though itâ€™s not acÂ­tuÂ­ally necÂ­esÂ­sary for them to do their work. My guess is that fundÂ­ing, the sense of seÂ­cuÂ­rity that comes with earnÂ­ing creÂ­denÂ­tials alÂ­lows risk-takÂ­ing, and acÂ­cess to long-term colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors and menÂ­tors also play an imÂ­porÂ­tant role.</p><p>37 of the disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies (46%) are credÂ­ited to a sinÂ­gle mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cian, givÂ­ing some perÂ­specÂ­tive on the exÂ­tent to which acÂ­cess to colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors is imÂ­porÂ­tant.</p><p>How did the two inÂ­venÂ­tors of Boyleâ€™s <i>desiderÂ­ata </i>who didnâ€™t hold a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree manÂ­age to do their work withÂ­out a PhD? The fact that they both worked in the field of robotics seems releÂ­vant.</p><p>Maybe the story is someÂ­thing like this:</p><p>EarnÂ­ing a PhD is both atÂ­tracÂ­tive and helpful for peoÂ­ple doÂ­ing baÂ­sic reÂ­search in esÂ­tabÂ­lished fields.</p><p>A PhD is less imÂ­porÂ­tant for doÂ­ing groundÂ­breakÂ­ing apÂ­plied enÂ­gÂ­ineerÂ­ing and enÂ­trepreneurial work, esÂ­peÂ­cially in tech.</p><p>Itâ€™s hard to overÂ­state the exÂ­tent to which busiÂ­ness conÂ­tributes to acaÂ­demic work. How many mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal, biologÂ­iÂ­cal, and physÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies would never have been made, if it werenâ€™t for robotics (inÂ­vented by someÂ­one with no higher edÂ­uÂ­caÂ­tion) and cheap comÂ­pute (proÂ­vided by the busiÂ­ness secÂ­tor)? How much has ecoÂ­nomic growth exÂ­panded our soÂ­cietyâ€™s caÂ­pacÂ­ity to fund acaÂ­demic reÂ­search?</p><p><strong>ConÂ­cluÂ­sion:</strong></p><p>Letâ€™s think about the situÂ­aÂ­tion of a STEM stuÂ­dent with lots of poÂ­tenÂ­tial, but no money and few acÂ­comÂ­plishÂ­ments.</p><p>If they do a PhD, theyâ€™ll get enough money to live on, and some time and menÂ­torÂ­ship to try and prove their inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship abilÂ­ities. ComÂ­ing out of it, theyâ€™ll have a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree, which will give them the opÂ­tion of conÂ­tinÂ­uÂ­ing in academia if they like it, or leavÂ­ing for inÂ­dusÂ­try if they donâ€™t.</p><p>If they go straight into inÂ­dusÂ­try withÂ­out a PhD, they might earn more money early on. But theyâ€™ll also have to work their way up from near the botÂ­tom, unÂ­less they can join a small startup early on. They might get caught in the imÂ­moral maze of some giÂ­ganÂ­tic corÂ­poÂ­raÂ­tion. They wonâ€™t have the same leeÂ­way a PhD stuÂ­dent has to choose their own proÂ­ject. And they likely wonâ€™t have the same long-term earnÂ­ing poÂ­tenÂ­tial.</p><p>From that point of view, the PhD conÂ­cept itÂ­self doesnâ€™t seem like empty creÂ­denÂ­tialÂ­ism. InÂ­stead, itâ€™s a mechanism for siftÂ­ing through the many bright young peoÂ­ple our soÂ­ciety proÂ­duces, givÂ­ing a cerÂ­tain perÂ­centage of them a boost toÂ­ward inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship and a chance to take a crack at a baÂ­sic reÂ­search probÂ­lem. Itâ€™s also a form of diÂ­verÂ­sifiÂ­caÂ­tion, a soÂ­cietal hedge against an overly short-term, profit-oriÂ­ented, comÂ­mons-neÂ­glectÂ­ing capÂ­iÂ­talÂ­ist apÂ­proach to R&amp;D.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Monocypher has been audited by Cure53 in June 2020.</p><div>
  <p>After spending six days on the Monocypher scope during this June 2020
project, two members of the Cure53 team can confirm that the provided
C code held well to their scrutiny. Few findings with limited
severities evidence a good security premise of Monocypher. What is
more, the code is exceptionally clean and demonstrates a clear focus
on security features. It relates to typical targets around embedded
environments, for instance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.</p>

<p>The findings highlight some exceptions linked to undocumented behavior
(MON-01-001) and a minor lack of rigor in test vectors
(MON-01-004). Beyond these, no serious issues were found in the
Monocypher code itself. However, some issues were spotted in the
cryptographic library design (see MON-01-005 and MON-01-002). Finally,
the Monokex protocol suite’s specification was found to be lacking
critical details on the behavior of its Message Authentication Codes
(MON-01-006). In the same realm, Cure53 also points out the necessity
to justify its relatively bareboned key derivation mechanism (MON-01-
003).</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the Monocypher code is well-written and supported
by clean, documented code and a suitable amount of test vectors, the
high-level design of the Monocypher’s developer-exposed API could use
more refinement (MON-01-005), as could the specification of the
Monokex suite of protocols (MON-01-006, MON-01-003).  Since no issues
of <em>High-</em> or <em>Critical-</em>severity could be spotted in the timeframe
available for this audit, Cure53 concludes this 2020 assessment on a
positive note.</p>

<p>Cure53 would like to thank Loup Vaillant-David who maintains
Monocypher for his excellent project coordination, support and
assistance, both before and during this assignment. Special gratitude
needs to be extended to Open Technology Fund Washington for sponsoring
this project.</p>
</div><p>I personally would like to thank Cure53 for their care and
professionalism.  Working with them was a pleasure.  Also big thanks to
the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">Open Technology Fund</a> for financing the
audit.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<h3>Introduction / Warning</h3>
<p>Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.</p>
<p>To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Summary Statistic</h3>
<p>To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers,  \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?</p>
<p>To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\);  and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.</p>
<h3>Defining a Discrepancy</h3>
<p>We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>How should we think about these three possible definitions?</p>
<p>The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called <b>zero-one loss</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:</p>
<center><br>
<img src="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png" alt="Discrepancy" title="discrepancy.png" width="800" height="466"><br>
</center>
<p>The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an <b>absolute deviation</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.</p>
<p>The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a <b>squared error</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.</p>
<p>When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).</p>
<h3>Aggregating Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).</p>
<p>In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:<br>
$$<br>
E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.<br>
$$</p>
<p>When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.</p>
<h3>Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies</h3>
<p>For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,<br>
$$<br>
s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$<br>
What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the <b>modes</b> of the \(x_i\).</p>
<p>In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):<br>
$$<br>
s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$<br>
Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the <b>median</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,<br>
$$<br>
s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,<br>
$$<br>
we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the <b>mean</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.</li>
<li>The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.</li>
<li>The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In equations,</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2018-08-24T22:09:09+1000">Fri, Aug 24, 2018</time></p><p><strong>update 31/08/2018</strong> - <em>moved “Libraries” section into a <a href="https://pl-rants.net/posts/libraries-vs/">separate post</a></em></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I read the paper <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/HaskellVsAda-NSWC.pdf">Haskell vs. Ada vs. C++ vs. AWK
vs. …</a>
which left me under impression that Haskell might be a great choice for
prototyping. Since then I did a few toy projects in Haskell, read <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229">Programming in
Haskell</a>
(which I found absolutely marvelous) but it was hard to come across a real-world
project where I could verify the claim.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I finally got the chance. The team I am a part of, apart from
writing totally awesome things in Elixir/Erlang in between times maintains
tremendous amount of legacy tools written in Perl with some bits of Python. One of
the tools is responsible for daily querying a bunch of <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdtool.en.html">RRD
files</a> using Perl, enriching
the data with some metadata using Python and dumping it all into a single <code>.csv</code>
file with all the metrics collected on the previous day. And when I say “a bunch”
that means almost a million in some cases. No one really looked at the tool for
years until the number of files to process has increased 4x times up to 800000
overnight. The tool could not keep up effectively making the daily reports
unusable. A temporary workaround was to run the tool on a beefy 24-core (with
only one core actually utilised) 2x CPU 128GB RAM HP Gen9 blade which was able
run the thing in 9 hours.</p>

<p>It just so happened that when the problem manifested itself I was chatting with
my boss about how awesome Haskell was and how OCaml was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack">the implementation
language of choice</a> for
some modern programming languages and how most software developers unreasonably
turn a blind eye to their great merits. And the boss - otherwise being
absolutely rational and pragmatic person - said that my wet dream might have
come true and I was to rewrite that tool in Haskell. While I was making some
finishing touches to the project I was on at the moment, eagerly awaiting for
the <strong>Haskell Rewrite Project</strong> to start, the other team member found… let’s
say an anti-pattern in Python part of the tool reducing 8 hours of Python
crunching to 20 minutes thus bringing the total run time of the tool down to 1
hour and 20 minutes. That eliminated the true to life business justification of
the rewrite. However, my boss - being <em>one of the most awesome bosses around</em> -
allowed me to start the project and prototype the tool in Haskell under
condition that I also were to write a prototype in Go and had it all done within
a week. After that I would have to present the results of the experiment to the
team. I love challenges and I wanted some hands-on experience with Go (which I
knew nothing about at that moment) so I happily accepted those conditions.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>In the nutshell the problem can be described as following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>parse command line arguments to gather parameters about DB connection, in-out
folders/files and something called device groups</p></li>

<li><p>query the required set of devices and relevant metadata from the MySQL database</p></li>

<li><p>based on the device set deduce the list of RRD files</p></li>

<li><p>for each file in the file set query data points for the 12:00AM - 11:55PM interval
of the previous day</p></li>

<li><p>dump every data point using human-readable metric name, device name,
etc. as a row to the specified <code>.csv</code> file</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tl-dr-or-comparison-table">TL;DR or comparison table</h2>

<p><strong>update 17/09/2018</strong> - added multiprocess OCaml and Go+goroutines results</p>

<p><strong>update 28/10/2018</strong> - added async OCaml results</p>

<p>Go version straight out of the box demonstrated the best performance. Haskell
version after some tinkering came second, and OCaml version while being slower
than the other two was the best in memory consumption.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Go routines or any other concurrency/parallelism techniques in
either version because I wanted a fair comparison with the Perl/Python version
and also wanted as simple solution as possible. Go and Haskell used parallel GC
though, so comparison was not completely fair.</p>

<p>Also it is worth noting that Go version used <code>librrd</code> wrapper and consequently
skipped parsing of <code>rrdtool</code> output altogether.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Run time</code> is how long it took to process those 800000 files.</li>
<li><code>Memory</code> is the maximum memory consumption for the file set.</li>
<li><code>LOC</code> is the number of lines of code including imports.</li>

<li><p><code>Size</code> is the executable file size (everything linked statically).</p></li>

<li><p><code>Build time</code> is how long it takes to rebuild the executable. All versions but
<code>OCaml + glob</code> have only one file. The build time does not take into account
building any extra dependencies.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Impl time</code> is how many hours (approximately) it took me to implement a version.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I used the latest stable version of compilers. That is Go 1.10.4, GHC 8.4.3,
OCaml 4.07.0. I also tried compiling with GHC 8.2 and OCaml 4.0.5 but results
were consistent across versions.</p>

<h2 id="go-version">Go version</h2>

<p>Go had to be the first one because I was not sure if I would be able to
complete it in time and wanted as much leeway as possible. I started with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A
Tour of Go</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">some other
tutorials</a> which consumed one weekend
of my time. I excluded that time from the table above because I already had some
experience with Haskell and OCaml and taking the time into account did not seem fair.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Go’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>I found tooling being very good, easy to use, fast. Most things just worked out
of the box. There is a single entry point - <code>go</code> command - which allows to
build/install/remove packages and executables.</p>

<p>What I liked the most (although it’s probably irrelevant for many) is that
setting up Emacs environment took me only 30-40 minutes. <code>go-mode</code>, <code>go-eldoc</code>,
<code>go-autocomplete</code>, <code>go-rename</code> required little to no extra tweaking delivering
a very pleasant, virtually bug-free development experience. I especially liked
<code>go-playground</code> which provided me with almost repl-like functionality.</p>

<p>Documentation for the language, the standard library, tools, third-party
packages is extremely good. It is approachable being beginner-friendly but
comprehensive at the same time.</p>

<p>To sum it up: excellent.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Go’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Go was easy to set up, easy to use. Abundance of documentation and ready-to-use
libraries written clearly and concisely helped a lot. Language-wise I had
experience not dissimilar to what I had with AWK as a code-gen tool for a bigger
C project - somewhat awkward but straightforward - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS
principle</a> at its fullest. I think
it is a good language that anyone can start hacking without having to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182">a
Category Theory
book</a>.</p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is not that bright I am afraid. There is no a standard
way (at time of this writing at least) to lock dependencies. It is not a problem
for small one-off projects, but I can’t image how people are able to
develop/maintain larger code bases without falling into <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/Survival">cabal
hell</a>. Not dissimilar to Haskell, NixOS
could be an answer to that problem.</p>

<p>Another observation, and it does stand out, especially after Haskell experience,
is that language-wise it feels like a “can I have a C (or AWK) but without this
and that annoyances please?“. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I’ve got
mixed feelings about it and will probably write a post or two to get
into more details.</p>

<h2 id="haskell-version">Haskell version</h2>

<p>To evaluate Haskell in that semi-production setting was the main goal of the
experiment. I knew enough of the language to start writing code straight away
but I wanted to measure how productive I would be (and how much faster the tool
would become). The only problem was that I had only two days left to answer the
question.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Haskell’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>Back In 2016 <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode"><code>haskell-mode</code></a> with
<code>interactive-haskell-mode</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode"><code>structured-haskell-mode</code></a>
for Emacs provided well-rounded development environment. I am not sure what has
changed since then but I could not glue it all together and spent at least three
hours trying the setup. I ended up using
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero"><code>intero-mode</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany"><code>brittany</code></a> for code formatting. It
worked reasonably well but determining a highlighted expression type, especially
if it involved polymorphic functions was highly unreliable. I had to use
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes">typed holes</a> all the time. Worst
of all was that repl within Emacs tend to produce some scary error messages -
“unfathomable operation” or something along the lines - every time I called
anything IO-related. I had to run the repl in the terminal to avoid that.</p>

<p>Documentation is scarce at best. Most libraries provide but a few pointers or
remarks for the authors themselves rather than a comprehensive documentations,
let alone “getting started” guides or tutorials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a> is your friend and works fine from
command line/Emacs. It has been invaluable and I wish all languages would
provide something like that. The problem, however, is those
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a> pages are hard to
navigate. “Synopsys” is useless when there are more than a handful of functions
(which is true in most cases) because it does not scroll, effectively displaying
only first 10-15 items. I ended up using <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> from
Emacs because it was the only sane way to navigate through e.g. 100+ functions in
ByteString library.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">stack</a> was OK. I think it
has become even better over the past two years. My only gripe is that it lacks
<code>search</code> command and something like <code>deps fetch/update/remove</code> to simplify
handling of dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Haskell’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Using Haskell was surprisingly hard. When searching for information scattered
through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell">Haskell Wiki</a>, StackOverflow posts
and multiple blogs I felt more like a detective or investigator rather than a
software engineer. Had I had something akin to <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> but up to date, the whole process
could have been smoother. Alas I had not and I struggled.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The impact on middleware of expanding APIs with Go's interface smuggling</h2>

	<p><small>July 10, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently, the Go blog had <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-compatibility">Keeping your Modules Compatible</a> which is about
doing exactly that as you add features and want to expand your
module's API. When the module's API involves interfaces, one of
the approaches they suggested is what I've called <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoInterfaceSmuggling">interface
smuggling</a> and what other people have
called <em>interface upgrades</em>. Let me quote the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you run into a case where you want to add a method to an existing
interface, you may be able to follow this strategy. Start by creating
a new interface with your new method, or identify an existing
interface with the new method. Next, identify the relevant functions
that need to support it, type check for the second interface, and add
code that uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quite popular approach, one used by many packages in Go's
standard library and third party packages. However, it has a dark
side, and that is its unfortunate effects on middleware.</p>

<p>The problem for middleware is best illustrated by the most common
sort of middleware, which is things that interpose in the chain of
HTTP handlers to modify the results. Much middleware wants to look
at or act on some aspect of the HTTP reply, for example <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoPrometheusMetricLabels">to gather
metrics based on the result code</a>, which
means that it must modify and proxy the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter"><code>http.ResponseWriter</code></a> passed to child
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>s. Over
time the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a> has
acquired a whole collection of smuggled interfaces on ResponseWriters,
such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier"><code>http.CloseNotifier</code></a> (which is deprecated),
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher"><code>http.Flusher</code></a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker"><code>http.Hijacker</code></a>, and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Pusher"><code>http.Pusher</code></a>. In the
future there will probably be more.</p>

<p>(In addition, the ResponseWriter may or may not support
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom"><code>io.ReaderFrom</code></a>.)</p>

<p>If you're a piece of middleware, the ResponseWriter you're passed
may support some, many, or all of these additional APIs. However,
Go provides you no good way to pass this support through your proxy
ResponseWriter that you're going to pass to children Handlers. The
Prometheus people try hard to do it anyway, and <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/prometheus/promhttp/delegator.go">the result is
rather messy</a>
and involves a combinatorial explosion of the possible combinations
of APIs. As the case of io.ReaderFrom shows, these additional APIs
don't even necessarily come from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a>. A smuggled
interface from anywhere may need to be supported.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that you just don't support these additional
APIs in your middleware, or you only support a few of them. The
problem with this is that the ResponseWriter and the client code
that people are trying to use your middleware with well have been
developed, tested, and normally used in an environment where these
expanded APIs are used, not cut off. As we all know, if you don't
test it it doesn't work. Your middleware may be the first code to
try to pass the next hop a ResponseWriter with a genuinely narrow
API, because such narrow APIs may mostly come from middleware. And
of course if there are any bugs in the result, people will blame
your middleware.</p>

<p>None of this is insurmountable. But beyond the problems and the
hassles, it means that expanding your API with interface smuggling
is decidedly not transparent if people use middleware with it. And
as a practical matter, some amount of the time your new API will
not be usable until middleware is expanded to cope with it (if it
ever is).</p>

<p>Another problem is that this expansion of middleware to cope with
your new API can't happen until your new API itself is pervasive.
Go currently provides no support for conditional building based on
the version of other packages or the state of their API, so middleware
can't include any use of your new API interfaces until it doesn't
have to build against versions of your package that predate them.</p>

<p>(People can work around this for HTTP middleware because they can
make files build only on specific minimum versions of Go. Your
package doesn't have this magical power; it's something available
only for new APIs in the Go standard library.)</p>

<p>Because nothing is new under the sun, this problem was noticed back
in 2014's <a href="https://avtok.com/2014/11/05/interface-upgrades.html">Interface Upgrades in Go</a>, which is
one of the earliest places to call this pattern an 'interface
upgrade'. The article notes the proxy problem and ends with a call
to use interface upgrades sparingly. This is good advice in my
opinion, but is very much at odds with the idea of routinely using
interface upgrades to expand your API.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the COVID crisis, the governor of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/As-Unemployment-Claims-Spike-New-Jersey-Seeks-COBOL-Coders.html">called for COBOL developers</a> to help the state fix its unemployment insurance systems. The systems were crashing under overwhelming demand, and the culprit seemed to be the decades-old code underpinning the application for benefits. Predictably, critics jumped all over the government for continuing to operate vital systems using a programming language invented more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>News flash: the C programming language is the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">most popular language</a> in the world and it’s nearly as old as COBOL. SQL is the backbone of database programming, and it was invented in the 1970s. The age of a technology is no indicator of its viability or appropriateness for solving mission-critical problems. The fact that something is old may just mean that it has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>As it turns out, New Jersey ultimately didn’t hire any COBOL developers because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/">the problem wasn’t really COBOL</a>, it was actually something more quotidian and less dramatic: the ability to process forms on the internet in a way that scales. The problem New Jersey and other governments have isn’t that they’re using old code or older programming languages. The problem is often that they’re using <strong>code that wasn’t designed to meet the needs of people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>The frustrated users of New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system shouldn’t necessarily blame the errors they encountered on COBOL. They ought to blame them on a system architecture that wasn’t built to handle increased demand, or on an interface that was copied directly from a PDF instead of being designed based on intensive testing with users. Blame them on systems that can’t talk to each other behind the scenes, so they keep asking people to re-enter their information. Blame them on a complex authentication process for tasks that can be done without requiring someone to create an account or sign in.</p>

<h2 id="getting-good-at-online-forms">Getting good at online forms</h2>

<p>Governments need to see themselves as digital services providers, which means investing in the product, user experience, and research skills necessary to understand the problems of people using their services, and the software engineering and operations skills that make the services reliable and available at the time of someone’s needs. Simply putting out a procurement for a new software project will not guarantee that it’s easy-to-use or able to stand up during a huge increase in demand, without requiring these specific capabilities from the delivery team.</p>

<p>To start, governments need to develop competency at putting forms on the internet and having them scale to meet demand, while integrating smoothly with backend systems and office processes. This skill is at the core of nearly all modern government digital services, yet many agencies continue to operate online forms that are the door to vital services but can’t compete with the user experience and reliability of common consumer apps.</p>

<p>Creating online forms that are easy for the public to fill out and easy for office staff to process is absolutely within reach for every government agency if they’re willing to follow the best practices of consumer technology in designing and operating these services.
At Ad Hoc, we start by bringing in product management and user research experts to work closely with agencies to investigate the main problem to solve and define the outcomes agencies are seeking. We take in all the constraints of government from privacy to security to accessibility, and balance those with the researched needs of real users, informing agency stakeholders of the tradeoffs and empowering them to make effective choices. We conduct usability research with people who come to government websites looking for services to find out where they get stuck, and what could be done to make the experience better.</p>

<p>Our research team also spends time with the civil servants who process incoming requests from the public to see where the bottlenecks are in their process and how we can ensure any new public-facing application integrates with their backend systems. That often means we have to integrate new applications with old systems and “old” code like the COBOL in New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system.</p>

<p>User research, both at the beginning of a project and throughout development, informs how our product managers set “north stars”, or shared visions of a future success, and outcome metrics with the government customer. As our engineers and designers create these new services, they’re always working towards outcomes for real people. We ask, how many people were able to enroll in a benefit? How often did the site go down and deny access to the application? We prioritize outcome-based metrics over how many features we shipped, or how many story points we completed, or whether we’re using the latest technology to get the job done.</p>

<h2 id="choose-whats-right-over-whats-old">Choose what’s right over what’s old</h2>

<p>Yes, agencies should evaluate whether their continued investment in COBOL and mainframes makes sense for them in terms of their unique constraints of available budget and technology resources, just as they should continuously examine any system, regardless of its technology stack or the age of particular components, for whether its delivering the outcomes they want within the constraints they have.</p>

<p>Agencies should also fix the errors of the past and invest in new and more efficient technologies. No civil servant should have to print out forms submitted online and re-enter the information into another system. But we must be precise about what needs updating and why, and not be dismissive of technologies merely because of their age.</p>

<p>The so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>” describes how nearly every computer on the planet is designed and operates. It dates back to the mid-1940s and is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged to this day. We would hardly blame New Jersey’s woes on von Neumann computers, just as we shouldn’t blame forms crashing on COBOL code just because it’s old.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>7th January 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest in my series of minimalist watches using 12 LEDs, arranged like a clock face, to show the time analogue-style. This one takes advantage of the fact that Microchip's new 1-series ATtiny microcontrollers incorporate a real-time clock, which can be run from an external crystal to keep accurate time while the main processor is put to sleep:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatimewatch.jpg" alt="MegaTimeWatch.jpg" width="500" height="432"></p>
<p><em>The Mega Tiny Time watch based on an ATtiny414; it's ten to two.</em></p>
<p>To show the time you press the button on the watch face, and it lights up LEDs to show the time like the hour and minute hands on a clock. The LEDs flash to distinguish the hours and minutes, and show intermediate times. The watch keeps time to within a few seconds a month, while giving a battery life of several years.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1MG3">Tiny Time 2 Watch</a>&nbsp;used Maxim Integrated's DS2417 RTC chip to keep time while the processor was put to sleep, to save power. Since I designed that, Microchip have released their 1-series ATtiny chips that incorporate a crystal-controlled real-time clock; this can keep time while the processor is asleep, avoiding the need for a separate RTC chip. Spence Konde calls these the "Mega Tiny" range; hence the name of this watch.</p>
<p>I based this watch on the 14-pin ATtiny414, which has 4K bytes of flash memory, and has an RTC peripheral that supports an external crystal. In this design there are a few I/O pins spare, so you could extend the watch with other features; see <a href="#further-suggestions">Further suggestions</a> below.</p>
<p>As with my earlier watch, to show the time you press the button on the watch face, and the time is then displayed for five seconds. It lights one LED to show the hour, and flashes one or two other LEDs to show the minutes to the nearest minute by altering the rate at which each of the LEDs flash. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchexamples.gif" alt="WatchExamples.gif" width="527" height="206"></p>
<p><em>Examples of how the Mega Tiny Time watch displays the time.</em></p>
<p>For consistency with analogue watches, the Tiny Time Watch displays times later than half past the hour by lighting the next hour number. If only one LED lights up you know that both hands are pointing to the same hour mark.</p>
<p>The total power consumption with no display is just 1µA, giving an estimated battery life of over 10 years from a single CR2016 battery! Obviously this is reduced if you check the time frequently.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit of the Tiny Time 2 watch, laid out like the circuit board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchtinymega.gif" alt="WatchTinyMega.gif" width="642" height="547"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the ATtiny414-based Mega Tiny Time watch.</em></p>
<p>The crystal is a standard&nbsp;32.768 kHz quartz watch crystal; I chose a MS1V-T1K micro crystal&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but I expect any&nbsp;32.768 kHz&nbsp;crystal would be suitable. A 3.2 X 1.5 mm SMD crystal would also fit across the pads on the PCB.</p>
<p>The LEDs are 0805 size, and for this version of the watch I chose white LEDs to contrast with the black circuit board. I got mine from Bright Components in the UK, who sell them for under £1 for ten&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. Any colour LED should be fine, but they should all be the same colour.</p>
<p>I arranged the LEDs to simplify the PCB layout which explains the rather haphazard order, but this is easily accommodated by an array in the software. The following table shows which LED lights up when you take one I/O line high and the other I/O line low:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watch3leds.gif" alt="Watch3LEDs.gif" width="243" height="167"></p>
<p>The button is a miniature SMD push button available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, available from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery is a 20mm coin cell. Given the low current consumption I decided to use the slimmer CR2016 cell, and found a suitable SMD battery holder on Mouser <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. Alternatively you could use a CR2032 battery, with an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a child could play with this watch please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, or glue in the coin cell, so the cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h4>â–º Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed the board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication.&nbsp;Here's the layout (from the OSH Park preview):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimewatchpcb.gif" alt="MegaTinyTimeWatchPCB.gif" width="441" height="250"></p>
<p>See the end of the article for links to download the board files or order a board.</p>
<p>I built the watch using SMD components, with all the components apart from the battery holder soldered to the front of the board. The ATtiny414 was SOIC, and I used 0805 resistors and LEDs, so they should be relatively easy to solder by hand:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimefront.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeFront.jpg" width="290" height="330"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimeback.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeBack.jpg" width="290" height="330"></p>
<p><em>The front and back of the completed Mega Tiny Time watch circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The LEDs should all be soldered with the same orientation, with the negative sides facing the centre of the board.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 250°C to solder the SMD components onto the front of the board, and then finally soldered the battery holder onto the back of the board using a conventional soldering iron. If you don't have a hot air gun you should be able to solder the SMD components with a bit of care using a fine-tipped soldering iron.</p>
<p>I found a suitable 12mm wide thread-through watch strap from a German supplier <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>This section explains the various sections of the Tiny Time Watch program.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Clock</h4>
<p>As in my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">New ATtiny Low Power</a>, the aim is to keep the processor asleep most of the time to minimise the watch's power consumption.</p>
<p>From the ATtiny414 datasheet I realised that there were two possible ways to use the 1-series ATtiny Real-Time Clock peripheral in this application. It could run as a Real-Time Counter, keeping a 16-bit count of the number of elapsed seconds in the RTC CNT Count register while the processor stays asleep. Alternatively it could run as a Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT), generating an interrupt to wake up the processor briefly every second and increment a variable to count the number of seconds.</p>
<p>In theory the CNT approach should give slightly lower power consumption, because the processor only needs to be woken up when you're displaying the time, but I couldn't get it to work; the CNT register didn't seem to get incremented when the processor was asleep. However, the PIT approach worked perfectly, and the difference in power consumption is probably minimal. If I get the CNT method working I'll post it as an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the RTC to use an external crystal is more complicated than you might expect, because the Clock Controller is protected from accidental change by Configuration Change Protection (CCP), so before each change you have to enable the action first. Fortunately there's an application note that explains how to do this, and my code is based on one of the examples in that note <sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The display</h4>
<p>The 12 LEDs are driven by the four I/O lines PA1, PA4, PPA5, and PA6. The array Pin[6][6] specifies how the LEDs are connected to the five I/O lines:</p>
<pre>int Pins[6][6] = {{ -1, -1, -1,  8,  6,  4 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  {  7, -1, -1, -1, 11,  9 },
                  {  0, -1, -1, 10, -1,  2 },
                  {  5, -1, -1,  3,  1, -1 }};</pre>
<p>The first row of the array specifies which LEDs have their cathodes connected to PA1: the LED at 8 o'clock has its anode connected to PA4, the LED at 6 o'clock has its anode connected to PA5, and the LED at 4 o'clock has its anode connected to PA6. The values in the array corresponding to PA2 and PA3 are set to -1, as these aren't connected to any LEDs; it was simpler to use a larger array than write code to compensate for this.</p>
<p>I used Timer/Counter TCB running at 250 Hz to multiplex the display. This is set up by the routine <strong>DisplaySetup()</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplaySetup () {
  // Set up Timer/Counter TCB to multiplex the display
  TCB0.CCMP = 19999;                                  // Divide 5MHz by 20000 = 250Hz
  TCB0.CTRLA = TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc | TCB_ENABLE_bm; // Enable timer, divide by 1
  TCB0.CTRLB = 0;                                     // Periodic Interrupt Mode
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}</pre>
<p>The interrupt service routine simply calls <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong>, decrements the global variable <strong>Timeout,</strong> and increments the global variable <strong>Offset</strong> used when initially setting the time:</p>
<pre>ISR(TCB0_INT_vect) {
  TCB0.INTFLAGS = TCB_CAPT_bm;                        // Clear the interrupt flag
  DisplayNextRow();
  Timeout--;
  Offset++;
}</pre>
<p>Two additional routines are used to turn the display on and off:</p>
<pre>void DisplayOn () {
  // Turn off all the pullups
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = 0;
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}

void DisplayOff () {
  TCB0.INTCTRL = 0;                                   // Disable interrupt
  PORTA.DIR = 0;                                      // All PORTA pins inputs
  // Turn on all the pullups for minimal power in sleep
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;                  // UPDI
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
}</pre>
<h4>Display multiplexing</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong> works as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextRow() {
  Cycle++;
  uint8_t row = Cycle &amp; 0x03;
  if (row &gt; 0) row = row + 2;                         // Skip PA2 and PA3
  uint8_t bits = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    if (Hours == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
    if (Fivemins == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
  }
  PORTA.DIR = 1&lt;&lt;(row+1) | bits;                      // Make outputs for lit LED
  PORTA.OUT = bits;                                   // Set outputs high
}
</pre>

<p>Up to two LEDs can be lit at once. The LED specified by the variable <strong>Hours</strong> is used to show the hours, and is displayed continuously. The LED specified by the variable&nbsp;<strong>Fivemins</strong>&nbsp;is used for the minutes.</p>
<p>The bottom two bits of the variable <strong>Cycle</strong> determine which row is being displayed. For a given row the array <strong>Pins[row][i]</strong> is checked to see if any of the LEDs in that row need to be displayed. If so, the appropriate bits are set in the variable <strong>bits</strong>. This is then written to the port.</p>
<p>To test the the LEDs you can run the following&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong> function instead of …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Sometimes you’re bored on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of data visualization on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of (or, better yet, eat) dumplings on a Friday night.</em> <em>And sometimes, you do all of the above.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dumplings">

<p>I am a fan of dumplings. Bread-type foods are awesome. Filled foods are awesome. Filled bread is awesome (if you’ve never had a Georgian <em>lobiani</em>, you’re missing out!). A dumpling, though not necessarily having to be filled, combines a lot of this. In <em>my</em> world, a dumpling is normally cooked in some liquid though – that is, boiled, simmered, steamed, or deep-fried, rather than, say, baked. We’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I work as a researcher in linguistics, and I’m interested in comparing different languages. How are they similar and how are they different? Sometimes, I use multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a way of comparing such similarities or differences. Anyway, on this particular Friday night (August 23rd, 2019), I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Laserhedvig/status/1164794499324772354">Twitter post</a> mentioning a “dumpling party” (omg, that in itself = love), at which one person had brought Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini"><em>arancini</em></a>, which received “mixed reception” by the other guests. So I started thinking, <em>what defines a “dumpling”, and can you group them based on various features</em>. Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender">Emily Bender et al.</a> had already established a definition of <em>dumpling</em> at their website promoting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/idop-idod/idod"><em>International Day of Dumplings</em></a> – I did not know of this as of this particular Friday night.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought <em>what if I just look up some dumplings on Wikipedia, and code some of the specific features for each one?</em> This could allow me to plot them in two-dimensional space using MDS methods. I was intrigued by the possible outcome, so I started reading through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wikipedia article “Dumpling”</a>…</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling">

<p>My method wasn’t very sophisticated. I started by scrolling through the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Dumpling</a>, and basically took each item that had its own article (I may have missed a few), transferred it to a spreadsheet, and started adding some columns for particular features. As I started getting more items, the number of features grew, and I have to be honest, they are far from perfect and just things that I thought of on the spot. A <em>much better</em> analysis could easily be done with a bit more sophistication, time, and systematicity. I mean, this was after all just a random Friday night and I was already past my bed time…</p>
<p>In the end, I collected data from 61 different dumplings. Note that when I say different, this categorization is not at all well-defined. I tried to exclude duplicates for which even the names themselves were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"><em>cognates</em></a>. Chinese <em>jiǎozi (餃子)</em> is related to Japanese <em>gyōza (ギョーザ)</em> and thus only the former was included. However, in the case of German <em>Knödel</em> and Czech <em>knedlík</em>, I decided to include both simply based on the fact that whereas the former was listed as potentially being served with a sweet filling, I did not observe this with the latter – NB: I promise this wasn’t a biased decision (see the <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a> section).</p>
<p>Beyond the dumplings sampled according to the above criteria, I also included a few items not traditionally seen as dumplings, because I wanted to see how they patterned with the dumplings proper. These items include <em>calzone</em>, <em>bitterballen</em>, and – of course – <em>arancini</em>. The resulting sample of 61 items can be seen below.</p>

<p>The features that I ended up settling on amounted to 15 different ones. Some are related but not mutually exclusive. The concern mainly content, form, and preparation. Some dumplings can be prepared in several ways (e.g., either <em>boiled</em> or <em>steamed</em>) and may be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>savory</em>; others seem to be more strict with regard to some of these features.</p>

<h3>Dumpling features</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flour</strong>: <em>Is flour (any type) used in the dough?</em></li>
<li><strong>Bread</strong>: <em>Are bread bits or breadcrumbs added?</em></li>
<li><strong>Battered</strong>: <em>Is the dough battered (or itself a batter) before prepared?</em></li>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>: <em>Is any starchy produce added to the dough (e.g., potatoes)</em></li>
<li><strong>Plain</strong>: <em>Does it occur without filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Filled</strong>: <em>Does it occur with filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Thick</strong>: <em>Is the doughy coating “thick” (yes, this is quite subjective)</em></li>
<li><strong>Boiled</strong>: <em>Can it be boiled?</em></li>
<li><strong>Steamed</strong>: <em>Can it be steamed?</em></li>
<li><strong>DeepFried</strong>: <em>Can it be deep-fried?</em></li>
<li><strong>Fried</strong>: <em>Can it be fried (e.g., in a pan or a grill)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Baked</strong>: <em>Can it be baked (e.g., in an oven)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Raw</strong>: <em>Can it be served basically as is?</em></li>
<li><strong>Sweet</strong>: <em>Is it sweet?</em></li>
<li><strong>Savory</strong>: <em>Is it savory?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each dumpling was assigned a binary value (0 or 1) per feature, resulting in the below table – again, not that this was not very serious work on a Friday night and I was tired; errors are to be expected (but feel free to re-work this yourself if you feel like it!).</p>
