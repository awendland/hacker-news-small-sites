<p>While listening to a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/12/02/bgp-with-andree-toonk/">podcast discussing BGP</a> I heard the fact that AWS owns more than $2B worth of IP addresses. I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a <a href="https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/">site</a> that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size. Now it was time to figure out the IP addresses owned by Amazon. I figured this would be difficult but lucky for us AWS actually <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">publishes</a> their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.</p>

<p>The work is simply to download the JSON and then convert the CIDR blocks to the number of IPs and add them all up. As of today, December 11, 2020 AWS self reports owning 109,847,486 IPV4 addresses - at a price of $20 this is almost $2.2B and at $30 it’s almost $3.3B. That’s wild.</p>

        <p>For over two decades, the JVM (and thus Java) has ruled supreme while other runtimes have come and gone. Ruby, Python, .Net, NodeJS, have all tried to take the throne. But the JVM offered something none could: a multi-threaded, JIT-compiled, high-performance, fully backward compatible runtime.</p><p>That the JVM hasn't kept up with the times, can be demonstrated with a simple example. Say you write a small command-line utility function in Java that has dependencies on a few jars. How does one package and distribute this utility? One could look at StackOverflow to see which plugin of your favorite build system is currently popular to create a Fat Jar. However, the official 'Java way' to package your code and its dependencies is still the good old .war file. A faster moving organization would have acknowledged how users like to ship their code. They would have extended the .jar file format (or introduced a new file format) to be able to package dependencies in a standardized manner. But no such thing on the horizon with Java.</p><p>Java is moving faster than ever now, one might say. It does get 2 minor releases a year now. (Though, does anyone really use the features of non-LTS Java versions?). Sure the module system in Java 9 allowed the JVM to shed some of its weight, but major additions to the JVM which would put it on par with competition still seem to be a long way away. Project Valhalla, which was supposed to introduce 'Value Types' to Java, was announced back in 2014 and still has no release date. Project Loom, which brings green threads, was announced in 2018 and is in a similar state. Want to interop with native code, one still has to deal with the insanity of 20-year-old JNI interfaces.</p><p>One also wonders, even after these features are introduced, how compelling would they be to use compared to their implementations in other languages/runtimes. Java's Achilles heel after all is the need to maintain backward compatibility. Its that backward compatibility requirement that got us the Java Streams API, where instead of <code>myList.map(...)</code> one has to write the monstrosity that is <code>myList.stream().map(...).collect(Collectors.toList()</code>.</p><p>There was a time where Java was the best choice for almost everything. GWT on the frontend, Spring on the backend. Databases like Hadoop, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Spark, all written on top of the JVM. Java also had the absolute best IDE in Eclipse and Intellij, making it a reason to choose Java over other languages in a professional environment.</p><p>What's different in the 2020s is that over the last decade, languages/runtimes have evolved to become best in class for specific domains. They took their learnings for the JVM, finally realizing that type safety is needed, performance is important. They ackonowledged that one language/runtime doesnt fit all needs.</p><ul><li>Want to write a large, complicated UI? ReactJS and Typescript allow you to do that while providing a type system even more expressive than the JVM.</li><li>Want to write a web server? Golang allows you to handle thousands of requests at a time without the need for a thread per request. It makes concurrency so easy, the equivalent in Java would be an order of magnitude more complex.</li><li>Want to write a big data database? Rust has you covered. Deal with huge amounts of data without needing to battle the GC and interact with low-level system calls without battling with JNI or <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>.</li></ul><p>With all these languages being fully typed, Jetbrains now has been able to make equally good IDE for those languages too.</p><p>From 2020 onwards, the JVM doesn't seem to be the best choice for anything. It will continue its legacy as a big, heavyweight, one size fits all VM. Good at everything, but never the best. The future is polyglot and it's free of the JVM.</p>

for the main definitions.</em></p><p>With <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborazione_del_linguaggio_naturale"><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></a>
we refer to that interdisciplinary research field that embraces computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics,
whose purpose is to develop algorithms capable of analyzing, representing and therefore "understanding"
natural language, written or spoken, in a similar or even more efficient way than human beings.</p><p>Huge amounts of text and speech content are generated and stored nowadays. Very often
no use is made of this data, unaware of the fact that instead they represent an invaluable source of value, thanks to which
it is possible to create tools and applications which can bring a considerable added value.</p><p>By exploiting the textual and vocal content available, it is possible, for example, to create tools for::</p><ul><li><strong>Named Entity Recognition</strong>: recognize and extract entities and semantic information from the text.</li><li><strong>Text Classification</strong>: classify textual content, for example the sentiment analysis of a text (positive or negative).</li><li><strong>Entity linking</strong>: disambiguate the entities identified in the text (link the textual entities to identifying concepts).</li><li><strong>Topic Modeling</strong>: automatically extract the main topics present in a textual corpus.</li><li><strong>Autocompletion</strong>: autocompletion of a query for example.</li><li><strong>Machine translation</strong>: translation of textual content from one language to another.</li><li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: transformation of voice content into textual content (technology behind chatbots).</li></ul><p>In this first article we will cover the task known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition"><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</strong></a>.
We will see how it is possible to create a tool capable of recognizing entities in the text and what are some of its possible applications.</p><p>The Named Entity Recognition is placed within that subclass of task which in NLP is defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction"><strong>Information Extraction</strong></a>.
Through NER it is possible to identify entities in the text and associate them with the corresponding semantic categories such as persons, organizations, entities of
geopolitical type, geographic, numbers, temporal expressions and so on.</p><figure>

  </figure>   <p>We are talking about a task that has had a strong development in recent times, especially thanks to the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"><strong>Deep Learning</strong></a>.
The use of very deep neural networks has greatly increased and improved the effectiveness of entity recognition tools. <br>
Before the advent of Deep Learning, the most used tool was the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">Hidden Markov Model</a>,
a statistical model based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>, but that did not guarantee
the same performance as today's Deep Learning-based models. <br>
Two examples of training models for entity recognition will be shown later in the article, both based on the use of algorithms
made with neural networks.</p><p>The task of the Named Entity Recognition is addressed through approaches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"><strong>supervised type</strong></a>,
and for this reason it is necessary to have a set of labeled data available in order to train a model to recognize entities.
Each textual content must be labeled with the list of tokens and related tags for each entity that is to be recognized in the text.</p><p>There are several formats to represent a training dataset for Named Entity Recognition. Let's see the two most used.</p><p>A first format is the one called <strong> BILUO </strong> scheme, where the different parts of the entities are mapped according to the scheme in Figure 2.
Entities are tagged with the semantic category preceded by one of the defined prefixes.</p><figure>

This is because, through the multi-prefix scheme, they specify more detailed information in the text, which improves the capabilities of
learning of the Machine Learning algorithm used. <br>
But even using the IOB and jsonl format, very often it is possible to achieve noteworthy performance. <br>
Switching between formats is relatively simple and can be accomplished by defining rules-based procedures
easy intuition.
In addition, many NLP libraries already define predefined functions to transform your dataset into the desired format.</p><p>To label and transform data into one of these formats, there are ad hoc tools called <strong> annotators </strong>.
An annotator allows you to upload your data as plain text and then label it in a graphical environment which makes the annotation process more agile.
Annotators allow you to label data for NER, but also for textual classification tasks rather than sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p><p>In the case of NER, an annotator presents a graphic like the one below in the figure, with functionalities that allow
to carry out the annotation activity simply by highlighting the text and specifying the label to assign.</p><figure>

These tend to be generic datasets, with entities labeled with semantic categories relating to personal names, organizations, locations, dates,
temporal entities; however, it is also possible to find datasets labeled, concerning to more specific domains.
These datasets are almost always in English, but very often this problem can be overcome by using machine translation tools before carrying out
the activity of Named Entity Recognition, translating the content from the Italian language to the English language, and vice versa.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the tagged datasets on the net:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus?select=ner_dataset.csv"><strong>Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition</strong></a>: dataset

Natural Language Processing. These tools provide both pre-trained templates that are easy to use and quickly integrate into your code, and the
possibility to train new ones with your own data, using predefined modules that simplify the training of new Machine Learning tools. <br>

	  <p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot</a> is a low-cost robot kit for students, software engineers, makers to learn <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/">ROS2</a> and robotics in a hands-on manner. Our robot kits are easy to build, extensible, and customizable. The Hadabot software stack consists of an open source web browser-based coding environment to make the hacking experience frustration-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot ROS2 "Turtle" robot kits are available for purchase</a>!</p>
<hr>
<p>In a previous post, we showcased the <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/">ROS 2 turtlesim</a> running with the <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/">Navigation2 (aka Nav2)</a> package. That exercise required the use of the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a> which manages all <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/ros2-navigation-tf2-tutorial-using-turtlesim.html#what-is-tf2">the various coordinate frames of a robotics application</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, instead of turtlesim, we'll have Nav2 direct a physical Hadabot Turtle differential drive robot to a goal pose - position and orientation. This exercise will bring together rviz, tf2, Nav2 with our past writeups about the <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/implement-ros2-odometry-using-vscode-in-web-browser.html">Turtle robot's odometry and kinematics</a>. We'll touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How we compute odometry for Nav2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nav2 parameters we tweaked</p>

<h3>1. ROS 2 Nav2 with a Hadabot Turtle robot</h3>
<p>As with all Hadabot examples, you can use the Hadabot stacks browser-based VSCode to compile and run the code.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up / update your turn-key Hadabot software stack (which leverages Docker containers to ensure your code runs securely and efficiently on your local machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>you are new to Hadabot</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/new-user-software-stack-setup.html" target="_blank">steps to set up Docker and get the Hadabot software stack up and running</a> (5 to 15 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else if you are a <strong>returning Hadabot hacker</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/software-stack-update.html" target="_blank">steps to update your Hadabot software stack</a> (1-3 minutes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://localhost:9123/?folder=/home/hadabot/hadabot_main/content/p9" target="_blank">Launch the browser-based VSCode workspace specific to this post</a> (this link points to your localhost so everything is running securely on your local system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left VSCode Explorer panel, right-click the <strong>README.md</strong> file -&gt; Open Preview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the README to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update your ROS 2 packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flash the example's ESP32 firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle robot controller and coordinate frame code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch a browser-based VNC client to run the example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a go-to-goal Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/goSqLnv6jhE?start=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h5>Rviz to visualize the Nav2 go-to-goal Hadabot Turtle example</h5>
<p>If you successfully ran the example, you'll notice that the Turtle starts in the middle of the "arena" (ie map). Each grid-box represents 1 meter in physical distance. The red-axis presents the Turtle pointed forward. Since ROS uses a right-handed coordinate system, positive <span>\(\omega\)</span> rotation results in the Turtle turning counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>For the video example, the goal pose was 1 meter to the Turtle's left, with a 90 degree orientation from its initial orientation. </p>
<p>Notice the Turtle didn't end up exactly 1 meter to its left, nor was it oriented exactly 90 degrees from its initial pose. This is due to 2 reasons due to nothing happening exactly in the real world (this is not a simulation anymore Dorothy) - (1) the Hadabot Turtle's speed sensors have errors which accumulates over time resulting in odometry drift, and (2) Nav2 goal checker allows for a tolerance in both distance and orientation from the specificed end-goal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. How we construct TF2 messages from odometry</h3>
<p>The Hadabot Turtle publishes each wheel's rotational velocity in radians per second. With the measured wheelbase and wheel radius of the Turtle, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead-reckoning</a> to determine how far each wheel has traveled in meters.</p>
<p>Once we know how far each wheel has traveled for our differential drive model, we can compute the linear distance and angular rotation <span>\((v, \omega)\)</span> for a unicycle model, which allows us to update the current pose and velocities of our Hadabot Turtle as an <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html">Odometry ROS message</a>. All this is done in the <em>hadabot_controller.cpp</em> file.</p>
<p>Then we use effectively the same code as the turtlesim example to extract the pose information from the Odometry message and publish that out as tf2 messages which is used by Nav2 and rviz.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Setting up Nav2 for the Hadabot Turtle</h3>
<p>Nav2 is a complex ROS 2 package with a number of sub-packages / components around 3 main capabilities - localization, planning/controller, and mapping. For our go-to-goal example, we mainly use the planning/controller component.</p>
<p>There are conceptually 2 types of planners in Nav2 - a global planner, and a local planner. The global planner computes a global trajectoy to get to our goal pose. The local planner references the global plan to determine the best linear and angular velocity for the robot to undertake to safely move along the global trajectory. </p>
<p>The global planner (as of 2020-12) defaults to a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> based planner. The local planner is called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/236487972">DWB planner, initially created by David Lu back in the ROS 1 days</a>, which implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm</a> created by Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun. The DWB planner is driven by "critics" which vote on various local trajectories to undertake. Each critic "cares" about a certain behavior (ie avoiding abstacles, avoiding oscillation, going fast, etc). The local trajectory with the highest vote wins and that results as the Twist message command to direct the robot's current velocities.</p>
<p>Configuring Nav2 for our go-to-goal example involved tuning the parameters for the planning/controller. The ones we tweaked for the Hadabot Turtle are the max velocities of our robot, and controller update frequency (to update frequently enough but not so much that it floods our "hobbyist" network capabilities). There are many other <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/index.html">Nav2 parameters we can consider and tune</a>, which can be a series of posts and exercises on its own. </p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this post, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Showed a example of running a physical real-life Hadabot Turtle robot using ROS 2 Nav2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We described how we use dead-reckoning to compute the Turtle's pose and velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked a bit about Nav2 and what we tweaked to get our goal-to-goal example to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In future posts, we can take this exercise down 2 separate threads - (1) to walk through some of the Nav2 parameters in more detail, start looking closer at Nav2, or (2) to showcase a Hadabot Turtle with a skirt of range-sensors (add-on for the base Turtle kit) to further explore localization and then SLAM with Nav2.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with various professors to create a more structured ROS 2 robotics syllabus and curriculum.</p>

            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy, intended to illustrate in the simplest possible way how specialization gets punished when transfers are taxed in proportion to their values. The current reality not <em>nearly</em> this bad due to many complex exemptions, as I discuss at the end. But the flaw described <em>does</em> exist and <em>does</em> punish specialization. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WHERE THE SAME UNIT OF VALUE IS TAXED MULTIPLE TIMES PLEASE READ THIS LINK.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/vat.jpg" alt="vat"></p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>

      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

  <li>The initial map is based on Wikipedia, but found that many places (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/thailand/corporate/other-taxes">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/05/tnf-saudi-arabia-vat-rate-to-increase-to-15-percent-covid-19.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran#Value_added_tax_(VAT)">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/om/en/pages/tax/articles/oman-to-implement-vat-from-2021.html">Oman</a>, <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/valueaddedtaxvat">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-economy-tax-idUSKCN1IG0OW">Kuwait</a>, <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-early-days-for-angola-value-added-tax">Angola</a>, <a href="https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/liberia-to-introduce-vat-2019.html">Liberia</a>) have recently implemented VAT. I checked that most of the others (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jordan/corporate/other-taxes">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/france/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/7685.aspx?lang=eng#valuetax">French Guinana</a>, <a href="https://www.nordeatrade.com/en/explore-new-market/cuba/taxes">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/libya/individual/other-taxes">Libya</a>, Hong Hong) still do not have a VAT.</li>
  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">YES</a>.</li>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Can we build a fully-fledged Federated Learning system in less than 20 lines of code? Spoiler alert: yes, we can.</p><p><a href="https://flower.dev/">Flower</a> was built with a strong focus on usability. This blog post shows how we can use Flower and <a href="https://tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> to train <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381">MobilNetV2</a> on <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> - in just 19 lines of code.
The system will start one server and two clients, each holding their own local dataset.</p><h2>Flower client</h2><p>Let's first build the client in <code>client.py</code>.
The client starts by importing Flower (<code>flwr</code>) and TensorFlow, compiling the model (MobileNetV2), and loading the data (CIFAR-10):</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span></span><span>import</span><span> tensorflow </span><span>as</span><span> tf
</span>
<span></span><span># Load and compile Keras model</span><span>
</span><span>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2((</span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>), classes=</span><span>10</span><span>, weights=</span><span>None</span><span>)
</span><span>model.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>"adam"</span><span>, </span><span>"sparse_categorical_crossentropy"</span><span>, metrics=[</span><span>"accuracy"</span><span>])
</span>
<span></span><span># Load CIFAR-10 dataset</span><span>
</span>(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
</code></pre></article></div><p>This should look familiar to anyone who has prior experience with TensorFlow or Keras.
Next, we build a Flower client called <code>CifarClient</code> which is derived from Flower's convenience class <code>KerasClient</code>.
The abstract base class <code>KerasClient</code> defines three methods that clients need to override.
These methods allow Flower to trigger training and evaluation of the previously defined Keras model:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Define Flower client</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CifarClient</span><span>(</span><span>fl.client.keras_client.KerasClient</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_weights</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights()
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<span>        model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=</span><span>1</span><span>, batch_size=</span><span>32</span><span>, steps_per_epoch=</span><span>3</span><span>)  </span><span># Remove `steps_per_epoch=3` to train on the full dataset</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights(), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train)
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<!-- -->        loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(x_test), loss, accuracy</span></code></pre></article></div><p>Flower's <code>KerasClient.fit</code> method receives weights from the server, updates the model with those weights, trains the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_train</code>/<code>y_train</code>), and then returns the updated weights (via <code>model.get_weights</code>).
Note that you can do a quick "dry run" by passing <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to <code>model.fit</code> - this will only process three batches per epoch instead of the entire dataset.
Remove <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to train on the full dataset (this will take longer).</p><p>The <code>evaluate</code> method works similarly, but it uses the provided weights to evaluate the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_test</code>/<code>y_test</code>).
The last step is to create an instance of <code>CifarClient</code> and run it:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Start Flower client</span><span>
</span><span>fl.client.start_keras_client(server_address=</span><span>"[::]:8080"</span><span>, client=CifarClient())</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it for the client. We create the model, load the data, implement a subclass <code>KerasClient</code>, and start the client. Let's build the server script next.</p><h2>Flower server</h2><p>In a new script called <code>server.py</code>, we add the following two lines to start a Flower server that performs three rounds of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf">Federated Averaging</a>:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span>fl.server.start_server(config={</span><span>"num_rounds"</span><span>: </span><span>3</span><span>})</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it! We can now run our system. Are we still within our lines of code limit? Lines of code (excluding blank lines or comments): 19 <!-- -->🎉</p><h2>Running the system</h2><p>First, we start the server:</p><p>Next, we open a new terminal and start the first client:</p><p>Finally, we open another new terminal and start the second client:</p><p>This should result in the following output in terminal 2 or 3 (one of those running <code>client.py</code>).
We can see that three rounds of federated learning improve the accuracy to about 46% on the training set and 28% on the test set (if we train on the full dataset, so no <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code>).
There's obviously lots of room for improvement, for example, by doing more rounds of federated learning and by tuning hyperparameters. </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>DEBUG flower </span><span>2020</span><span>-12</span><span>-04</span><span> </span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>57</span><span>:</span><span>18</span><span>,</span><span>259</span><span> | connection.py:</span><span>36</span><span> | ChannelConnectivity.IDLE

    <p><a href="https://ssb.fit/"><em>Smash Training</em></a> is a spaced-repetition training web-app I created to help my progression with <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. I released it on May 16, 2020 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gkybpe/trying_to_get_into_elite_smash_this_quarantine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a> to warm reception. As of December 2020, it receives 150-200 monthly users. I’d rank it as my most successful project!</p>

<p>In this article, I discuss the choices I made for this project. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining">https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining</a>.</p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project requirements</h2>

<p>I decided that I wanted to build a spaced-repetition training app, rather than reuse a general-purpose spaced-repetition flash-card system such as Anki, because the project would benefit from domain-specific knowledge. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercises have large numbers of variants, such as “short-hop” vs “full-hop”, or “facing left” vs “facing right”, which should be tracked separately.</li>
  <li>Many of the exercises have natural dependencies on others: they shouldn’t be attempted unless a certain underlying fundamental skill has been mastered.</li>
  <li>Exercises to train one character don’t necessarily confer the same skill for other characters. Some exercises may only be applicable to some characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to make an app to automate the spaced repetition regimen I was attempting to follow by hand, which I could then share with others.</p>

<p>Here were my engineering requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should be mobile-first, but preferably also available on desktop.</li>
  <li>Should be local-first, or at least not require creating an account to use.</li>
  <li>Should be architected to support sync between devices, although the sync itself was not a requirement for the first iteration.</li>
  <li>Should have approximately zero hosting costs.</li>
  <li>Should be hosted on of a stable platform which doesn’t require monitoring (e.g. not my home computer).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain name</h2>

<p>I wanted to choose between a permutation like the following for the domain name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smashtraining.com</li>
  <li>ssbtraining.com</li>
  <li>smash.training</li>
  <li>ssb.training</li>
  <li>smash.fit</li>
  <li>ssb.fit</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I used <code>ssb.fit</code> because 1) <code>smash.training</code> got taken (!) and 2) I wanted to optimize for typing it in on a mobile device, even though the name is less memorable. This lack of memorability unfortunately manifested in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gp9sem/wtf_was_that_smash_training_website_called/frkscwe/?context=3">this Reddit thread titled “WTF was that smash training website called?”</a>. However, another commenter writes “ssb.fit is better, short for mobile”, perhaps vindicating the original choice.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that the domain name and the website title don’t exactly match up. Many people seemed to address it as “ssb.fit” hence, so maybe that’s what the project should have been called too (rather than “Smash Training”).</p>

<h2 id="user-studies-and-ui">User studies and UI</h2>

<p>I conducted several user studies with friends and family, including some people who had played Smash before and some who hadn’t.</p>

<h3 id="ui">UI</h3>

<p>The first main thing I iterated on was the design of the exercise tracker widget. I originally based it off of the <em>Stronglifts</em> app:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png" alt="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app." title="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p><em>Stronglifts</em> has you note down how many repetitions of the exercise you succeeded at (out of five). However, the <em>Smash Training</em> paradigm is different, and has you repeat the exercise for a length of time and rate your accuracy.</p>

<p>I experimented with a “smiley-face” UI rather than a rep-count UI, as in Stronglifts, along with a few other options. After a lot of feedback from friends, I arrived at a slider-based widget like this:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png" alt="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget." title="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This uses a slider approach (with five possible notches), and renders a description of what each notch corresponds to, i.e. “all or nearly all reps correct”.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>The second main thing was the ordering of the elements in the “Learn exercise” page. Each exercise has a step-by-step description of how to do the exercise, what controller inputs must be performed, background on the technique and its importance, a video tutorial, etc.</p>

<p>My assumption was that most people would read very little of it, so I should put the most important items first. However, various users disagreed on which item was the most important. There was no strong consensus, but the end result was this ordering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step-by-step exercise description.</li>
  <li>Controller inputs.</li>
  <li>Technique overview.</li>
  <li>The rest of the documentation elements (not as important).</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also hints on these steps such as how to enter the Training Stage to perform the exercises. Some users missed these steps altogether, and were left confused on how to perform the exercise. Unfortunately, I was unable to design a UI that mitigated this problem.</p>

<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h2>

<p>I chose to write a web-app, since they are cross-platform and I already had some familiarity with the area. In particular, I didn’t want to spend money on an iOS developer license, but I also didn’t want to exclude iOS users. (Post-hoc analytics indicate that the ratio of Android-to-iOS users is about 2:1, which consitutes a significant cohort for iOS.)</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build system</h3>

<p>All Javascript web-app bundling solutions are fundamentally terrible, and Webpack is no exception. But it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/f621f02af95da697435cb720563b590d57f38b87">I encountered one mysterious bug in Babel during development</a>, which I was unable to isolate. I worked around it by targeting only newer browsers, after which the problem disappeared.</p>

<p>I used <code>vue-cli-service</code> as a wrapper around the build, test, and lint actions, as recommended by Vue. But I found it hard to configure and debug. When I had an issue with tests not properly compiling an imported module, <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/blame/d0c31a33ab880e8c58824c0f58247c8bd8f38485/src/utils.ts#L38-L44">I gave up and reimplemented the function I needed myself</a>.</p>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, since I find its static typing system useful for maintenance purposes.</p>

<p>TypeScript support for Vue was not ideal. Many Vue patterns are not easy to express in TypeScript. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/istrib/vuex-typescript"><code>vuex-typescript</code></a> exist, but require a lot of boilerplate in order to get static typing support. The <a href="https://github.com/paroi-tech/direct-vuex"><code>direct-vuex</code></a> library had less boilerplate, but <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/9a8c0c0baf05d048a564b11f62afdfafc9f66a62">I couldn’t figure out how to test it</a>.</p>

<p>TypeScript was generally pleasant to work with, although in the project, I pushed it to its extremes and it was unable to keep pace. In my case, it was unable to track associated/mapped types adequately. It’s perhaps exemplified by this <code>@ts-ignore</code> comment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>TechVariantOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TechId</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// @ts-ignore "Type 'x' cannot be used to index type 'AllTechVariants'."</span>
  <span>// Strangely, the correct type is calculated here anyways, and can be used for</span>
  <span>// exhaustiveness-checking later.</span>
  <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>AllTechMetadata</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>variants</span><span>"</span><span>]]:</span> <span>AllTechVariants</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13215#issuecomment-531632919">this issue</a> when working on the same thing.</p>

<p>Given that this is reasonably advanced type-level hackery, I was generally happy with TypeScript’s ability to describe the data domain.</p>

<h3 id="vue">Vue</h3>

<p>I chose to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> as the front-end web framework, since I had heard good things about it from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. In particular, I wanted an opinionated framework, so as to spend less time configuring things myself.</p>

<p>When I used it, Vue promoted the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">“single-file component”</a> system, in which HTML, CSS, and Javascript are mixed into the same file. It was not a great experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This complicates the build process, as something has to convert these single-file components into assets consumable by the browser.</li>
  <li>The mental model is an extra layer of indirection, as these single-file components are themselves compiled into Javascript classes, but also contain Javascript classes in the script portion of the file.</li>
  <li>The tooling support was poor. For example, go-to-definition doesn’t work on the HTML components, despite the fact that they’re ultimately backed by Javascript classes.</li>
  <li>TypeScript does not check the HTML components.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would have preferred to use a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">JSX</a> solution, as it removes some of the indirection and has better tooling support.</p>

<p>I wish Vue had fewer ways to do things. For example, attributes on HTML elements can be set with the normal <code>=</code> syntax, but also with a leading <code>:</code> (expression evaluation) or a leading <code>@</code> (callback) for brevity. In comparison, React with JSX only has <code>=</code> for all of these situations.</p>

<h3 id="vuetify">Vuetify</h3>

<p><a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/">Vuetify</a> is a library to provide Material Design UI for Vue. The presence of a solid, all-in-one Material Design library was one other reason why I chose to use Vue. The library and documentation are both very good, and I was able to prototype my app (from a UI perspective) effectively. I would strongly recommend it if you’re using Vue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/8877">I opened one pull request</a> for the documentation, which was merged promptly, <a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/10140">and +1’d one documentation issue</a>, which has a workaround but unfortunately remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="netlify-for-hosting">Netlify for hosting</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host the front-end of the website using its free tier, and stored data locally for the user. This worked well, as Netlify knew how to build and deploy my Vue project, and had good Github integrations.</p>

<p>Another option would have been Github Pages, which would have made the project dependent on fewer underlying services, but also would have required me to write a build step of my own.</p>

<h3 id="custom-database">Custom database</h3>

<p>I stored data locally on the client using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"><code>localStorage</code> APIs</a>. I was careful to design the data schema such that it was append-only and such that each record had a unique ID, the idea being to make it easy to merge changes from multiple clients. However, this alone makes it difficult to delete records without some more thought.</p>

<p>I later discovered <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> as a distributed document-store in exactly the manner I had already architected my application, but including sync and delete capabilities. I also discovered the <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> library, which exposes a CouchDB interface and allows you to store your data locally or sync it remotely. It also supports more backends than just <code>localStorage</code>.</p>

<p>I wish I had used PouchDB from the beginning! Now I’m stuck with an inefficient, feature-lacking implementation of it, which would …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I recently created a series of articles and videos that goes through the
development of Kubernetes custom resources and controllers (see
<a href="https://gum.co/kubernetes-crds">gum.co/kubernetes-crds</a>), but I missed that
nice catchy example that would showcase what custom resources are all about.</p>
<p>So, why not implement the ultimate missing feature that Kubernetes should have?</p>

<h2 id="wait-but-why">wait, but why?</h2>
<p>no no, wait, <strong>why not</strong>?</p>
<p>see, with CI/CD being part of Kubernetes through projects like Argo and Tekton,
where you declare what your pipeline/workflow will be in terms of Kubernetes
resources, we’re now able to get that nice pizza for the team after a
successfull release.</p>

</code></pre><p>i don’t know about you, but that sounds quite right to me <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<h2 id="installation">installation</h2>
<p>being a legit Kubernetes custom resource, you install it just like you would
install Tekton, kpack, or anything like that: you submit a manifest that
contains the <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> objects to Kubernetes, a <code>Deployment</code>
that materializes the controller as a container in a pod, and then … that’s
it!</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller
cd pizza-controller

kapp deploy -a pizza-controller -f ./config/release.yaml


# OR .. plain old kubectl
#
kubectl apply -f ./config/release.yaml
</code></pre><h2 id="but-thats-dumb">but, that’s dumb</h2>
<p>i disagree</p>
<p>I think it’s a pretty cool example of the concepts behind extending
kubernetes via custom resources, and something that might bring you some
thoughts of ways in which you could bring the
declarative nature of Kubernetes objects plus the level-triggered approach to
controllers to bring to Kubernetes the ability to request external resources.</p>
<p>for instance, projects like <a href="https://crossplane.io/">crossplane</a> give you pretty
much that, except that instead of ordering a pizza, you’re ordering … a
database (or things like that).</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h2>
<p>are you <em>really</em> into ordering pizza using <code>kubectl</code>?</p>
<p>like, really? are you sure?</p>
<p>here’s what’s missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>well, any .. tests :horse:</li>
<li>order tracking (it’s <code>xml</code>-based - SOAP stuff)</li>
<li>being more flexible with non-canadian folks (it’s currently hardcoded for
Canada, but could easily be changed)</li>
</ul>
<p>at the moment I got my pizza .. development finished :sweat_smile: maybe you’ll
carry it forward? head to <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller">https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller</a></p>

<p>It's been a really long ride at <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a>.</p><p>I've been through the highest highs, and the lowest lows.</p><p>But now, looking back on it all, with $9.99 coming into my bank account every month <em>just like clockwork</em>, I can definitively say:</p><p>It's all been worth it.</p><p>Here is the story of how I managed to turn 7 years of my life into cold, hard cash.</p><p>And not just any amount of cash.</p><p>$9.99 so far.</p><h2 id="you-can-t-succeed-without-starting">You can't succeed without starting</h2><p>7 years ago, I was just another incredibly privileged highly-skilled software developer whose parents can support him indefinitely meaning he doesn't have to get a proper job and can risk it all on starting a business, even though his Uncle Les offered him a good, stable living as a junior accountant at his firm, as his mum never goddamn stops reminding him.</p><p>Today, I am the CEO of a successful startup.</p><p>How did I get there?</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>I started.</p><p>One day, I woke up and navigated to <a href="https://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a>.</p><p>You might not have heard of it if you aren't a software developer.</p><p>It's a place you go to buy startup websites.</p><p>It's really that simple. You think of a name, and then you go there and type it in.</p><p>In <em>seconds, </em>you'll have results showing you whether your name is available.</p><p>For me, it took a few tries to get it right. I started off trying <code>business.com</code> Â&nbsp;because I wanted my business to have a name that made it clear that it was a business.</p><p>But it was already taken.</p><p>So I moved onto <code>company.com</code>. That was taken too.</p><p>Eventually I landed on https://cloak.ist.</p><p>The journey had started.</p><h2 id="the-long-hard-slog">The long hard slog</h2><p>But boy, it was one hell of a journey.</p><p>This is where another key startup concept comes in:</p><p><em>The pivot.</em></p><p>I wasn't always banking hot, fresh Benjamins from selling custom domains as a service, like I do now.</p><p>I went through 365 different products <em>a year</em> before I settled on custom domains.</p><p>You might be thinking 'Huh, strange â€“ that's the exact number of days in a year'.</p><p>You've hit the nail on the head. Cloakist started off by offering NCaaS.</p><p>Neighborhood-Chores-as-a-service.</p><p>They say you should start with a problem that you see in real life.</p><p>Well, in my mum's neighborhood, I saw hundreds of problems.</p><p>And there were people willing to pay for <em>all of them!</em></p><p>There was Mr Baxter, whose toilet got blocked by his cat. That was a particularly hard pivot to make.</p><p>There were many, many clients in the plus-age category who needed ambulatory assistance with regards to pedestrian activity.</p><p>In other words, they needed help crossing the road.</p><p>And there was teaching coding to the kids at the local primary school, until the bullying became too much for me to handle.</p><p>But here's why none of those NCaaS offerings could ever have worked:</p><p><em>I wasn't getting recurring revenue.</em></p><p>None of my customers came back for a second time.</p><p>It wasn't anything to do with me.

December 11, 2020 | https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html">archive.org</a>

    <p>Rust has an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-next/dbg-macro.html">amazing dbg macro</a> that lets you quickly set up an expression printer that will also put in the source line. It also returns the value of the expression so you can even easily inline the printing when you want to! </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Doing a bunch of Python, I <em>want this</em> in Python as well. I want a debug macro, one that gives me the file location + the expression used to calculate the value.</p>
<p>My <em>ideal</em> would be to have a function where <code>dbg(foo.bar[1])</code> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>print <code>[source line] foo.bar[1] = &lt;the value&gt;</code></li>
<li>return the value so we can use it within expressions easily</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing this by hand I always reach for <code>f</code>-strings, to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"foo.bar[1]=</span><span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is annoying because you end up typing the same expression twice, you can't inline it, and it just doesn't look very cool.</p>
<p>The first thing when trying to implement this is to come to terms with Python's lack of macros. You can't really mess with the syntax tree, so you're really only operating on calculated values. So it's really hard to capture an expression <em>and its result</em> in a single operation because, well, your expressions get evaluated.</p>
<p>So it'll be hard, to print <code>some_expr = &lt;result of some_expr&gt;</code> without providing the string of <code>some_expr</code> at one point.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, thanks to <code>eval</code>, you can flip this idea on its head. You <em>need</em> the string for the expression, but you don't need the expression itself!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'bar'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar'[]"</span><span>))</span> <span># prints 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One step backwards, let's now go two steps forward. We can start writing our <code>dbg</code> helper function</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"bar"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>  <span># foo['bar'] = 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good, we have a nice pretty printer here at the cost of two quotation marks.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't work perfectly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span> <span># expr = expr</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that when calling <code>eval</code> without arguments we are evaluating <em>within the scope of <code>dbg</code></em>. Our examples work because <code>dbg</code> is defined alongside our expressions (so <code>foo</code> is accessible within <code>dbg</code>) but it's susceptible to name shadowing or outright not being able to calculate the expression because it could be defined in a different scope</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span># we're calculating the result here....</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span># but actually want to calculate</span>
<span># the result within this scope</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>eval</code> by default will evaluate the expression within the current frame. But we can pass in our own globals and locals to instead evaluate the expression within an arbitrary environment</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>}))</span> <span># gives 4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let's reproduce the caller's environment to get us the right results. Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, <em>getting source code</em>, inspecting classes and functions, and <em>examining the interpreter stack</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try out <code>inspect.stack()</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>

<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Passed"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>trying this out, we get the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this is in a function call we'll actually need to go up the stack one frame (<code>inspect.stack()[1]</code>) to get the proper line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'dbg("foo[</span><span>\'</span><span>bar</span><span>\'</span><span>]")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'dbg("expr")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'if dbg("True"):</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, now we are getting closer to where we need. the second element in our stack is where we'll also get the file path and the line number. Let's clean this up a bit and now we get:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we have the full file path... one might do a trick here to stick with the file name:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>filename</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"[</span><span>{</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>{</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>lineno</span><span>}</span><span>] </span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so with this we end up with the following nice printed output</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so this is good on the formatting. But we still haven't fixed <code>eval</code>! That's a tiny fix this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_globals</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_locals</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gets us the right values, properly evaluating <code>expr</code> from the calling scope instead of <code>dbg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> 
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_locals</code> on the frames is still one of my favorite Python features. It lets basically anyone write very good debugging tools without having to do a bunch of magic.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you're an IPython user you can add this to <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-startup-files">a startup script</a>  over in <code>~/.ipython/profile_default/</code> and make this available in any interactive shell.</p>
<p>For those who value silly things like correctness, performance, and intellectual integrity your journey ends here. This is a nice little helper that you can use in your projects, and there's nothing else for you to see here.</p>
<p>For those who like to live dangerously, I have something to show you.....</p>
<p>



So.</p>
<p>Inside the frame, we have a bunch of information, but one thing that's pretty nice for explorative debugging is the <code>code_context</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
<span># prints dbg('foo["bar"]')</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we actually have the source line from the <code>dbg</code> call built in!</p>
<p>Let's imagine going back a bit to our "idealized" debug function:</p>


<p>Now, if we ran such a function, the body would receive the <em>value</em> of <code>foo['bar']</code> and not the expression. <em>But</em> thanks to the stack we could theoretically recover the original expression! </p>
<p>This gets a bit tricker if you want to do more clever stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>)))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
   <span>do_stuff</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But let's try to work this out from first principles a bit.</p>
<p>If you have the source code line with the <code>dbg</code> call, how can you recover the expression being debugged?</p>
<p>The first thing is just to find the beginning of the expression. That's pretty easy, just look for <code>dbg(</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
   ^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we find the beginning of the expression, right? And since a function call in Python is an open parentheses, some expressions, then a close parentheses, we just have to find the close parentheses and we have the string fragment representing our expression. Let's apply the logic here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great! Our expression is <code>my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "(</code>. Definitely what we wanted. Yep.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where the only way to parse out an expression is to actually parse it out. Simple string matching won't cut it, especially when you start getting inner function calls in the mix.</p>
<p>You could write a simple parser, try and count parens, open quotes, escaping in quotes, all the fun little games. But honestly I want a thing that works, and I don't want to think about it too hard.</p>
<p>I just want to find out where the expression is in this string.</p>
<p>So here's my amazing plan to deal with this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == '</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")'</span><span>)</span>
<span># doesn't fail =&gt; I have my expression!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just start with the longest possible string, and slowly shrink it until I find something that looks like an expression. Because the <code>)</code> from the debug call imbalances everything I'm like... 80% sure that this way of finding the expression is correct.</p>
<p>There are some edge cases that make this strategy not work. For example if you do something like:</p>


<p>You have two <code>dbg</code>s on the same line, so it's hard to know <em>which</em> call you're in, because you're only provided the line number. (On some other project I spent a lot of time hand-wringing on this exact problem and could not find a solution, even with tricks like counting executions. I'm fairly convinced this is equivalent to the halting problem somehow)</p>
<p>And to be honest my solution here isn't battle-tested, it just feels right and works with the complicated expressions I've thrown at it. But it was a fun thing to write and now the following works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>])</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 49] foo["bar"] = 3</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 52] my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()") = 5</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Success"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No more stringifying silliness, no more calls to <code>eval</code>, just a really silly parsing hack that has no real foundation except my gut feeling. </p>
<p>Good enough for me!</p>
<p>the final implemetaion is below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Recover the expression giving the result, and then</span>

<p><strong>Download: </strong><a href="http://rickroderick.org/download/1991%20Nietzsche%20and%20the%20Post-Modern%20Condition/2%20-%20Nietzsche%20on%20Truth%20and%20Lie.mov">Nietzsche and the Post-Modern Condition (1991) Lecture 2: Nietzsche on Truth and Lie.mov</a></p>

<p><strong>Transcript: </strong>Lecture two will attempt to answer one of the paradoxes I raised in the first lecture – and this will be a specific form of it – and that’s a rather famous charge in philosophy. In fact this is the charge of relativism and one of the things that professional philosophers do in order to display their professional credentials is to respond to the relativist and to the sceptic. Nietzsche has been accused of being a relativist. One form of this accusation is a kind of mislabelling – in my opinion it’s a mislabelling – of Nietzsche’s view about the function of truth and lie. He opposes that to true and false. Truth and lie. The function of that within philosophical discourse. He has an account of that we are going to discuss. <span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>One of the ways that philosophers have mislabelled this position is “perspectivism”, and the reason I hate that label is like “relativism”, it makes someone think that someone – in this case Nietzsche, or someone else – might hold the absolutely ridiculous view that every view was as good as every other view. That is a complete straw person argument. No-one has ever – or does now – hold the view that every view is as good as every other view.</p>
<p>So whenever the spectre of relativism is raised, you know, by someone for you, either in the popular press or in a university setting, the first small thing that should come to your mind is there aren’t any. So the refutation in a certain sense is bound to miss at least one point, namely that you are not arguing against anyone. Now it could be the case that my audience today, or the audience that will watch the tapes, I will find someone in the United States, or across the world that will hold the view that every other view is as good as every other view. But if I do, it will be very idiosyncratic, and in my experience so far, no.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is not a relativist, and I think perspectivism is also an unfortunate term to describe Nietzsche’s style of thinking. Because perspectivism calls up the idea that, “Well, I am right from my perspective, and you are right from your perspective, and everybody is right from their perspectives”, and I also don’t believe that that’s a view that anyone can hold or has ever held. I think, and this is the the way I will try to discuss Nietzsche’s paradox in terms of relativism, is that…</p>
<p>Nietzsche was opposed to what might be called the dogmatism of not only the Western Philosophical tradition, but the Western Theoretical tradition in general. Its dogmatism in this regard. Believing… about its beliefs that they were good not only for them and their tribe… because after all Western Civilisation is a big word… it’s a strange word… you know, big words and strange words, but, after all it is just a very large tribe with very large armies and lots of televisions… and a large historical project, but still its a tribe. Big, big tribe.</p>
<p>I think Nietzsche considered it dogmatic to hold that your beliefs – or the beliefs of your tribe – were binding on all. That is the way I want to present Nietzsche’s perspectivism. In other words, he didn’t believe that all beliefs were equally good, interesting, or whatever. In fact, I am sure he considered some of his own beliefs to be far more interesting than for example, the beliefs of John Stuart Mill, who he referred to as “That blockhead”. Or I think that he found his views more interesting than the views of the English Utilitarians in general, about whom he said “No human beings want to be happy. Only the British want that”. [crowd laughter]. So I think he thinks his views were more interesting than those.</p>
<p>And I think where the dogmatism for Nietzsche came in was when you search for views… and then develop your beliefs, and then think that they should be binding on all. This is not a criticism that you shouldn’t have beliefs, or that all your beliefs are no better than anyone else’s. It’s just the further belief about your beliefs that everyone else should believe the same damn way. So it’s a meta-belief, if you will. A belief about your beliefs.</p>
<p>In fact I think that it’s perfectly consistent to believe a wide number of things with a great deal of passion, and then believe about those beliefs that you could be wrong. I hope that’s not a further paradox, I do not think that it is. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent to believe something passionately, to believe it in a very deep way and have a belief about that belief that “Well, you know. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p>So the dogmatism that Nietzsche is after runs very deep in our theoretical traditions. I can’t overestimate this. It’s a dogmatism that has continued throughout what might be called the project of the West, and it’s even built into the Socratic pursuit. When Socrates asks the question “What is X?”, and what fills in the “X” are those famous Greek ideals; virtue, excellence, beauty, goodness, and so on. Now Nietzsche had the highest respect for Socrates, and as I just said, as I said before, Nietzsche considered him to be an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary', 'exemplary']);">exemplary</a> person, coupled with Plato’s construction of him, they in a way were ideal for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But the dogmatic part of Socrates was that Socrates wanted – for Nietzsche – Socrates wanted an answer to the question “What is X”, like what is beauty, goodness, truth, excellence. It wouldn’t be good for just Socrates, or good for the Greeks, but once discovered had to bind everyone. In other words, it wouldn’t be enough just to believe it, which seems… what Nietzsche calls the gay, happy theorist to be enough, to just find a belief that you can live with and believe. No, the theoretical enterprise of the West is imperialistic in a way. It’s got to find a belief that others then have to believe, and that he considered dogmatic.</p>
<p>This by the way you may notice is not – in my view – a relativist position at all. Because it’s not inconsistent with the view that you think your beliefs – precisely because they are your beliefs – are superior to some other beliefs. In fact I take it to be banally the case that if you didn’t think that, they wouldn’t be your beliefs. In other words, somebody comes up to you and gives you some other ones and you go “Oh hell, those are better than mine”. Then they will be yours after you have heard them out, right? So it seems fairly natural that you believe your beliefs. The dogmatic assumption is that everyone else should believe your beliefs. And this is not relativism. There have been some modern philosophical names attached to this position called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism', 'fallibilism']);">fallibilism</a>, and yet Nietzsche is too interesting in a certain way to be called that either.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to present Nietzsche not specifically within that philosophical context, but I do want to present him as addressing it, which he does. And anyone who has ever addressed any issue in philosophy knows that the irritating thing is how the simplest questions can turn into philosophical ones. Sometimes philosophers realise that what we do is ask a series of rhetorical questions that come up whenever people are very frustrated. In other words, we ask questions like “What the hell does that mean?”. You know, generally in a fight – a domestic fight – a rhetorical question. “I can’t do the dishes now” – “Well what the hell does that mean?”. Well, the philosopher takes that rhetorical question and just places it in a foreign context. Someone goes “There’s an object” and you go “Object… what the hell does that mean?” [crowd laughter]. In the other context, the remark had a home and a meaning, and so it means that the person’s <em>pissed</em>, I guess. Or <em>upset</em>, okay. In this other context though, “What does it – you know – does it mean?” doesn’t seem to have any purchase.</p>
<p>About those, sort of, metaphysical beliefs, Nietzsche was no metaphysician. In fact, he thought that was, in a way, a very pompous thing to be. To try to answer those kinds of questions in a way binding for all. Now I call that a kind of <em>imperialism</em>, and I didn’t use that political term without thinking about it for a while. It’s the kind of imperialism – this dogmatic tradition against which Socrates saw himself fighting – is the kind of imperialist tradition we might have in some of our educational institutions when we have an African-American student who speaks eloquent rap street language talk. And I am not trying to say that’s all that African-Americans speak. Some of them are Neo-Conservatives that garble around as bad as others. Paleo-Conservatives. You know, some are just as unfortunately stupid as their Anglo-American, or Anglo-Saxon counterparts.</p>
<p>No, but I mean I am talking now about, you know, someone who does… says “ain’t” and repeats themselves, rhymes and things. Well, in a way it’s just imperialistic to think that that is somehow less profound than the Cambridge accent that discusses in detail the problem of relativism. It is not only a class and a racial bias, it’s just stupid. Because, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James', 'William James']);">William James</a> once said “The trail of the human serpent is over all”. There are many forms of life, many cultures, many ways to look at things. And Nietzsche at his best expresses in his work that diversity and that complexity of the many ways to interpret, to speak.</p>
<p>Now, “imperialistic” in this educational sense means that we want you to leave our institutions of higher learning talking like we talk and writing like we write. And we divide through by the issue of whether you think at all, because all the evidence we have for that is what you have said and what you have written. You may be not thinking at all, or thinking very bizarre thoughts, or you may be on some hallucinogenic drug, who knows what’s inside. But if you leave there writing like we write, talking like we talk – in short obeying relations of power – then you are educated. You certainly… and certainly Nietzsche saw this as conformity, and not connected with truth.</p>
<p>So …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p><em>I first met Allan over a Zoom call about a week ago. I have been following <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/">his blog</a> for some time and wanted to know more about his book draft about design patterns in Elixir. It wasn't until the call itself that I found out how many ideas we share - about the future of Elixir, its role as an alternative to present-day distributed solutions, and last but not least, its potential for the next generation of e-commerce solutions. </em></p><h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2><p><strong>Allan:</strong> I'm a software engineer with 15 years of experience, based in Toronto, Ontario. I was born and grew up in Mexico, and over the last 11 years, I have been able to build a career and life in Canada.</p><p>Most of my professional career has been focused on e-commerce development, which I would say can be broken down into three main categories:</p><ul><li>Building user-facing experiences</li><li>Building e-commerce engines to map the business logic</li><li>Integrations with third-party systems</li></ul><p>Over ten years of e-commerce development, I had the opportunity to work with many notable brands in Canada and the US and solve many challenges in the space. I have also dabbled working with product companies in multiple capacities - from CTO to currently a Senior Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.humi.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humi</a>.</p><p>In terms of technologies, I have had a chance to work with many different stacks and programming languages, notably PHP (LAMP), some Ruby on Rails, some Scala during my time at Hopper, and a bit of Elixir to tackle quick prototypes and transparent proxy for an e-commerce project.</p><p>Currently, I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Humi, a great company in the HR and payroll space. I am also building a couple of micro-SaaS projects - the first one being <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGuardian</a>, intended to be a complete solution for website monitoring and security. It should be close to beta release later this month.</p><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Allan: </strong>I stumbled into Elixir in a bit of a weird way, going back to one of the problems that I mentioned on the e-commerce space — integration with third-party systems like ERP, OMS, and the like, — for that kind of problems, the idea of <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/index.html">Flow-based programming</a> made a lot of sense.</p><p>In essence, you structure your application to be a pipeline of black boxes that transform, filter, or handle the data in some way or another. Looking for implementations of this library, I landed on a library called <a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex">FlowEx</a>, which is written in Elixir. As I started diving deeper into the language, I honestly fell in love with it.</p><p>Elixir to me seems like this almost perfect mix of all the right qualities:</p><ul><li>Flexibility and power</li><li>Low Learning curve</li><li>Extensibility</li><li>Expressiveness</li></ul><p>If I had to pinpoint any particular quality of Elixir that caught my attention, it would be the expressiveness of the language - how much you can achieve with very little code.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For me, the biggest challenge was adapting to a new paradigm and getting rid of the "bad" habits I picked up from working with Object-Oriented Languages. It is not the syntax that is different, but how you reason and think about the data flows in your program.</p><p>I guess the other challenging bit, which seems fairly common, was grasping the use of the Enum variable, Map, reduce, and the like. But once those things click, you are off to the races.</p><p>The other challenge that is still somewhat applicable is getting buying for the business or clients to use Elixir as a solution; however, I'm happy to see that it is gaining popularity and is being adopted by larger companies and teams.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>First, it is important to clarify what this next generation of e-commerce solutions looks like. We are currently in transition from the traditional catalog/search &gt; product page &gt; shopping cart &gt; checkout experience; and moving into a stage where e-commerce becomes ubiquitous, for example, integrated into an Instagram post or inside content.</p><p>This kind of change will present a couple of interesting challenges, both in terms of scalability / performance and architectures. The current generation of e-commerce platforms is fairly monolithic, or in the case of some of the SaaS offerings, fairly restrictive.</p><p>I can see an interesting future for Elixir and similar technologies to be used to develop the next generation e-commerce platforms and services; this is especially applicable when talking about integrations between OMS, Inventory systems, and Product Information Management systems.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>Absolutely! Right now, I'm working on a small SaaS project called <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/">SiteGuardian</a>, which aims to provide a robust solution for website site security and availability monitoring.</p><p>I chose Elixir for this project because first, I wanted to validate some architectural ideas and patterns that I'm researching for a book; and second, the Elixir stack allows me to build robust features and do so very efficiently.</p><p>To me, it is that perfect combination of development speed, robustness, and low operating costs that enables me to build a competitive micro-SaaS. Not to mention that my ability to iterate and build in this stack has been incredible compared to if was doing this in Laravel, or Ruby on Rails.</p><p>The second thing that I have in progress right now is a book on Elixir and design patterns. The idea is to explore and do a deep dive into the multiple variations of architectural and behavioral patterns that are relevant to functional programming and Elixir.</p><p>For anyone interested in the progress of the book, you can subscribe to my newsletter here: <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/">https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/</a></p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For people considering using Elixir / Erlang, my word of advice is to give things time to sink in. Functional programming is likely to be a new idea and paradigm and might take a while to grok the concepts, but once you do, the time invested is going to pay off ten-fold.</p><hr><h2 id="references">References</h2><figure><a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/"><div><p>Hi, I’m Allan, this is where I write. - Allan MacGregor</p><p>Expert Software Engineer and Manager • Writer • Functional Programming Advocate</p><p><span>Allan MacGregor</span></p></div><p><img src="https://allanmacgregor.com/static/logo-white-3bbb2d0ba72789f13cdee16471616911.png"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex"><div><p>antonmi/flowex</p><p>Flow-Based Programming framework for Elixir.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he year was 2003, and the first human genome had been <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" target="_blank">sequenced</a>.</p>
<p>By almost every metric, it was an extraordinary achievement. The completion of the Human Genome Project provided a starting point for scientists to study the “<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/" target="_blank">blueprint for building a person</a>”. Pharmaceutical companies suddenly possessed a genetic chart to design more targeted medicines. Archaeologists gained a roadmap to compare human genomes through the ages. Biologists acquired a lodestar to locate the genes governing health and behavior. The floodgates of the genomic era had officially opened. But the project also revealed a mystery.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, scientists <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/5yrplan/index.shtml" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the Human Genome Project would unveil 100,000 human genes. But the sequencing results revealed a stark reality: humans only have 20,000 genes—<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118530" target="_blank">10,000 fewer than a water flea</a>. It seems remarkable that humans—with our fancy bipedalism and oversized brains—could have fewer genes than a microscopic crustacean.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the two decades since the Human Genome Project. The technology to sequence genes has gotten cheaper and faster. The first human genome sequence cost three billion dollars, involved thousands of scientists, and took 13 years to complete. Today, sequencing machines can read a human genome in less than a day for a few hundred dollars. But technology is not a substitute for knowledge, and scientists still don’t fully understand how the genome works.</p>

<p>Nestled in the back corner of the <a href="https://broadfoundation.org/grantees/the-broad-center-for-biological-science-at-caltech/" target="_blank">Broad Center for the Biological Sciences</a> at Caltech, our research laboratory aims to understand how genomes encode and express information. To find us on campus, look for the cubic building made from metal and travertine, with sweeping views of the San Gabriel mountains. On a clear day many months ago, before the pandemic confined us to untidy apartments, we could see Mt. Wilson Observatory from our offices. Its white telescopes dot the mountain’s summit, silhouetted against the rising sun. Inside the lab, our benches are cluttered with liquid-filled bottles and metal pipettes.</p>
<p>We study genomes, in part, because of the impact on our impressionable young minds when the Human Genome Project made national news back in 2003. The structure of DNA had been <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/" target="_blank">established</a> fifty years earlier, thanks to herculean efforts from Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and others. Our understanding of genomes came a long way in those 50 years, from structure to sequence. But we know that there is more to learn.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/01/09/illumina-promises-to-sequence-human-genome-for-100-but-not-quite-yet/#14098b8f386d" target="_blank">500,000 human genomes</a> have been sequenced since 2003. Sequencing machines are now commonplace at universities. Humming on tables, they look like space-age computer systems, with touch screens and tiny, pneumatic tubes. DNA is extracted from living cells, trillions of copies are made using a technique called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matsiHSuoOw&amp;vl=en" target="_blank">PCR</a>, and the copied molecules are loaded (carefully!) into the machine. A few hours later, after the humming subsides, an interminable string of characters appears on the screen, made up of four letters: A, T, C, and G.</p>
<p>All genomes on earth are made up of these letters, called nucleotides. Each letter is a unique molecule—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—that links up to the others, forming a minimal alphabet. With these four letters, our cells construct words, or—in the context of biology—genes.</p>
<p>Much as a Xerox machine can make thousands of copies from a single document, genes are converted to messenger RNA in a process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whV_CkKT7F0" target="_blank">transcription</a>, which then serves as a template to build proteins. The human genome encodes about 20,000 genes, which in turn produce proteins that fend off viral invaders, manage blood sugar levels, and everything in between.</p>
<iframe width="280" height="156" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M198uHJd_8?start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This short animation shows how transcription happens.</p>

<p>But we cannot “see” these dynamic changes with a DNA sequence. The order of letters in a genome tells us nothing about how a gene is controlled in the molecular confines of a cell. Gene expression is dynamic and changing. Genes are turned on and off as proteins are needed, and these changes over time may explain how genomes can give rise to the most beautiful of lifeforms. In other words, it may explain how we are human, despite a trifling 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>We study how genomes are controlled because we want to understand ourselves. In doing so, we are building upon more than 80 years of experimental history.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1940s, Jacques Monod and François Jacob, frantically working in a little laboratory in the Necker neighborhood of Paris, found that cells control protein numbers by turning genes “on” or “off”. Though their results seem obvious today (the best results always do), they shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1965/summary/" target="_blank">1965 Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine for their work.</p>
<p>Genes are regulated by proteins called transcription factors, of which there are two types: activators, which bind to DNA near the start of a gene and increase the amount of mRNA copies made from a gene, much like loading more paper into a Xerox tray, and repressors, which decrease the amount of mRNA copies. Transcription factors hold dominion over the genome, controlling when each gene gets to make its Xerox copies.</p>
<p>Jacob and Monod’s findings provided a potential solution to the question that arose from the first human genome sequence, 60 years later. Perhaps an organism’s complexity is dictated not by how many genes are present in a genome, but rather by how those genomes are controlled, over time, by transcription factors.
To build upon the work of our scientific heroes, our lab at Caltech wanted to determine which type of transcription factor—activator or repressor—regulates each and every gene. To test our experiments, we decided to start with a small genome. We turned to a bacterium, <em>Escherichia coli</em>.</p>
<p>In the grand order of nature, <em>E. coli</em> is relatively simple, containing 4,000 genes and 200 transcription factors. But, despite its meager size, we still do not know how two-thirds of its genes are regulated.</p>

<p>The <i>E. coli</i> genome contains about 4.6 million nucleotides and 4,000 genes. In this diagram, genes that have known regulation (which means that we know which transcription factors regulate them) are marked in blue. For most genes (roughly two-thirds), we have no idea which transcription factors regulate or control them (marked in red).</p>

<p>We knew that if we ever wanted to understand how even a small bacterial genome is regulated, a new experimental method would be needed. So we <i>created</i> one.</p>
<hr>
<p>When <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/theriotlab/members/" target="_blank">Nathan Belliveau</a> joined the lab, a few years ago, his objective was simple: find an easy way to determine how genes in <em>E. coli</em> are regulated.</p>
<p>Sitting at the bench, he harvested genetic material from <em>E. coli</em> and loaded the DNA into a sequencer. After a few years—and hundreds of trials—he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4796" target="_blank">reported</a> the foundations of a radical method that would eventually enable our laboratory to figure out which transcription factors regulate hundreds, or thousands, of genes at a time. Nathan left the group in 2017, PhD in hand, and flew to colder climates. Bill Ireland and Suzy Beeler (an author of this article) took over the project.</p>
<p>They, too, spent years agonizing over the method. After using thousands of tubes of DNA and covering their benches in teetering stacks of bacteria-streaked agar plates, Bill and Suzy managed to extend Nathan’s findings to more than a hundred genes. In the process, they refined a powerful method that lends deep insights into the intricate, molecular machines that regulate genomes.</p>
<p>Here’s how the method works.</p>
<p>We begin by literally mail ordering short sequences of DNA—the regions immediately in front of a gene—where transcription factors typically bind. A computer helps us design mutated versions of each DNA sequence, randomly changing the letters until we have thousands of variants for each sequence. A company in San Francisco takes our digital letters, creates physical copies, and ships them in a little plastic tube to our laboratory. We then place these synthetic pieces of DNA inside of <em>E. coli</em> cells, and use a modified version of DNA sequencing to determine whether each “letter” change made a gene produce more or fewer Xerox copies.</p>
<p>If a DNA sequence produces very little RNA inside of the cell, this suggests that the letter change (or mutation) blocked transcription; it choked up the Xerox machine. It also indicates that an activator was probably binding to that DNA sequence, and the mutation prevented it from doing its job. Some mutations, however, increase the amount of RNA produced from a DNA sequence, suggesting that the mutation is preventing a repressor from binding.</p>
<p>By analyzing this data and running it through mathematical models, we can determine whether each gene is regulated by an activator or repressor, how many transcription factors regulate each gene, and where those transcription factors actually bind.</p>
<p>In other words, we can map the genome’s regulatory networks.</p>

<p>After performing this experiment on more than one hundred genes, we made some startling discoveries. In one case, we found a transcription factor with dual activity: it activated the transcription of one gene while repressing the transcription of another. We also identified transcription factors that are only active in certain environments; when <em>E. coli</em> is grown in the presence of a sugar, for example, a transcription factor called GlpR represses a handful of genes. Without the sugar, GlpR doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55308" target="_blank">study</a> marks a major advancement in genomic research. But it didn’t come for free.</p>
<p>Throughout the last five years, we have failed repeatedly. We have mislabeled tubes and used ethanol instead of water to dilute DNA. We have dropped flasks, shattering glass and spilling bacteria on the floor. We have been frustrated, again and again. But we continued on, inching closer …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>P</span>rogrammers normally want to minimize the time their code takes to execute. But in 1962, the Hungarian mathematician Tibor RadÃ³ posed the opposite problem. He asked: How long can a simple computer program possibly run before it terminates? RadÃ³ nicknamed these maximally inefficient but still functional programs â€œbusy beavers.â€�</p>

<p>Finding these programs has been a fiendishly diverting puzzle for programmers and other mathematical hobbyists ever since it was popularized in Scientific Americanâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computer-recreations-1984-08/" target="_blank">â€œComputer Recreationsâ€� column</a>&nbsp;in 1984. But in the last several years, the busy beaver game, as itâ€™s known, has become an object of study in its own right, because it has yielded connections to some of the loftiest concepts and open problems in mathematics.</p>
<p>â€œIn math, there is a very permeable boundary between whatâ€™s an amusing recreation and what is actually important,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson" target="_blank">Scott Aaronson</a>, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin who published a&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3427361.3427369" target="_blank">survey</a>&nbsp;of progress in â€œBusyBeaverology.â€�<br></p>
<p>The recent work suggests that the search for long-running computer programs can illuminate the state of mathematical knowledge, and even tell us whatâ€™s knowable. According to researchers, the busy beaver game provides a concrete benchmark for evaluating the difficulty of certain problems, such as the unsolved Goldbach conjecture and Riemann hypothesis. It even offers a glimpse of where the logical bedrock underlying math breaks down. The logician Kurt GÃ¶del proved the existence of such mathematical terra incognita nearly a century ago. But the busy beaver game can show where it actually lies on a number line, like an ancient map depicting the edge of the world.</p><p><strong>An Uncomputable Computer Game</strong></p>
<p>The busy beaver game is all about the behavior of Turing machines—the primitive, idealized computers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" target="_blank">conceived by Alan Turing in 1936</a>. A Turing machine performs actions on an endless strip of tape divided into squares. It does so according to a list of rules. The first rule might say:</p>
<blockquote>If the square contains a 0, replace it with a 1, move one square to the right and consult rule 2. If the square contains a 1, leave the 1, move one square to the left and consult rule 3.</blockquote>
<p>Each rule has this forking choose-your-own-adventure style. Some rules say to jump back to previous rules; eventually thereâ€™s a rule containing an instruction to â€œhalt.â€� Turing proved that this simple kind of computer is capable of performing any possible calculation, given the right instructions and enough time.</p>
<p>As Turing noted in 1936, in order to compute something, a Turing machine must eventually halt—it canâ€™t get trapped in an infinite loop. But he also proved that thereâ€™s no reliable, repeatable method for distinguishing machines that halt from machines that simply run forever—a fact known as the halting problem.</p>
<p>The busy beaver game asks: Given a certain number of rules, whatâ€™s the maximum number of steps that a Turing machine can take before halting?</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_448ca98db9d7b1349758c6545cdf7237.jpg" alt="nautilus tibor rado"><figcaption><span>Tibor RadÃ³, shown here in an undated photo, invented the busy beaver game as a way of making the theoretical notion of uncomputability concrete. </span><br><span>Courtesy of The Ohio State University Archives</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, if youâ€™re only allowed one rule, and you want to ensure that the Turing machine halts, youâ€™re forced to include the halt instruction right away. The busy beaver number of a one-rule machine, or BB(1), is therefore 1.</p>
<p>But adding just a few more rules instantly blows up the number of machines to consider. Of 6,561 possible machines with two rules, the one that runs the longest—six steps—before halting is the busy beaver. But some others simply run forever. None of these are the busy beaver, but how do you definitively rule them out? Turing proved that thereâ€™s no way to automatically tell whether a machine that runs for a thousand or a million steps wonâ€™t eventually terminate.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why finding busy beavers is so hard. Thereâ€™s no general approach for identifying the longest-running Turing machines with an arbitrary number of instructions; you have to puzzle out the specifics of each case on its own. In other words, the busy beaver game is, in general, â€œuncomputable.â€�</p>
<p>Proving that BB(2) = 6 and that BB(3) = 107 was difficult enough that RadÃ³â€™s student Shen Lin earned a doctorate for the work in 1965. RadÃ³ considered BB(4) â€œentirely hopeless,â€� but&nbsp;the case was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1983-40-162/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6.pdf" target="_blank">finally solved in 1983</a>. Beyond that, the values virtually explode; researchers have identified a five-rule Turing machine, for instance, that runs for 47,176,870 steps before stopping, so BB(5) is at least that big. BB(6) is at least 7.4 Ã— 1036,534.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving the exact values â€œwill need new ideas and new insights, if it can be done at all,â€� said Aaronson.</p>
<p><strong>Threshold of Unknowability</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/" target="_blank">William Gasarch</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park, said heâ€™s less intrigued by the prospect of pinning down busy beaver numbers than by â€œthe general concept that itâ€™s actually uncomputable.â€� He and other mathematicians are mainly interested in using the game as a yardstick for gauging the difficulty of important open problems in mathematics—or for figuring out what is mathematically knowable at all.</p>
<p>The Goldbach conjecture, for instance, asks whether every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Proving the conjecture true or false would be an epochal event in number theory, allowing mathematicians to better understand the distribution of prime numbers. In 2015, an anonymous GitHub user named Code Golf Addict&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6" target="_blank">published code</a>&nbsp;for a 27-rule Turing machine that halts if—and only if—the Goldbach conjecture is false. It works by counting upward through all even integers greater than 4; for each one, it grinds through all the possible ways to get that integer by adding two others, checking whether the pair is prime. When it finds a suitable pair of primes, it moves up to the next even integer and repeats the process. If it finds an even integer that canâ€™t be summed by a pair of prime numbers, it halts.</p>
<p>Running this mindless machine isnâ€™t a practical way to solve the conjecture, because we canâ€™t know if it will ever halt until it does. But the busy beaver game sheds some light on the problem. If it were possible to compute BB(27), that would provide a ceiling on how long weâ€™d have to wait for the Goldbach conjecture to be settled automatically. Thatâ€™s because BB(27) corresponds to the maximum number of steps this 27-rule Turing machine would have to execute in order to halt (if it ever did). If we knew that number, we could run the Turing machine for exactly that many steps. If it halted by that point, weâ€™d know the Goldbach conjecture was false. But if it went that many steps and didnâ€™t halt, weâ€™d know for certain that it never would—thus proving the conjecture true.</p>
<p>The rub is that BB(27) is such an incomprehensibly huge number that even writing it down, much less running the Goldbach-falsifying machine for that many steps, isnâ€™t remotely possible in our physical universe. Nevertheless, that incomprehensibly huge number is still an exact figure whose magnitude, according to Aaronson, represents â€œa statement about our current knowledgeâ€� of number theory.</p>
<p>In 2016, Aaronson established a similar result in collaboration with Yuri Matiyasevich and Stefan Oâ€™Rear. They identified a 744-rule Turing machine that halts if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is false. The Riemann hypothesis also concerns the distribution of prime numbers and is one of the Clay Mathematics Instituteâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/riemann-hypothesis" target="_blank">â€œMillennium Problemsâ€�</a>&nbsp;worth $1 million. Aaronsonâ€™s machine will deliver an automatic solution in BB(744) steps. (It works by essentially the same mindless process as the Goldbach machine, iterating upward until it finds a counterexample.)</p>
<p>Of course, BB(744) is an even more unattainably large number than BB(27). But working to pin down something easier, like BB(5), â€œmay actually turn up some new number theory questions that are interesting in their own right,â€� Aaronson said. For instance, the mathematician Pascal Michel&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409968" target="_blank">proved</a>&nbsp;in 1993 that the record-holding five-rule Turing machine exhibits behavior similar to that of the function described in the Collatz conjecture, another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/" target="_blank">famous open problem</a>&nbsp;in number theory.</p>
<p>â€œSo much of math can be encoded as a question of, â€˜Does this Turing machine halt or not?â€™â€� Aaronson said. â€œIf you knew all the busy beaver numbers, then you could settle all of those questions.â€�</p>
<p>More recently, Aaronson has used a busy-beaver-derived yardstick to gauge what he calls â€œthe threshold of unknowabilityâ€� for entire systems of mathematics. GÃ¶delâ€™s famous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-incompleteness-theorems-work-20200714/" target="_blank">incompleteness theorems</a>&nbsp;of 1931 proved that any set of basic axioms that could serve as a possible logical foundation for mathematics is doomed to one of two fates: Either the axioms will be inconsistent, leading to contradictions (like proving that 0 = 1), or theyâ€™ll be incomplete, unable to prove some true statements about numbers (like the fact that 2 + 2 = 4). The axiomatic system underpinning almost all modern math, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, has its own GÃ¶delian boundaries—and Aaronson wanted to use the busy beaver game to establish where they are.</p>
<p>In 2016, he and his graduate student Adam Yedidia specified a 7,910-rule Turing machine that would only halt if ZF set theory is inconsistent. This means BB(7,910) is a calculation that eludes the axioms of ZF set theory. Those axioms canâ€™t be used to prove that BB(7,910) represents one number instead of another, which is like not being able to prove that 2 + 2 = 4 instead of 5.</p>
<p>Oâ€™Rear subsequently devised a much simpler 748-rule machine that halts if ZF is inconsistent—essentially moving the threshold of unknowability closer, from BB(7,910) to BB(748). â€œThat is a kind of a dramatic thing, that the number [of rules] is not completely ridiculous,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://math.osu.edu/people/friedman.8" target="_blank">Harvey Friedman</a>, a mathematical …</p></article></div>

So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>While I'm away on my honeymoon, here's my complete talk from PAX Australia 2019, on the rise and fall of legendary shareware publisher Ambrosia Software.</p><p>For Mac gamers in the 90s, the people of Ambrosia Software were rockstars. Heroes. And with brilliant games like Maelstrom, Escape Velocity, Harry the Handsome Executive, Apeiron, and more, plus a company newsletter that spoke directly to the fans, they could do no wrong. In light of Ambrosia's recent closure (finally!), Secret History of Mac Gaming author Richard Moss recounts the studio's high and lowpoints and tells the stories behind its best games.</p><p>Thanks as always to my supporters on Patreon — especially my $10+ backers Vivek Mohan, Simon Moss, Wade Tregaskis, Eric Zocher, and Seth Robinson.

But to tide you by until I'm back, I thought you might enjoy listening to my talk from PAX Australia 2019 about the lesser-known of the indie game publishing giants from before the time of Braid and Steam and all that other stuff we've had over the past 15 years.</p><p>The talk was called The Rise &amp; Fall of Ambrosia Software, '90s Mac Legends, and you can find accompanying slides at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk</a> as well as my full script on the accompanying blog post at lifeandtimes.games. So please, enjoy, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p><div><p><em>[note that this won't correspond exactly to the audio, as it was my written script rather than what I actually said. If you're looking at the slides, "[NEXT]" means go to the next slide.]]<br></em><br>Hello everyone. My name is Richard Moss, and today I'm going to talk to you about a company that's pretty near and dear to my heart, not only as someone who grew up playing some of their games — [NEXT] but also as the author of a book called The Secret History of Mac Gaming, which covers their history, along with lots of other games and game developers from the 1980s and 90s Mac gaming scene. [NEXT]</p><p>If you were a Mac gamer in the late 90s, chances are pretty high that you would have had at least one game in your collection that came from Ambrosia Software. [NEXT] They were heroes among the Macintosh faithful, one of only a few companies that made its games exclusive to the Mac. And arguably the best among them in terms of the quality of its output.</p><p>Games like [NEXT] Maelstrom, [NEXT] Escape Velocity, [NEXT] Ferazel's Wand, [NEXT] Apeiron, and [NEXT] Bubble Trouble were hallmarks of quality, even if most of them were essentially just jazzed-up versions of classic 80s games. And they had top-drawer offbeat gaming options, too, with titles like [NEXT] Avara, a kinda abstract-looking arena-style first-person shooter, and [NEXT] Harry the Handsome Executive, where you guide a middle management executive through an office electronics apocalypse while scooting around in a swivel chair.</p><p>For about 15 years or so, from 1993 to around 2008, the Ambrosia Software name was inseparable from quality Macintosh games. But then it faded rapidly into the background, for reasons I'll get to later, and finally the company closed its doors at the end of last year.</p><p>***</p><p>So in recognition of Ambrosia's achievements, which have slipped a bit under the radar outside of the old-school Mac faithful, I wanted to give you a tour through the company's rise and fall. </p><p>There's not enough time to cover everything, but I'll try to get to all the key stuff and you'll hopefully come away with a good sense of a) why Ambrosia Software matters to the history of computer games and b) what made Ambrosia special to the Macintosh flock. </p><p>I've got some interview clips, a bit of gameplay footage, some photos and old documents to help us along the way. I wanted to set up an emulator as well but just ran out of time unfortunately. And hopefully there'll be plenty of time at the end for questions and stories from you in the audience.</p><p>But before we go into rise and fall of Ambrosia, let's do some quick background. First, on Ambrosia founder Andrew Welch. Then second on the Mac gaming scene in the early 90s.</p><p>[NEXT] So, Andrew Welch. His dad owned a marketing company, and it was through that business that young Andrew planted the seed for what would become Ambrosia. When he was something like 12 or 13 years old, he found the company's library of books and documents on typography. He thought it was cool, so he learnt how to design his own typefaces on his Macintosh. Then, starting from age 14 or so, he sold them on America OnLine.</p><p>But most people doing this sold their fonts without any documentation at all, so there was no way to know after the fact who made it, how to pay for it, who to contact for support, and so on. So Andrew taught himself how to code a utility program that could wrap his fonts in a simple document reader thing.</p><p>He enjoyed coding so much that he kept doing it, and made various other utilities for his relatives. Then he went off to college to study photojournalism and in his spare time he created [NEXT] his first game, a Wheel of Fortune clone called Wacky Wheel.</p><p>[NEXT] [show it in action]</p><p>This was kind of par for the course with small Mac games at the time. There were lots of people putting out crappy little games as freeware or shareware, but even the rare good ones weren't really making anything more than pizza and beer money.</p><p>[NEXT] Or literally beer.</p><p>Quick definition of shareware: [NEXT] it's software that you give away, free, but you ask that if someone likes it they pay you a registration fee — which, depending on the exact implementation, might get that person customer support or free updates or maybe just remove the nag screen from the boot-up process.</p><p>[NEXT] This is a pretty typical shareware notice, taken from an early DOS game.</p><p>Over on the PC side, shareware had already taken off. [NEXT] Apogee Software and Epic MegaGames were making a fortune working with independent developers and selling their games in a clever twist of the standard shareware model called The Apogee Model. Instead of giving away the whole thing for free and requesting that people pay if they like it, Apogee and Epic's games were [NEXT] episodic — episode one distributed freely over the internet and BBSs and through mail-order floppy disks, and all subsequent episodes available to order for a set fee.</p><p>I'm actually writing a book about this stuff, so if you're curious to learn more ask me about it later.</p><p>And id Software were just starting to make their name at this point as well. [NEXT] Wolfenstein 3D dropped in 92, then [NEXT] Doom in 93, both published as shareware on PC through Apogee. </p><p>So the time was ripe for shareware to step up and hit the big time on the Mac side, too. The Mac was at the peak of its [NEXT] pre-iMac popularity. College kids across the United States had Macs set up in their dorm rooms, while creative professionals all around the world had taken up the Mac mantle and were keen for more time-wasters to get them through the lulls in their output.</p><p>But there weren't many games coming out — the porting industry, which took PC games and put them on Mac, was still in its infancy after struggling with the [NEXT] peculiarities of adapting games for the Mac's multi-window mouse and menu-driven interface. Truly cross-platform commercial computer games that had concurrent Mac and PC releases were still rare (though there were a few special ones like [NEXT] SimCity 2000), and Mac-first development had gone into a bit of a lull (for a variety of reasons) at the end of the 1980s — from which it had yet to fully recover.</p><p>So there was lots of room for a great new Mac-native game to stand out.</p><p>And, crucially for our story here, someone was wrong on the Internet. I'll let you hear this bit straight from Andrew: [NEXT]</p><p><em>AW: I think it was the summer after maybe my freshman year of college that someone had said — I think it was called the Mac IIci or something like that. It was one of the colour Macs that came out. And someone had said something about the fact that while it was too slow to do decent animation on — and by that point in time I had actually taught myself for Assembly language, as well. So I set out to prove this guy wrong, because it's always fun to try to prove someone on the Internet that they're wrong. <p>*laughs* So, yeah, so that's how I started writing — and I really wasn't sure what I was going to do yet — but I started writing some kind of animation stuff. I grew up going to a lot of the arcades where we played games like Asteroids and Centipede and that type of thing where after school I would get dropped off there and play. So I decided to make an Asteroids-based game.</p></em></p><p>[NEXT]<br>He asked a couple of friends to help him out with the graphics, and got together with a few of his college buddies and a microphone to make a bunch of silly noises and record stuff off the TV for sound effects.</p><p>They pulled liberally from pop culture, drawing tiny clips and references (without permission) from all over the place, kind of like the wall of sound that early hip-hop and remix culture had.[NEXT]</p><p>He called the game Maelstrom and put it online as shareware, published under the name Ambrosia Software — a name he pulled from Greek mythology. You could play it and share it freely, but it'd nag you to send in a cheque to register every time you booted the game. And a lot of people did. [NEXT]</p><p><em>everyday we would go to the mailbox and there'd be letters from all over the world. I just had a blast. I thought it was really really cool that I could do something just sitting in my room in upstate New York, which was where I was at the time. And I got these contacts from all over the world. I thought that was really really cool, and it was at a time where people were just starting to get connected online.<p>Like now it's no big deal — you can go on …</p></em></p></div></div>

<p>This is the second part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, III, IV) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> / <em>Game of Thrones</em> series.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  Our last part, “<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">Barbarian Couture</a>” looked at the influences that shaped the visual depiction of the Dothraki and found them badly wanting, more based in stereotypes and misconceptions than historical reality.</p>



<p>This week, we’re turning to the foundation of social structures: <strong>patterns of subsistence</strong> (<strong>which, to be clear, means in plain English: “how do they get food and basic resources?” </strong> That’s all subsistence is – how do you get enough resources to survive.)  Originally this was going to fit into a larger argument about culture, but I decided to break it out because we are <em>at long last</em> looking at the logistics and subsistence strategies of nomadic peoples.  Every time we have covered the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/">logistics </a>of <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">agrarian </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/10/04/collections-the-preposterous-logistics-of-the-loot-train-battle-game-of-thrones-s7e4/">armies </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">societies</a>, there has been a request to do a deeper dive into the way that Steppe nomads in particular, and nomads more generally, are different.  <strong>Well here it is!</strong></p>

<p>(Bibliography note before we dive in.  I am not going to run through everything I’ve glanced at here, but for those looking to read more on this or retrace my steps more generally, a good starting place on the Steppe peoples is T. May, <em>The Mongol Art of War</em> (2007).  There’s also more than a dash here of bits from K. Chase, <em>Firearms: A Global History to 1700</em> (2008) as well as T. Ratchnevsky, <em>Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy</em>, trans. T.N Haining (1991).  For the Native Americans of the Great Plains, I have relied principally on A.R. McGinnis, <em>Counting Coup and Cutting Horses: Intertribal Warfare on the Northern Plains, 1738-1889</em> (1990), F.R. Secoy, <em>Changing Military Patterns of the Great Plains Indians (17th Century through Early 19th Century)</em> (1958), and A.C. Isenberg, <em>The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920</em> (2020))</p>



<p><strong>As with the past essay, the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).  Last time, we found that the <em>appearance</em> of the Dothraki fit almost entirely within the ‘dash’ of fantasy.  So this time we will begin to ask the same question about Dothraki culture –<strong> to what degree may it be said to be based in any <em>actual</em> historical horse-nomad cultures?</strong></p>



<h2>A Feast For People</h2>



<p>Now ‘culture’ is such a huge topic, it may well be asked why start with subsistence strategies. <strong> The answer is that in the pre-modern world, subsistence was one of, if not the, most dominant factor shaping culture</strong>.  After all, most people before the industrial revolution spent most of their time just doing the basic activities (herding, farming, spinning, weaving, cooking, etc.) that made survival possible!  Government structures, military organization, cultural values, marriage and fertility patterns, social structures all flow out of those things which most people were doing to survive, shaped by the needs of those subsistence strategies.</p>



<p>(A brief pedantic note: this sort of approach to history, beginning with big, slow changing patterns (what I often call here ‘structures’ – not a term I made up, by any means) like climate, geography, subsistence strategies, culture, etc. is generally associated with what is called the <em>Annales</em> school of history, which is a <em>method</em> of history.  This framework is often more interested in <em>La longue durée</em> (lit: ‘the (really) long term’) which is just a fancy French way of saying ‘a focus on the long-term historical structures (like those listed above) instead of short-term events (like wars, rulers, that sort of thing).’  As always, this sort of historical theory is a toolbox, not a dogma; different approaches to answer different questions.  But in this case, it is handy because of the way that the basic activities necessary for survival in a given climate form a sort of ‘bounding box’ for cultural possibility.)</p>



<p>What is particularly notable is with <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that our viewpoint character for Dothraki culture is a young woman who spends her time with the Dothraki in the <em>khalassar’s</em> (the Dothraki word for a tribe or clan) moving encampment.  Daenerys can only really view warfare second hand (at least in the books we get; the show is another matter), <strong>but she ought to be able to witnesses the subsistence system directly</strong>.  Even if she wasn’t involved in it directly (because she’s a high status queen), the daily work of survival would be going on all around her and in practice much of it would likely be at her direction as she exercises authority over lower-status individuals in the camp.</p>



<p>Now normally we would start this by looking at how subsistence strategies are represented in the books and show, but I think in this case it is going to be more helpful to begin with the historical subsistence systems <em>first</em>, since they are complex and we’re going to have several of them.  We’re actually going to start at the ending as well, with subsistence strategies of Native Americans on the Great Plains, for reasons that will be clearer once we’ve discussed it.</p>



<h2>A Changing of Patterns</h2>



<p><strong>The domesticated horse is not native to the Americas</strong>.  There is perhaps no more important fact when trying to understand how the horse-borne nomadic cultures of the Eurasian Steppe relate to those of the Great Plains.  The first domesticated horses arrived in the Americans with European explorer/conquerors and the settler-colonists that followed them.  Eventually enough of those horses escaped to create a self-reproducing wild (technically feral, since they were once domesticated) horse population, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang">mustangs</a>, but they are not indigenous and mustangs were never really the primary source of new horses the way that wild horses on the Steppe were (before someone goes full nerd in the comments, yes I am aware that there were some early equines in the Americas at very early dates, but they were extinct before there was any chance for them to be domesticated).</p>

Mustangs are descendants mostly of Spanish horse breeds.  Notably, they tend to be smaller than many other breeds of European horses, even in cases where their domesticated forebears were larger breeds of draft horses or destriers.  This is because big stable-fed horses can’t survive on grass alone.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Horses arrived in the Great Plains form the south via the Spanish and moving through Native American peoples west of the Rocky Mountains by both trade and eventually raiding in the early 1700s</strong>.  Notably firearms <em>also</em> began moving into the region in the same period, but from the opposite direction, coming from British and French traders to the North and West (the Spanish had regulations against trading firearms to Native Americans, making them unavailable as a source).  Both were thus initially <em>expensive trade goods</em> which could only be obtained from outside and then percolated unevenly through the territory; unlike firearms, which remained wholly external in their supply, horses were bred on the plains, but raiding and trade were still essential sources of supply for most peoples on the plains.  We’ll get to this more when we talk about warfare (where we’ll get into the four different military systems created by this diffusion), but being in a position where one’s neighbors had either the horse or the gun and your tribe did not was an <em>extreme</em> military disadvantage and it’s clear that the ‘falling out’ period whereby these two military innovations distributed over the area was very disruptive.</p>



<p><strong>But unlike guns</strong>, which seem to have had massive military impacts but only minimal subsistence impacts (a bow being just as good for hunting bison as a musket, generally), <strong>the arrival of the horse had <em>massive</em> subsistence impacts</strong> because it made hunting <em>wildly</em> more effective.  But the key thing to remember here is: the horse was <em>introduced</em> to the Great Plains no earlier than 1700, horse availability expanded only slowly over the area, but by 1877 (with the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_War_of_1876">Black Hills War</a>), true Native American independence on the Great Plains was functionally over.  <strong>Consequently, unlike the Steppe, where we have a fairly ‘set’ system that had already been refined for centuries, <em>all</em> we see of the Plains Native American horse-based subsistence system is rapid change</strong>.  There was no finally reached stable end state, as far as I can tell.</p>



<p>Though there is considerable variation and also severe limits to the evidence, it seems that prior to the arrival of the horse, most Native peoples around the Great Plains practiced two major subsistence systems: <strong>nomadic hunter-gathering on foot </strong>(distinct from what will follow in that it places much more emphasis on the gathering part)<strong> on the one hand and a mixed subsistence system of small-scale farming mixed seasonally with plains hunting seems to have been the main options pre-horse</strong>, based on the degree to which the local area permitted farming in this way (for more on those, note Isenberg, <em>op. cit.</em>, 31-40).

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis. That’s changed thanks to Therapsil. A couple months ago, he became the first Canadian to legally use psychedelic mushrooms to treat end of life anxiety and depression. Take a listen to his story with an open mind.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:02:33</span></span></span><span><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/microdosing-pschedelics-study-1.4771647" data-contentid="" flag="" text="How and why people 'microdose' tiny hits of psychedelic drugs"><span>How and why people 'microdose' tiny hits of psychedelic drugs</span></a></li></ul></span></p>  <p>The move comes after Health Canada&nbsp;gave <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/magic-mushrooms-therapy-1.5675637" target="_blank">four exemptions to palliative care patients</a> to use the drug&nbsp;for end-of-life psychotherapy in August. Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>As was his custom before the drive home from work with his son, the old man walked across the narrow, tenement‐lined street in Manhattan’s Little Italy to buy some fresh fruit. The grocer, who had known him for many years, helped the old man sort out some prize oranges and, as a gift, handed him a perfectly ripened, home‐grown fig. The old man smiled, accepted the backyard offering with a slight nod and started toward his car. It was then that he spotted two gunmen.</p>
<p>He called out to his son and began to sprint toward the safety of his car with surprising speed for a man of his age, but the gunmen were too quick. As they opened fire, the old man seemed caught in a great leap, suspended momentarily in the air, his arms thrown protectively around his head. Loud shots hammered through the street, bright oranges rolled across the gray pavement and the old man crashed onto the fender of his car and collapsed. The people of Mott Street watched in silence from tenement windows, fire escapes and rooftops as the gunmen slipped away. Then, to spontaneous applause, the grim street tableau came to life, and the old man—the godfather, <a href="http://www.thestacksreader.com/brando/">Marlon Brando</a>—lifted himself slowly from the ground, smiled at the cheering crowd and bowed.</p>
<p>At 11 o’clock on April 12, just as Brando was getting shot on Mott Street, Carlo Gambino, one of New York’s real godfathers, sat around the corner in a Grand Street cafe, sipping black coffee from a glass and holding 18th‐century Sicilian court in 20th‐century New York. He had arrived moments earlier in the company of his brother, Paul, and five bodyguards. It was his custom, as well as his duty as head of a Mafia family, to hear at regular intervals the endless woes of racketeers, dishonored fathers and deportable husbands. They were ushered before him, one at a time, from a waiting area in a restaurant across the street. He was the final judge to people still willing to accept his decisions as law.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back on Mott Street, two Mafiosi assigned to observe the movie production were unaware of his arrival. For hours, they had been watching Brando getting shot. They had had innumerable cups of coffee and had adjusted their open‐throat, hand ironed shirts so often that their collars had begun to wilt. Neither of them had been impressed when they heard Brando was to play the godfather, so they watched his performance critically. They volunteered to grips, cameramen and extras that they would have preferred Ernest Borgnine or Anthony Quinn.</p>
<p>“A man of that stature,” one of them said, pointing to Brando, “would never wear a hat like that. They never pinched them in the front like that. Italian block, that’s the way they wore them, Italian block.”</p>
<p>They did not like Brando’s wearing his belt below his trouser loops, either.</p>
<p>“He makes the old man look like an iceman. That’s not right. A man like that had style. He should have a diamond belt buckle. They all had diamond belt buckles. And a diamond ring and tie clasp. Those old bosses loved diamonds. They all wore them. Brando makes the guy look like an iceman.”</p>
<p>In truth, Brando did not look like the traditional double‐breasted, wide lapeled, blue‐serge racketeer. He had accepted the advice of an Italian American friend, rather than the Mafiosi themselves, and made himself look old and bent. He wore a sack shaped suit of an undistinguished brown stripe and an outsize over coat. He wore a cardboard‐stiff white shirt with a collar at least two sizes too large and a striped tie so indifferently knotted that its back, label and all, faced front. The makeup man, who was never very far away, had fixed Brando with an elaborate mouth plate that made his jaw heavy and extended his jowls. Brando’s complexion was sallow, his eyes were made to droop on the side and with his graying temples and mustache many people on Mott Street that day did not recognize him until the filming began.</p>
<h5>There was an aura about the production that was unmistakable, just as there is an aura of real and imagined power around the honored society itself.</h5>
<p>The two Mafiosi did approve the vintage cars and were amused by the streetlamps, pushcarts and prices, circa 1940, tacked up in store windows. But they did not like the way the godfather’s assassins fired their guns.</p>
<p>“They hold pieces like flowers,” one said.</p>
<p>Shortly before noon a third man came up behind the pair and whispered:</p>
<p>“The old man’s around the corner.” The two men were stunned. “You kidding?” one asked. “Believe me, he’s around the corner.”</p>
<p>“Kee‐rist!”</p>
<p>“Shooo!”</p>
<p>Without further hesitation—and with the same pitch of excitement most neighborhood people saved for a peek at Brando—the trio left the movie set. They walked quickly toward the intersection and stopped. One of them darted his head around the corner of the building for a quick peek and shot back to his friends: “He’s there. He’s there. I see his car. I see Paul’s guy.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Mario Puzo’s best seller may have started out to be just another multimillion‐dollar movie for Paramount, but it wasn’t long before its producers realized that to the Mafiosi themselves the making of <em>The Godfather</em> was like the filming of a home movie. Before Puzo’s book, cops‐and‐robbers novels and films about organized crime left the mobsters cold. <em>The Godfather</em> was different. When it was published in 1969 word quickly spread across the country’s most regularly tapped telephone wires about this different book on the “honored society.” It was their <em>Forsyte Saga</em>. It was filled with bits of underworld gossip and its characters could be compared to live dons, singers, movie moguls and hit men. It depicted not only their lives, but the lives of their children, wives, enemies and friends. It emphasized their peculiar code of honor rather than their seedy, greedy little maneuverings. It dealt with their strong sense of family and their passionate loyalties. It romanticized and exaggerated their political power, wealth and influence in legitimate business. But most important, it humanized rather than condemned them.</p>
<p>The godfather himself, for instance, was shot because he refused to deal in the dirty business of narcotics. Sonny Corleone, his impetuous heir, was killed in an ambush because he tried to save his pregnant sister from a brutal husband. Michael Carleone, the godfather’s college educated war‐hero son, assumed his father’s Mafia mantle not out of greed, but from a sense of responsibility to his father, who, for all his illegal activities, was a far more honorable man than all the crooked cops, venal judges, corrupt politicians and perverted businessmen who peppered the plot.</p>
<p>Though certain Italian‐American politicians and organizations condemned Puzo for defaming all Italians, the author heard no such criticism from the society about which he had written. In fact, shortly after his book’s publication, Puzo found that some Mafiosi were anxious to meet him. They wanted to compare notes with the author of <em>The Godfather.</em> They, like other fans, refused to believe that the book was all fiction. In Las Vegas he found that a gambling debt he had run up was somehow marked paid. When Puzo protested he was told, “It’s a certain party’s pleasure.” On other occasions, bottles of champagne would arrive at his table unordered. Multisyllabic names were whispered in his ear by reverential headwaiters, and men with sunglasses and diamond rings waved at him across darkened restaurants.</p>
<hr>
<p>Six weeks before the Mott Street shooting of Brando, Albert Ruddy, the film’s producer, was uncertain whether he would be able to make the movie at all. Paramount had been deluged with letters describing the project as anti‐Italian and threatening demonstrations, boycotts and wildcat strikes by everyone from maintenance men to electricians. Letters had come from Congressmen in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, as well as from dozens of New York State legislators, judges, civic leaders and businessmen.</p>
<p>One of them began: “A book like <em>The Godfather</em> leaves one with the sickening feeling that a great deal of effort and labor to eliminate a false image concerning Americans of Italian descent and also an ethnic connotation to organized crime has been wasted …. There are so many careers and biographies that could be made into constructive and intellient movies, such as the life of Enrico Fermi, the great scientist; Mother Cabrini; Colonel Ceslona, a hero of the Civil War; Garibaldi, the great Italian who unified Italy; William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Guglielmo Marconi, and many, many others.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by “the Grand Venerable of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of New York State’s Sons of Italy.” It also informed Paramount that the studio could expect an economic boycott of the film, petitions of protest from all Sons of Italy lodges, regional meetings to plan protests, a complaint filed with the State Human Rights Division and demands that no governmental authorities give the production any cooperation whatever.</p>
<p>And as if this were not enough, there were rumors of union walkouts, work stoppages and boycotts. Ruddy could envision costly delays. He had already run into trouble trying to negotiate with householders in Manhasset, L.I., for a site that looked like a godfather’s compound. The entire community and its bureaucrats had ganged up to sabotage his efforts.</p>
<p>“First, they’d complain that we would bring additional cars into the area and take up parking space,” Ruddy said. “So we’d promise to bus our people to the locations. Then they’d say they didn’t want buses in the area. Some said that if we did use their homes for the mall and the wedding the newspapers couldn’t know about it. How could we guarantee that? We were ready to pay, rent, replant, repaint, replace everything in the area for them. We were ready to make all kinds of concessions, but in the end I realized that they just didn’t want us. They never flat came out and said no, but it amounted to the same thing.</p>

                  <div>
        <p>“She’s away on vacation for two weeks,” said Bobby, manager of the village of Quaqtaq.</p>
<p>He was talking about the head of the recreation department, who had all of the keys, most importantly the one for the Isummasarvik School’s storage room. We needed it to get the sports equipment to keep the kids occupied at day camp: balls, badminton racquets, nets, and hockey sticks.</p>
<p>I sighed inwardly. Ever since I’d been working in Nunavik, finding a key had been a recurring nightmare. I had already given up hope.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could ask the caretaker,” Bobby suggested.</p>
<p>Anne, my colleague, nodded and waved me on. We got back into the truck. On the other side of the windows, the June sun was beating down on the frozen bay that it could not crack. We stopped in front of a house near the footbridge spanning the river. The caretaker was out, but her husband exchanged a few words with Anne in Inuttitut, then disappeared and returned with the miraculous key. I pinched myself. It had taken all of five minutes.</p>
<p>That was back in 2015, my fifth summer in Nunavik. If it had happened a few years earlier, I would have probably told the story on my blog, joking about how even a simple task can be so immensely complicated in the North.</p>
<p>But as the old man held out the keys, it hit me: it was my fault that it was complicated. I had begun setting up day camps in the North in 2011. Everything that I had found difficult then was difficult because I was trying to make things work my way: planning activities and appointments in advance, holding daily meetings, requiring long-term commitment from the camp’s employees. There was another problem too: I didn’t know the people or the language well enough. I didn’t know who the caretaker was or where she lived. I wouldn’t have been able to speak with her husband, who spoke only in Inuttitut.</p>

      </div>

      </div>

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>I’d learned a few words, of course, especially words useful for working with children: <em>come here, sit down, do you understand, hurry up, are you ready, stop, wait, again, a little, a lot, yesterday, today, tomorrow, yes, no, maybe, what’s your name, and how old are you.</em> We’d played Twister once, so I also knew the names of body parts, colours, left and right. I knew the names of all the animals. It was a start, but not enough to converse with the caretaker’s husband.</p>
<p>Many of the <em>Qallunaat</em> (whites) I met among the Inuit described Inuttitut as “impossible to learn.” It did indeed seem complicated, with all those qs, ks, and js, but I loved its rough sonority. Moreover, I could never feel at ease with this linguistic one-sidedness. Some of my friends were taking online courses with Professor Marc-Antoine Mahieu at INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales), affiliated with the Sorbonne in Paris. They all spoke about the class with the same blissful smile. In 2016 I signed up too. I had just quit my job to devote myself to writing. It meant that I would no longer be travelling to Nunavik but that I had more time—and I very much wanted to learn Inuttitut and keep a foot in the North.</p>
<p>In our first class, Marc-Antoine made a point of destroying our hopes. Inuttitut is a highly unfamiliar language, not nearly as easily learned as English or Spanish. Acquiring competence would take years of study and practice, and despite all that effort, we would very likely never be able to really converse.</p>
<p>Strangely, this bleak prospect soon seemed irrelevant. Little by little, I discovered a spectacular language, immensely creative and full of humour. A language that had to invent all sorts of slightly eccentric ways of naming the elements of modern life, but that described the land and hunting techniques with staggering precision. A language that seemed made for poetry with its constructed words and love of repetition; a language that taught me so many things about people that I’d been among for years without ever really knowing.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
        

      
    
      

                  <div>
        






<p>Don’t believe everything you’ve heard, however: there are not hundreds of words for snow.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>

            <p><img src="https://content.beside.media/beside_/app/www/2020/10/B09_Nuna_Alexis-Hobbs-06.jpg" alt="">

          </div>

      </div>

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>Over and over, I’d said what so many others have: that the Inuit have a very liberal concept of time. I learned that it could be as structured as my own; it was just structured around other things. For example, the months are defined by animal behaviours.</p>
<p>September, October, November: <em>amiraijaut, arnalirnguutivik, natjuijarvik.</em></p>
<p>Time when antlers lose their velvet. Time when the males compete for females. Time when caribou shed their antlers.</p>
<p>Places that I had known by their French or English names regained their original appellations: I now dared to utter the word <em>Kangiqsualujjuaq</em>; I no longer needed to say <em>George River</em>. I was unlearning my geography, just as so many Indigenous people have had to unlearn theirs. Even the idea of “the Arctic” once hadn’t existed for the Inuit. They had to invent a word for it that suited a Western geographical perspective: <em>Ukiurtatuq</em>, which translates as “repeated winter.”</p>
<p>I found that the language had a harmonious relationship with the environment—despite the occasionally ruthless climate. In the very first Inuttitut dictionary, written by Taamusi Qumaq in 1991, Nunavik is defined as “a large country occupied by animals.” I admired this humility, this awareness that a place is shared with other species, that one is living, in a way, on <em>their</em>&nbsp; land.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>
        <figure>
                      <img src="https://content.beside.media/beside_/app/www/2020/10/AWH_2318.jpg" alt="">
                            </figure>
       </div>

              
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>It’s perhaps precisely because of this humility that one should never speak ill of <em>sila</em>, the weather. This was a blessing for a snow lover like me, tired of the eternal whinging about winter.</p>
<p>All of these words for different kinds of snow and ice, for Northern hunting and fishing techniques, show the extent to which the Inuit were at one with their land. Some people have bandied about the idea that the ancestors of the <em>Nunavimmiut</em>&nbsp; found themselves stuck in the North, blocked from going south by the Cree in the west and Innus in the east, but this is false. Research has concluded that the ancient peoples of the Arctic in fact moved even further north during a period of warming around the year 1000, because they did not know how to survive without the cold. Today, climate change has had particularly devastating consequences for the populations of Nunavik and Nunavut.</p>
<p>In the land that would become Canada, European explorers (<em>tariup akiani</em>, “from across the sea”) saw a vast reservoir of natural resources for exploitation. Our current climate crisis is the direct result of this unbridled exploitation, our stubborn insistence on doing things our way, our belief that we can draw a hermetic border between us and <em>nuna</em>, the great land, when in fact we live in each other.</p>
<p>Our language navigates modern urbanity with much more ease than Inuttitut, but it reflects a far more distant relationship with the environment, often stuck in the idea of fighting against the elements. Could the rich vocabulary of the Inuit inspire us to redefine our relationship with nature? <span>■</span></p>

a single feed using a bandit algorithm. If you've subscribed to three
feeds—A, B and C—Findka will start out picking articles from the
feeds uniformly. 1/3 of the articles will come from feed A, etc. As time goes
on, Findka will adjust the distribution based on your usage data. If you never
click on articles from feed A and you always click on articles from feed B,

We’ve created </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>a starter repository</em></a><em> to show these concepts in PostgreSQL and MySQL </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>on Github</em></a><em> if you’d like to dig in immediately while reviewing our process below.</em></p><p>Containers are a valuable resource for us developers. They give you the ability to package your production code, dependencies, and assets into a standardized unit. Once conveniently packaged, running your application in a variety of environments is a breeze. And yet despite containerization’s immense value, we often see teams overlook containers entirely when it comes to managing test databases. At Tonic, whether we’re helping our customers improve testing with high-quality test databases or building our own testing environments, we rely on Docker as a key part of the pipeline. Our customers are finding a lot of value in the approach, so we thought we’d share our strategy.</p><h2>The Trouble With Test Databases</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the typical growth of a test database for a team:</p><ol role="list"><li>You and your team realize that testing in production is a bad idea. You’ve heard about it or you’ve felt the pain yourself: mistakes that lead to data loss and time spent restoring from backups; poor reliability in production due to increased database load; the security team raising their eyebrows at giving too many people access to sensitive data; and the omnipresent anxiety that testing might take down production.</li><li>You decide you need data that’s similar to your production environment, so you write some scripts to generate some fake data (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/how-to-generate-simple-test-data-with-faker" target="_blank"> faker</a>), use some free or paid services to generate some random data for you (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/tonic-mockaroo" target="_blank"> Mockaroo</a>), or extract data from production and attempt to anonymize it later (dealing with the mess of maintaining referential integrity).</li><li>You shove either those scripts or data files into your code repo.</li><li>You write in a README the loader command to get it into your database of choice, and like a rite of passage, everyone on the team struggles through getting it to work during onboarding.</li></ol><p>And struggle you will! Databases are notorious for requiring large installations with a multitude of dependencies, navigating arcane configuration, and the extensive work of establishing the test dataset: creating schemas, creating tables, and finally loading your generated data.</p><p>Many teams will have a separate installation process for each operating system their developers use, each of which usually takes a good bit of trial and error after poring over database documentation. Others will set up a staging or test server for their team to use, but it risks becoming out-dated without a regular rebuild, it means a lot of coordination between team members, and there is rarely a one-size-fits-all test environment. For example, when you want to test the scale of your application, your entire team is saddled with a giant database that slows everyone down; likewise, too small of a database can limit effective testing for certain projects.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if there were a tool that made it easy to package a database, its dependencies, loader scripts, and its data for any operating system? That any team member could use to easily test their code against a test environment, be it on their local machine or on a quickly spun-up test server in the cloud?</p><h2>Doing Better with Docker</h2><p>Good news, everyone! There is a better way! The many benefits that Docker provides for shipping your code in production work likewise for testing. You can create a database that is easy to distribute, deploy, and reset so that individuals and teams can work effectively without stepping on each other’s toes. For larger organizations, you can even package multiple test databases that each contain different tables or amounts of data, easily available to everyone in your engineering org. Best of all, you don’t need a different local installation README for each operating system—developers can just use the OS they feel most productive in without the headaches of the past.</p><h3>The Basics</h3><p>The simplest way to get started is to use a vanilla database image for your database of choice. By using docker-compose, you can set up the configuration once, and it’s just a<tt> docker-compose up -d </tt>to start the database. Here’s a basic configuration below:</p><h5>version: '3'<br>services:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testdb_postgres:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image: postgres:12<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart: always<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ports:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 5432:5432<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_USER: user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_DB: test_data<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;container_name: testdb_postgres<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volumes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /tmp:/tmp<br></h5><p>This configuration does the following:</p><div><ul role="“list”">
<li>Creates a container named<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>that runs off of a PostgreSQL 12 image</li>
<li>Opens up Postgres’ default port of 5432 to 5432 on your host machine</li>
<li>Attaches the<tt> /tmp </tt>folder to your host machine’s<tt> /tmp </tt>folder</li>
<li>Creates a new user with credentials<tt> user/password</tt>, and a new database called<tt> testdb_postgres</tt>.</li></ul></div><p>Right off the bat, we’ve removed a lot of work from the README, and if you have data or data-generating scripts in your repo, you’ve made it much easier to get up and running quickly by simply pointing them to load into the database via the host part. Many databases have official images, including <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/" target="_blank">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server" target="_blank">MS SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo" target="_blank">Mongo</a>, among others.</p><h3>Even Better: Packaging Your Data &amp; Scripts with Docker</h3><p>Instead of just using the available database image and calling it a day, you can easily create a new Docker image based off of your database’s official image. Many official images have an entry point folder that allows you to run scripts upon initialization, enabling the container to be immediately useful as soon as it’s up. To do this, you’ll likely need to add a Dockerfile and a build script, and potentially any data import scripts.</p><h4>Dockerfile</h4><p>Making a basic Dockerfile is not hard at all, in fact it’s only two lines:</p><h5>FROM postgres:12<br>COPY sql/*.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/</h5><p>Here we did the following:<br></p><div><ol role="list">
<li>We started by defining a<tt> Dockerfile </tt>with a<tt> FROM </tt>declaration pointing to the base image of your database.</li>
<li>We copied over all of our data import scripts (defined in a subdirectory named sql) to the<tt> /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ </tt>directory. Postgres <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">defines this folder</a> for SQL scripts to be run during initialization.</li>
</ol></div><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">code repository</a>, you’ll see we’ve commented out additional options to consider for your use case, such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Adding any additional dependencies, like database extensions or certificates using typical package manager commands.</li><li>Adding data files to an accessible directory for use with data import scripts.</li><li>Adding custom scripts to import data outside of the container, e.g. via S3 or other data storage.</li></ul><h4>Build Script</h4><p>Here we simply create a shell script to make it easier to build the container. Our build.sh contains the following command which merely tags the new container as<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>and specifies the Dockerfile to use.</p><h5>docker build -f Dockerfile -t testdb_postgres .<br></h5><p>If you were building this in a CI environment, we’d recommend giving the tag a unique version for each build and release as a script argument, such as<tt> testdb_postgres:1.0.4</tt>.</p><h4>SQL Scripts</h4><p>Next, you’ll need to create SQL loader scripts that create your schema and load in your data. Typically the easiest way to do this is by using database dump commands with an existing test database. We recommend three scripts: the first one creates your schema without constraints, the second one loads your data, and the third one adds your constraints to all of your tables. This way, you’re able to load your data without worrying about the order in which it’s loaded (which would matter if foreign key constraints were already in place).</p><p>Some databases will turn off constraints using a data import tool until the import is complete, which means you can just keep your constraints in the schema script. For simplicity, in <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">our example code</a> we only use two scripts since our data script loads tables in order and doesn’t break referential integrity.</p><p>Sticking with PostgreSQL as our example, you can run the following command to get a dump of your existing schema and constraints:</p><h5>pg_dump -U user -s -f 1_schema.sql [YOUR DATABASE NAME];</h5><p>Followed by a similar command to get just the data:<br></p><h5>pg_dump -U user -a -f 2_data.sql test_data;<br></h5><p>Notably, we’ve added numbers to the beginning of each filename to ensure that the schema script is run before the data load script. (Postgres runs the scripts in this folder in alphabetical order.)</p><p>Take a look at our code to see the full output of both of these files. Feel free to modify these files as you like or write them from scratch, especially if you plan to load your data using a COPY or LOAD command.</p><h4>Modifying your docker-compose.yml</h4><p>Lastly, update the image you’re using to the name of your newly tagged one: image: testdb_postgres. If you’re versioning your container when you build it, we recommend specifying a stable release tag such as<tt> testdb_postgres:stable </tt>so that users can pull the latest update to that tag with<tt> docker-compose pull</tt>.</p><h4>Setting up CI</h4><p>Now you can check your Dockerfile, scripts, and data files into a code repo, and create a build for the Docker container in your CI service of choice using your build script. Any time the scripts or data files are changed, we recommend triggering a new release build for the container and pushing it to your container repository for use by your entire team (of course, after you’ve checked that nothing new caused the build to break 😉).</p><p>If everything is set up, it should be as simple as distributing the docker-compose.yml file to your team and running a<tt> docker-compose up</tt>.</p><h2>Next Level Test Data Management</h2><p>If you’ve followed the steps thus far, you’ll likely find that your testing setup is much more reliable and useful to your entire team, and it’s a big leap forward in efficiency.</p><p>From here, there are a lot of ways …</p></div></div>

<p>Most people thought I was crazy for doing this, but I spent the last few months of my gap year working as a short order cook at a family-owned fast-food restaurant. (More on this <a href="https://offlinemark.com/2020/11/12/gap-year-restaurant/">here</a>.) I’m a programmer by trade, so I enjoyed thinking about the restaurant’s systems from a programmer’s point of view. Here’s some thoughts about two such systems.</p>



<h2>Double, triple, and even quadruple fetching</h2>



<p>Human systems, at first glance, can appear broken, but due to subtle human factors, they might actually work just fine.</p>



<p>My best example is the system for taking and fulfilling orders. We never wrote anything down, and would re-ask orders multiples times, including when ringing customers up. (In computer security, this is known as a <a href="https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/kernel/double-fetch/">double fetch</a>.) Not great service and can theoretically let customers lie and pay less. </p>



<p>In practice most customers didn’t mind too much, liars are rare, and we can loosely detect when something seems off with an order.</p>



<p>Writing orders down and asking strictly once seems optimal but has subtle flaws. For one thing, there’s not enough space behind the counter for everyone to walk to the written order, so it requires more internal communication. This will fail during a rush when you’re blocked on order details and coworkers are too busy for questions. <strong>Customers are always idle; coworkers aren’t</strong>.</p>



<p>It can increase confusion if order slips aren’t thrown out when orders are finished and is also logistically (and literally) messy if you have greasy gloves and want to avoid touching a pen, then food. Lastly, many of my coworkers were older and very used to the existing system. <strong>A major transition to a new system would have generated more confusion than it’s worth</strong>.</p>



<h2>Scheduling algorithms for the fry cook</h2>



<p>While I covered a range of duties including the cash register, milkshake machine, and grill, I spent the most time on the deep fryer. I’m delighted to present this overanalysis of life as a fry cook, from a programmer’s point of view.</p>



<p>This is what deep fryers look like (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nachi.org%2Fdeep-fryer-inspection.htm&amp;psig=AOvVaw1D90dsceyn1wmU-KOGAEuy&amp;ust=1605391502547000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCq-sPDgO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">source</a>):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="Deep Fryer" width="360" height="352" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This picture has 2 fryers, each with 2 baskets that can be submerged to sit in the vats of hot oil below. At work, only 1 fryer would be active on any given day which effectively allows 2 items to be fried at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Fry cooks have a lot in common with operating systems in that they are both responsible for scheduling</strong>. Operating systems schedule threads to run on a limited number of cores; fry cooks schedule food to be fried in a limited number of fryers. Different food items have different priorities, and different lengths of time to cook.</p>



<p>French fries, curly fries, and onion rings (collectively, “fries”) are the main menu items from the deep fryer. Each fry order could be large or small (except for rings which were only large) and eat-in or to-go. The job of the fry cook is to:</p>



<ul><li>Accept fry orders from the greeter.</li><li>Allocate portions of fries from the big bags of raw fries</li><li>Cook them in the fryers</li><li>Put them into the appropriate eat-in/to-go container</li><li>Serve them onto the customer’s tray on the counter, or their to-go bag</li></ul>



<p>The goal is to do this with maximum speed and accuracy and without dropping orders. You’ll ideally minimize the number of times you ask customers and coworkers for order details. In addition, there are a few sources of complexity to handle:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: Depending on the greeter, they may forget to specify if it’s eat-in or to-go. You can always ask the customer, but the grill chef will likely ask the same question in a little bit. You might be able to save a customer ask if you can eavesdrop on that interaction.</li><li><strong>Timing requirements</strong>: You need to finish orders by the time the grill chef finishes the burgers/hot dogs, but you shouldn’t finish too early. If you put the fries on the counter way before the burgers are ready, they’ll get cold. This matters less for to-go orders, which you can serve into the bag immediately.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: During a rush, you might receive many orders per minute, while only being able to process 1-2 per minute. Once the greeter relays the order, they forget it, so it’s up to you to remember. And remember: no writing things down.</li><li><span><strong>Waste avoidance</strong>: </span>Sometimes you or another cook will make too many fries. To avoid wasting them, you can use the excess towards a future order by refreshing them with a splash later and adding them to a fresh batch.</li><li><strong>Changing orders</strong>: Customers sometimes change their order after you’ve started cooking (e.g. regular fry to curly fry). Now you have to figure out what to do with the partially cooked portion currently in the fryer.</li><li><strong><strong>Misc items</strong></strong>: In addition to fries, there other items that need to be scheduled for time in the fryer, including chicken patties, bacon, clam strips, and fish fillets. </li></ul>



<p>A few techniques to manage all this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Batching orders together</strong>. If a large and small fry order are in the queue, you can cook them in the same basket at the same time.<ul><li>Some customers request their fries “well done”, meaning cooked extra long. This makes batching more complicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Wait n Splash”</strong>: If a fry order is done cooking far before the rest of the grill items and you don’t have pressing items that need fryer time, you can raise the basket from the oil, but leave the food in it. When the grill items finish, you can quickly splash the food back in the oil to refresh it, then serve it. This will prevent it from getting cold on the counter.</li><li><strong>Inactive fryer baskets</strong>: It can be handy to have extra storage space for cooked food. If you have a “wait n splash” order waiting, but you have more orders to fry, you can use the 2 spare baskets from the inactive fryer to store the waiting order and free up the fryer slot. This is also useful when customers change their order and you need to quickly stash the half cooked portion somewhere and start the adjusted order.</li><li><strong>“The tong dip”</strong>: If both fryers are in use and the grill chef hands you bacon to be urgently cooked, you can hold the bacon in tongs and dip it into one of the submerged baskets. This lets you effectively cook more than 2 things at the same time.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the system I ended up using. When a new order came in, I’d stop whatever I was doing and grab the appropriate container and place it in the corresponding fry bucket. This captures all 3 pieces of information about the order (fry type, size, to-go?) letting me forget it. If I strictly follow this, I can just process the containers in the buckets like a queue. However, I still need to keep a sense of order memorized because the system doesn’t capture global ordering – if I have containers in the fry, curly fry, and onion ring buckets, I can’t tell which order came in first.</p>



<p>I don’t have a solution for this. On a super busy day, this system falls apart and I drop orders. Extreme load like that has only happened a few times and in that case, I just make large batches, forget about syncing up with the grill items, and hope I don’t have too much excess at the end. Generally, the system worked nicely.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s fun to think about human systems, like those in a restaurant, from a programmer’s point of view. A fry cook’s job closely resembles that of an operating system scheduler, complete with optimization points and edge cases. One can try to optimize human systems as if they were computer systems, but it’s critical to understand the subtle human aspects of the system when evaluating improvements.</p>

When New Relic's Founder/CEO, Lew Cirne, first started tinkering around with Pixie and participating in our community, we noticed an alignment in our visions for the future of observability, as well as echoes of New Relic’s developer-centric roots in Pixie. Joining New Relic will provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to reach millions of developers faster by open-sourcing a self-managed version of Pixie in the upcoming months.</p><p>When we started Pixie in 2018, Kubernetes was rapidly gaining traction. We felt that a new approach to observability was needed due to the new, fundamental challenges in observing distributed, ephemeral systems. We founded Pixie in order to provide instant, flexible observability for developers like ourselves who were building applications on Kubernetes.</p><p>However, we knew that the most developer-friendly version of Pixie must be open-source. In a forward-looking move, New Relic is giving us the opportunity to open-source Pixie and focus on providing world-class observability to all developers. The developer community is a core element of New Relic’s vision, and Pixie’s open-source offering will be a key part of that initiative and the primary area of focus for the Pixie team going forward.</p><p>We are so excited to begin working with New Relic on our shared vision for the future of observability. In the coming months, we’ll be jointly committing our roadmap in the following initiatives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixie Core</strong>: An open-source and self-managed version of Pixie which we will release to the CNCF sandbox early next year. As part of the process, we look forward to speaking with you about this at Kubecon-EU on May’21. Due to Pixie’s and New Relic’s commitment to open standards, we also plan to build out integrations with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie By New Relic</strong>: Our current Pixie Community offering will continue as a hosted version of Pixie Core and existing New Relic One customers will soon get instant access to Pixie data with a few clicks. Their existing experiences will be augmented with the metrics, logs, events, and application traces that Pixie automatically provides.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie by New Relic, Enterprise Edition</strong>: Industry-specific solutions for sectors such as Media, Telecommunications, and Government that allow enterprise customers to install Pixie entirely inside production clusters while meeting compliance, data security, support, and performance requirements.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, our journey is just beginning.

He'll ask: "<a href="https://youtu.be/C27RVio2rOs?t=1677">How many of you are using Google Analytics as your primary source of metrics?</a>" But it's a trick question. When the majority of the audience eventually raises their hands, he'll fake a sigh and tell everyone that they're doing it wrong, and that they should instead by relying on an event-based analytics tool.<span></span><span>The linked video is from Startup School, but the same talk is given at YC Core as well.</span></p><p>It's a perennial favorite, but don't let the humor distract you. Michael's got a
good point. Without using an event-based analytics tool, which tracks the interactions your users have with your product, you won't know <em>how</em> your
users are using your product. This is arguably just as important as actually
building out the product. There are a lot of event-based analytics tools out
there, but we think that if you're an early-stage startup, Heap makes the best tradeoffs.</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6fae69c970dbd3257184ea4d909f5d858810bdc/35c24/logos/heap.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">Heap</a></p><p>Highest benefit-to-effort ratio</p><p>Gave us auto-tracking functionality, which we think is an exceptionally good safety net for an early-stage startup with rapidly-changing features and limited engineering resources, although it lacks some of the extensibility and more advanced analysis capabilities of its competitors. That said, we think this tradeoff best suits an early-stage startup.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">heap.io</a></p></div></div><summary><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ul><li>"Setting up event-based metrics is something that's super important very early in your company, because it's how you know whether your product is being used or not. And it's the number one source of new product ideas and inspiration." - Michael Seibel</li><li>Google Analytics by itself is insufficient to figure out how your users are using your product, although it is useful to complement an event-based analytics tool.</li><li>Event-based analytics help you figure out what actions a user took on your website.</li><li>We are primarily focused on evaluating the three main event-based analytics tools: Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap.</li><li>We found that event-based analytics is a category of SaaS with some of the most feature parity.</li><li>The core analytics functionality of all three tools is more or less equivalent.</li><li>The key considerations for an early-stage startup are the amount of maintenance and discipline required to maintain useful analytics, and the ability to go far without spending a lot of money.</li><li>We found that defining events in code while having auto-track as a safety net is a near-ideal setup for an early stage startup.</li><li>We recommend Heap, because it is the only major analytics tool that offers this capability. The main downside for an early-stage startup is that you can't get as far on a free plan on Heap compared to Mixpanel or Amplitude.</li><li>If pricing is the main consideration, then we recommend Amplitude. Even though its product is oriented towards later-stage companies, Amplitude has the most generous free plan of the major event-based analytics providers.</li></ul></summary><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="context">Context</h2><h3 id="what-is-event-based-analytics">What is event-based analytics?</h3><p>Pageview-based analytics tools like Google Analytics and event-based analytics tools such as Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap are typically grouped together under the heading of analytics tools. However, we think that lumping them all under the same heading is misleading, because they fundamentally do different things. To better understand what event-based analytics are, we need to understand what exactly Google Analytics does, figure out where its gaps are, and then use that context to motivate event-based analytics tools. </p><p>Google Analytics uses a pageview-driven paradigm, a holdover from what was important in the early 2000s. Its focus on pageviews helps answer questions such as how many users came to your website, what pages they visited, and how they found your website. Unfortunately, it isn't able to help you figure out which specific actions a user performed on any given page of your website. For example, it doesn't answer whether a user clicked on a CTA button, if they abandoned their cart, how far they got into signing up, or what part of the page they were looking at before they converted. Answering these kinds of questions can be quite informative to early-stage startups' decision-making, and can be accomplished quite easily by using an event-based analytics tool.</p><p>An event-based tool will provide two things: an interface to collect "events", and an interface to analyze those events. You can define and implement your events (commonly referred to as instrumenting) by calling the API of the event-based analytics tool you're using.</p><p>To illustrate, let's say you run an ecommerce store. You want to figure out what types of items people checkout without hesitation, and what types of items often result in abandoned carts. This isn't something that can be accomplished with pageview-based analytics tools such as Google Analytics. However, this can be performed quite easily with an event-based analytics tool. If you track two events — when someone adds something to their cart, and when someone checks out their cart — you can figure out which SKUs lead to a high checkout rate, and which SKUs lead to abandoned carts. This is implemented by calling two functions: </p><ol><li><p>a function <code>track('add-to-cart', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code>, including metadata about the item added (e.g. SKU, name, price) in your code that executes when someone adds something to cart, and </p></li><li><p>a similar function <code>track('checkout', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code> in your code that runs when someone checkouts. Data from these events will be sent to your analytics provider, which will provide an interface to analyze and draw conclusions from your data.</p></li></ol><p>This is a simple example, but is already quite a powerful tool to understand your users, and can be easily extended. The same power generalizes beyond an ecommerce store to any startup's web product, helping one answer essential questions such as: Is your CTA convincing? What are the characteristics of products that customers are the most hesitant about buying? What part of the signup process needs to be improved to prevent potential users from dropping off? Which portion of your product page was the most engaging and persuaded customers to take the next step?</p><h3 id="early-stage-startups-and-their-analytics-dilemma">Early-stage startups and their analytics dilemma</h3><p>If event-based analytics are so important for early-stage startups, one might rightly wonder why so many YC startups, whose founders are quite sharp in aggregate, rely primarily on Google Analytics?</p><p>It turns out that this is a rather illuminating question. The main contributor to this phenomenon is easy to understand and empathize with. Startups are busy and overworked, and analytics are often ostensibly seen as orthogonal to the priorities of understanding their users and building product<span></span><span>The <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-essential-startup-advice/">canonical priorities</a> for early-stage startups.</span>. Therefore, event-based analytics often fall to the wayside as they typically require engineering time and discipline to maintain. If you forget to update an event, or don't have time to implement analytics for a new feature, then you can't get any benefit out of it at all.</p><p>Yet, in reality, event-based analytics are one of the best sources of new product insights and inspiration and are a fantastic way to understand how your users are using your product. This is one of our main motivations for writing this particular guide. Early-stage startups have a unique set of challenges to face, particularly around prioritizing their time and engineering resources. That said, we think that there's an approach that can make event-based analytics require a lot less discipline, and therefore make it a lot more attainable for an early-stage startup.</p><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p>Based on a few years of first-hand experience using and testing event-based analytics tools, in addition to aggregating feedback from other founders, we have found the following factors matter most for early-stage startups choosing an analytics tool:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Analytics Functionality</strong> refers to the standard analytics features that are critical for an early-stage startup to understand their users. These include standard analysis tools, such as funnel analysis (i.e. figuring out when users drop out in each step of a process), retention analysis (i.e. figuring out how many users churn, and when), and cohort analysis (i.e. figuring out how different user segments interact with your product). </p></li><li><p><strong>Robustness / Ease of Maintenance:</strong> Early-stage startups need to use analytics just as much as larger companies, but also have to be a lot more resourceful and focused with their time and energy. What happens if you change a component, and don't update the tracking code? What happens if you're under time pressure from a customer and make the conscious decision to launch a complex product without tracking? While large companies have the ability to implement strict QA processes and are okay with extended deadlines, early-stage startups don't have these options. Therefore, we've kept a close eye out for how each analytics tool performs under less-than-ideal situations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Web analytics tools are somewhat notable/notorious for giving generous free plans, attaining lock-in, and then making things more expensive once your company starts becoming successful <span></span><span>This is one of the reasons why <a href="#consider-using-segment-as-a-wrapper">we suggest using Segment</a>, since it helps you avoid vendor lock-in and gives you more negotiating power.</span>. That said, several analytics tools have generous free tiers or deals that can last you quite a long time without paying. Therefore, we've split this criterion into two subcriteria: <strong>How far you can get without paying</strong>, and <strong>Paid Plan Affordability</strong>. The latter is actually somewhat non-trivial to evaluate, because most analytics providers hide their pricing behind a Contact Us gate, even for early-stage startups. That said, we got our hands on a decent amount of data on the actual cost of each service, and we have also compiled a list of typical discounts and deals that you can reasonably expect to get from each analytics provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ease…</strong></p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>During the eight years I spent as an engineering manager, I regularly tracked how I spent my time. As a startup engineering manager, I was responsible for a wide range of duties, so keeping track of which areas I spent the most time on helped me plan and schedule appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, I knew that I typically spent about 1/3rd of my time helping my team solve technical problems or pairing with teammates. Knowing this, I reserved some free blocks of time for them. If my whole week were full of meetings and big-picture planning, I’d become a blocker for my team who needed my input on specific issues.</p>
<p>Since many prospective software engineering managers ask me about my job and what it entails, I decided to create this detailed look at how I spent my time. While every company and role is different, I hope this post gives you some first-hand insight into a day in the life of an engineering manager.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for some books to help you on your journey as a software engineering manager, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some of my favorites</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-does-an-engineering-manager-do">What Does an Engineering Manager Do?</h2>
<p>First, a little bit about my roles as an engineering manager: my first management role was at <a href="https://www.packback.co/">Packback</a>, a question and answer platform for college professors.</p>
<p>I joined the team when there were just four people in the company - it was essentially myself and the founders. In the intervening three years, I saw the company raise close to $5 million and grow to almost 30 people. My engineering team was pretty lean - there were five when I left in 2016 - but my role changed quite a bit over my years with the company.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">I left Packback to join The Graide Network</a>, I started over as an engineering manager. Initially, my team was just a contractor and me, but over my four years at Graide, I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">hired three other engineers</a> and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process">took on more of the product management duties</a>.</p>
<p>While my day-to-day work changed a lot over the years, <strong>as a software engineering manager, I was ultimately responsible for helping my team ship software that worked as expected on schedule and within budget.</strong></p>
<p>The tricky word there is “helping.” What does that mean exactly? Does it mean that an engineering manager writes code? Or do they just make sure everyone on their team is writing code?</p>
<p>The short answer is: it depends.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-must-be-technical">Engineering Managers Must be Technical</h3>
<p>Generally, engineering managers write less code than the senior developers on their team, but <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/do-engineering-managers-need-to-write-code-d89903d68e8d">they should write some code to keep their skills sharp</a>. They also need to be good at helping their team members get “unstuck.” Sometimes this means answering technical questions, and sometimes it means solving disputes between team members.</p>
<p>They’re likely to play a role in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/developing-talent">training new engineers</a> as well as evaluating candidates on a technical and interpersonal basis.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-have-to-be-good-with-people">Engineering Managers Have to be Good with People</h3>
<p>Being “good with people” is a tough label to nail down.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e7ML5PR.gif" alt="I have people skills! - Office Space"></p>
<p>Many people assume that you have to be an extrovert to be an effective manager, <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/are-extroverts-the-best-leaders-maybe-not.html">but that’s not necessarily true</a>. Having empathy for your team and helping them through challenges - both technical and personal - is one of an engineering manager’s primary mandates.</p>
<p>But, engineering managers have to “manage up” as well. This means they need to look out for their team’s best interests when their boss asks them for feedback, and it means they might have to let a team member go if they’re not getting the job done.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardest-part-about-engineering-management">The Hardest Part About Engineering Management</h3>
<p>As I moved into my first management role, the most challenging part was adjusting my method for self-evaluation. Nickolas Means says it well in his <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">fantastic piece on meta productivity for managers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every so often, I have a day where I look up after the last meeting has ended and feel like I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done. I’ve been busy all day long: having conversations, reading documents, and checking in with peers and team members. I’m exhausted, but I’ve accomplished nothing.” - Nickolas Means</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was <em>relatively</em> easy for me to tell how productive I had been as a software engineer. I usually made progress on shipping a feature or opened up a pull request, but as a manager, I had a really hard time telling whether my day was productive or not.</p>
<p>That’s why I started tracking my time. While time spent on a task is not a perfect measurement of productivity, it helped me make sure I was investing enough time into each area of my job.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-engineering-manager-spend-their-time">How Does an Engineering Manager Spend Their Time?</h2>
<p>Engineering managers tend to have a wide range of responsibilities, and these responsibilities vary based on the employer’s size and organizational structure. To help you see how an engineering manager spends their time, I broke my time down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Managerial</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Recruiting</strong> (15%)</li>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong> (15%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, you’ll see how I spent my time as an engineering manager. I’ll offer a little bit about the specific tasks encompassed in each area and why it was an important part of my daily work.</p>
<p>While I tracked my time pretty rigidly for periods of my 8-year management career, I decided to round each category to a nice round number for the sake of simplicity. Exact hours spent on each task aren’t the point here, but I found it helpful to know if one area spiked in one week or dropped sharply in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tx9pTaz.png" alt="engineering-manager-time"></p>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Technical work includes writing code, code reviews, hunting down bugs, pairing with teammates, and reading software updates and best practices. As my teams grew, the amount of time I devoted to writing and reviewing code dwindled, but I do think it’s important for engineering managers to spend at least <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/engineering-managers-should-code-30-of-t/240165174">some of their time elbows deep in the code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="managerial">Managerial</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>This includes direct people management, creating timelines, strategic planning, and meetings with technical and non-technical team members. Making sure my team was happy, advocating for them in business meetings, and helping our product team create technical specs were all part of my engineering manager duties at Packback.</p>
<p>At The Graide Network, I took a more strategic role by consulting with the founders on software choices and jumping in on important sales calls. Interestingly, while the tasks I took on were different, the time breakdown was pretty similar.</p>
<h3 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Recruiting time included going to conferences, meetups, and coding bootcamps, writing blog posts, meeting with job candidates, and evaluating technical screenings.</p>
<p>While I spent more of my time on recruiting when I had an open engineering job, smart engineering managers are <em>always</em> hiring. The best candidates are usually the passive ones who rarely look for a job, so I spent a portion of my time getting in front of them each week.</p>
<h3 id="administrative">Administrative</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Finally, I spent a few hours per week reading and writing emails, answering questions in Slack, random conversations, and “other” day-to-day things to support my team. As the manager, I tried to keep these kinds of distractions away from my engineering team, but I’d schedule time with team members when necessary.</p>
<p>If an engineering manager’s job is to make their team as productive as possible, it stands to reason that most of the administrative work will fall to them.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-engineering-manager">What Makes a Good Engineering Manager?</h2>
<p>I don’t think I can give you <em>everything</em> you need to know about being a good engineering manager in just one blog post (<a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some good books on the topic though</a>), so I’ll just pick the three things that I focus on first.</p>
<h3 id="1-empower-your-team">1. Empower Your Team</h3>
<p>Being a good manager is all about <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/articles/1999/01/successful-engineering-management-7-lessons-learned/">helping others achieve great things</a>.</p>
<p>This means that as a manager, your <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">impact is much less direct</a>, and therefore, you can’t spend all your time heads down in the code. It was frustrating for me to see my weekly accomplishments list shrink, but once I learned to accept that my team was getting more done without my individual contributions, I started to really enjoy the role.</p>
<h3 id="2-overcommunicate">2. Overcommunicate</h3>
<p>Whether your team is working in one room or working <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/managing-remote-engineering">remotely across the world</a>, communication is one of your most crucial roles as a manager. In marketing, there’s an idea that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nagging-repetition-effective-communication-marton-jojarth/">people must hear your message seven times before they internalize it</a>, and I think this applies to team communication as well.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you should repeat everything seven times in the same meeting, but think about reiterating significant changes in one-on-ones, group settings, via email, and in passing. Change is scary, but the more people hear about something, the less scary it tends to be.</p>
<h3 id="3-be-the-source-of-calm">3. Be the Source of Calm</h3>
<p>Finally, as the engineering manager, your role is to “<a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/07/dont-create-chaos.html">vacuum up chaos</a>:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t create or perpetuate drama, divide your team from the rest of the company, or pit team members against each other. Instead, be the one who absorbs uncertainty and stress so your team can get sh** done.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you’re an aspiring engineering manager or you’re just wondering what your boss does all day, I hope this helps you.</p>

<p><span>Even worse, how many times have </span><i><span>you</span></i><span> been the one complaining about a cable provider?</span></p>
<p><span>Complaints about cable companies might sound like cliches. But cable providers aren’t like the DMV or the post office —&nbsp;services that draw a lot of consumer ire but ultimately tend to be doing their best to get their jobs done. On the contrary, cable companies have actually been </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/comcast-biggest-scams-claim-cash/"><span>caught engaging in a lot of shady behaviors</span></a><span> that fully justify their customers’ complaints.</span></p>
<p><span>But what if you want to take your dispute with your cable company further than your watercooler chat? What do you do if you have a legitimate complaint about your cable company that you need resolved? Where do you go if you need help getting justice against a cable company that’s gone beyond just providing an unpleasant customer service experience —&nbsp;but has actually wronged you?</span></p>
<p><span>These are questions that a lot of consumers have, and we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the common reasons people might want to seek justice against their cable companies. Then, we’ll explain, step-by-step, how to file a complaint against a cable company, and point you toward some resources that will be on your side if you need help getting justice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Why Do So Many People Have Complaints About Their Cable Companies?</span></h2>
<p><span>Let’s start at the beginning: Why do so many people complain about cable companies? And, more importantly, are people complaining about just annoyances, or actual injustices?</span></p>
<p><span>The American Consumer Satisfaction Index </span><a href="https://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148&amp;Itemid=213"><span>surveys consumers</span></a><span> and scores industries based on how well they provide satisfactory services at fair prices. Consistently, year after year, the cable TV industry ranks lowest out of the dozens of industries the ACSI tracks.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2020, the cable industry has scored </span><a href="https://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;catid=&amp;Itemid=212&amp;i=Subscription+Television+Service"><span>64 out of 100 points on the ACSI index</span></a><span>, which is actually a 3.2 percent increase over last year. But the industry still has the lowest score in the ACSI rankings, reflecting more dissatisfied customers than ISPs, cell phone providers, online news media, and many other industries that consumers love to complain about. Additionally, this year is the first time since 2016 that the cable industry saw an increase in its ACSI ranking.</span></p>
<p><span>ACSI rankings aren’t even the worst evidence against the cable industry, though.</span></p>
<p><span>News reports reveal that some of what cable companies have been up to goes beyond just bad customer service. For example,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Some AT&amp;T customers found they were </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/att-overcharging-customers-complaints"><span>being charged three times the rate</span></a><span> the company promised them. The situation was so bad, one legal expert called AT&amp;T’s policies “a license to steal.”</span></li>
<li><span>Comcast </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/comcast-biggest-scams-claim-cash"><span>wrongly charged a small business owner $1,800 in cancelation fees</span></a><span>, and then spent </span><i><span>two years</span></i><span> fighting against returning that wronged customer’s money.</span></li>
<li><span>Cox employees were found to be </span><a href="https://wjla.com/features/7-on-your-side/cox-communications-complaints-fake-accounts"><span>creating customer accounts without permission</span></a><span> so they could charge users more.</span></li>
<li><span>Optimum got caught advertising a $99 promotion rate, but </span><a href="https://www.thehour.com/business/article/After-profitable-2017-Altice-USA-hikes-Optimum-12885236.php"><span>actually billed users more than $160 for it</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>DirecTV </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/feds-sue-direct-tv-claim-money"><span>broke its contracts with 33 million customers</span></a><span> by wrongly raising their rates.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These are just some examples of how cable companies have done shady (or even outright illegal) things to their customers. In all these cases (and any others like them), the customers deserve justice. But it can be difficult to figure out how to get it.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to File a Complaint Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>The exact process for filing a complaint might vary from one cable company to the next. For more detailed advice about taking on a specific company, visit our consumer guides.</span></p>
<p><span>But no matter what cable company your dispute is with, there are certain steps you can take to file and escalate your complaint. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<h3><span>Step 1: Contact the Cable Company</span></h3>
<p><span>For anyone who’s suffered through an unproductive customer service call, this probably won’t be welcome news. But any time you have a complaint against a company, before taking it to any outside agencies, you need to try to resolve it with the company itself. This is important, because if you end up escalating your complaint to the FTC, FCC, or a local franchising authority, they’ll expect that you’ve already tried to resolve your dispute with the company directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Some best practices to keep in mind here: Try to address the complaint with your cable company in writing, whenever possible. Email is a great option for this. This ensures that you have a record of exactly what’s said by both parties, and you have proof that you attempted to resolve the complaint directly with the cable company, as well as proof of why that didn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve tried this and your cable company was unable or unwilling to help you reach a resolution, it’s time for step two.</span></p>
<h3><span>Step 2: Find the Right Regulatory Agency</span></h3>
<p><span>If your cable company is unable or unwilling to help you, you can escalate your complaint to a regulatory agency. However, finding the right one can be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>Cable companies are overseen by a number of entities: The Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, public utility commissions, and local franchising authorities are the ones that are likely to be most relevant to any dispute you might have. Here’s where this gets complicated: Each of them has different jurisdiction and can only help with certain issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s who you should contact, depending on your complaint.</span></p>

<h4><span>Local Franchising Authorities</span></h4>
<p><span>Local franchising authorities are government organizations that regulate cable TV service at a municipal, county, or other local level. You can usually find the name of your local franchising authority on your cable bill. If not, you can contact your cable company or your local town or city hall to request that information.</span></p>
<p><span>Local franchising authorities can help you with these issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rates for basic service and equipment, and service charges related to basic cable.</span></li>
<li><span>Rates for cable service tiers, particularly if rates for your cable service have been increased within the past 90 days.</span></li>
<li><span>Customer service problems, like availability of customer service representatives, office hours, timeliness of service visits, and outages.</span></li>
<li><span>Franchise fees.</span></li>
<li><span>Signal quality.</span></li>
<li><span>Use of public or informational channels that are required as part of your cable company’s franchise agreement.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Public Utility Commissions</span></h4>
<p><span>In some states, public utility commissions oversee certain issues related to cable or satellite TV services.</span></p>
<p><span>To find out more about your state’s public utility commission, check the </span><a href="https://www.naruc.org/about-naruc/regulatory-commissions/"><span>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners</span></a><span>. If your state has one, PUCs can help you with these issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rates and programming for stand-alone satellite TV services.</span></li>
<li><span>Rates and programming for stand-alone cable TV services (not including basic tier plans).</span></li>
<li><span>Installation of cable or satellite TV services that are not bundled with other services.</span></li>
<li><span>Burial of phone or cable TV wires.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Federal Communications Commission</span></h4>
<p><span>The FCC is a department of the federal government that exists to regulate businesses and prevent them from taking advantage of or unfairly treating consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a number of ways you can contact the FCC if you have a complaint about a cable company that falls under its jurisdiction. You can visit the </span><a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us"><span>FCC Complaint Center</span></a><span> to file your complaint online or get the right information to mail it, or you can call 1-888-225-5322 for information and general questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC can help with these kinds of complaints:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Equal Opportunity Employment complaints.</span></li>
<li><span>Signal leakage that might affect other spectrum users.</span></li>
<li><span>Cable companies that violate rules about home cable wiring.</span></li>
<li><span>Cable companies that violate commercial limits during kids’ programming.</span></li>
<li><span>Indecency or obscenity on a cable TV program.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Federal Trade Commission</span></h4>
<p><span>And finally, the right entity to receive your complaint might be the FTC, which is another department of the federal government. It has similar goals to the FCC, but oversees different things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also similarly to the FCC, you have a few options for contacting the FTC about your complaint. You can use an </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/"><span>online complaint portal</span></a><span>, or you can reach the agency by phone at 1-877-FTC-HELP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of the types of complaints that would fall under the jurisdiction of the FTC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-guides/false-advertising-and-misleading-marketing/"><span>False advertising</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Deceptive business practices.</span></li>
<li><span>Scams.</span></li>
<li><span>Problems with debt collection.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What to Expect After Filing a Complaint Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>After filing a complaint with any of the entities listed above, you might be wondering what comes next. The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends.</span></p>
<p><span>Regulatory agencies, particularly at the federal level, will typically investigate a company if they receive complaints about it. If they find that the company did, in fact, do something wrong, they may impose fines or other punishments. But typically, a federal agency like the FTC or the FCC </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-guides/getting-your-refund/"><span>won’t help you get a refund</span></a><span>, get charges reversed, or get justice in any other, similar way. For that, you have other resources.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Get Justice Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>If resolving your dispute means getting a refund, a zero balance, other compensation, or some other form of justice, you might feel like you have a long, uphill road to climb.</span></p>
<p><span>Most cable companies have clauses built into their contracts that say you can’t sue them, unless it’s in small claims court. But what you can do is </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/how-it-works/"><span>take advantage of consumer arbitration</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Arbitration works a little bit like small claims: You’ll send a legal demand to your cable company, and then collect any evidence you have and present it to an independent third party, or arbitrator. The arbitrator will hear both sides of the dispute and make a legally binding decision.</span></p>
<p><span>But even that might sound overwhelming. And if you’ve never been through the process of arbitration before, we don’t blame you if you feel intimidated by the paperwork, the process, or just the thought of taking on a big company with major legal resources.</span></p>

          <h2 id="discovering-the-problem">Discovering the Problem</h2><p>Startups are swallowing corporations' markets. This is mainly because corporations struggle with innovation, regardless of how much they use that word in press releases and PPT presentations. About 7 years ago we started <a href="http://www.codelitt.com/">Codelitt</a>, a corporate skunkworks and product incubator company. We build startups for corporations and invest 20% of our time in building products, tools, and <a href="https://github.com/codelittinc">open source projects</a> for the web. </p><p>In the beginning, we didn't set out to discover a specific problem. Put another way, we weren't being purposeful about searching for a problem to solve. This post is half about the problem with corporate innovation and half about our discovery process that led us to where we are today:</p><h2 id="eye-opening">Eye-opening</h2><p>In the beginning of my career I worked for investors in Latin America helping to build and launch startups before later moving to corporate America. Although I'm often critical of corporate culture, it was really eye opening and integral to my career. Really this is one of the best pieces of advice I can give to entrepreneurs looking for problems to solve:</p><blockquote>If you are smart and ambitious but can't find a problem to solve, go work for a large (preferably traditional) corporation. You'll find plenty there.</blockquote><p>Large enterprises succeed <em>in spite</em> of themselves. It really is a wonder that they get anything done at all. I can't speak for every single large company, but I've worked with quite a few. In one way or another they all have systemic issues. This is not to say that startups or more modern tech companies don't have their own issues. We do. But the proof is in the pudding and startups are launching products monthly that will take a huge chunk of traditional companies' markets or even render them completely irrelevant.</p><p>Some large enterprises have realized that their biggest threat isn't another corporate giant, it's some unknown kid building something. In order to compete, they have to create new value, do a little disruption of their own, and start shipping.</p><blockquote>However, traditional companies spend millions in R&amp;D and take several years to come to market.</blockquote><p>So the question is, why are they at such a disadvantage when their seemingly endless budgets should afford them a solid advantage? The answer is that the same tools, systems, and culture that they rely on to manage their large organization don't work for innovation and skunkworks teams.</p><h2 id="decisions-by-consensus">Decisions by Consensus</h2><p>Traditionally the vast majority make decisions by consensus. Note: there is a difference between collaboration and consensus. Collaboration takes different points into account but can still have one decision maker, whereas consensus decision making requires every single person to have input and be onboard. This is crippling to organizations. Teams should have a single decision maker.</p><p>Any startup who has experienced the sales cycle of a large company can attest to this first hand. While many sales people focus on identifying "the decision maker level," this person is rarely the only decision maker and they'll likely have an entire team to convince. When making a sales pitch (even for a $1,000 a month SaaS product) you'll very likely spend time in a room of 12 or so people from different areas of the company. Most of those people will likely have different needs and agendas. The same is true when it comes to developing new products, processes, or strategy. Decision making time is multiplied by an exponential factor.</p><blockquote>In the time it takes a large organization to make a decision just to move forward with something, a startup could have built, launched, and validated a new feature or model.</blockquote><h2 id="corporate-it">Corporate IT</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why normal innovation processes, product prototyping, and building new business models is so costly inside a large organization. Time is a huge factor. A close second is the cost of actual development. As with everything, I'm sure there are reasons for why things are done the way they are done. But from a product development perspective and coming from the startup world, they are nearly impossible to understand.</p><p>Corporate IT departments have a hard time looking at a product as something that develops. They see a project as having a start date, an end date, and a full set of features. There is no iterative development. They plan for every possible scenario and build to the full spec. Version releases begin with 1.0.0 launch and following releases are security patches at best.</p><p>Instead of using open source tools, large IT teams are locked in to Microsoft and Oracle products. I've never been able to understand why this is completely. It could be the fact that they spend a solid chunk of time earning Oracle or Microsoft Certifications. It could be the comfort of having support just a phone call away. Or it could even be an unwillingness to learn something new. </p><p>From a security perspective, it's like looking for a babysitter to watch your kids, asking for her recommendations, and she tells you, "Just trust me. I promise your child is secure. But just so you know, we'll be doing things my way; your house rules don't apply."</p><p>From a time perspective, there are open source technologies that allow you to whip up an MVP in much less time. Even with complaints about Rail's "magic under the hood," you can't deny that it's a powerful tool to quickly build a prototype.</p><p>From a cost perspective, licenses are expensive and they add up quickly. Millions of dollars are spent on IT licensing every year by large orgs. Imagine if that money was spent on employing core devs for the respective clients like we've seen with Red Hat, Bitpay, and Google.</p><blockquote>Developing a new product or business can often cost millions to develop with the traditional IT infrastructure and business processes. Timelines, again, are measured in years, not weeks.</blockquote><h2 id="risk-averse">Risk-averse</h2><p>The final piece to the puzzle which impedes progress and innovation is often a risk-averse nature. Being risk-averse is 'consultant speak' inside a large organization. Entire teams are dedicated to mitigating risk. I've heard a lot of different theories for why this is from insiders and outsiders over the years:</p><p><strong>Job security</strong> is one that gets floated around a lot. The 25 year Rolex, the benefits, and the cushy salary really don't require a whole lot. Don't upset the status quo, don't argue with the wrong people, play the politics, and work well with others. Do those 4 things and you have very little to worry about. Large companies rarely fire people who do those things. It's easy for anyone to become complacent when basic needs are taken care of. Unfortunately for them however, disruption requires risk. There's always the risk of being wrong. Being wrong is rarely celebrated in corporate culture and that stigma can follow someone around for the rest of their career preventing any sort of upward mobility. In our world, many of us have failed a few times, succeeded a couple, and worked for several companies. Our entire attitude towards failure and opportunity is a completely different perspective.</p><p>Another is the <strong>high visibility</strong> that corporations have in the public eye. Because of their size, most things they do are considered <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/news/newsworthy.html">newsworthy</a> due to the impact it could have on their customers, employees, or investors. In the startup world, we have the luxury of being able to fail relatively quietly. Our customers and beta users are usually very understanding of certain degrees of failures to the point they even expect them. Remember those corporate departments dedicated to risk management? These often include legal, public relations, and marketing communications teams. They all have the responsibility to keep the public face of the company as free from blemishes as possible.</p><blockquote>Disruption requires risk. No great invention, change, or innovation ever came from doing the same thing over and over. <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/not-innovating/">You have to be ready to break things along the way</a>.</blockquote><h2 id="their-disadvantage">Their Disadvantage</h2><p>When you begin to understand the issues that are faced by teams tasked with innovation projects, skunkworks programs, or disrupting old models you can see how simple objectives for us turn into difficult ones for them. While many of us perhaps envy their resources, they're actually at a huge disadvantage to us in every other way. They have a massive problem, one that we set out to solve:</p><blockquote>For them innovation, product development, and skunkworks is expensive, slow, regulated, ineffective, and swimming against the current.</blockquote>

December 10, 2020 | https://jonathancarter.org/2020/12/10/centos-stream-or-debian/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jonathancarter.org/2020/12/10/centos-stream-or-debian/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>It’s the end of CentOS as we know it</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, the CentOS project announced the shift <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">to CentOS stream</a>. In a nutshell, this means that they will discontinue being a close clone of RHEL along with security updates, and instead it will serve as a development branch of RHEL.</p><p>As you can probably imagine (or gleam from the comments in that post I referenced), a lot of people are unhappy about this.</p><p>One particular quote got my attention this morning while catching up on this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838889/">week’s edition of Linux Weekly News</a>, under the distributions quotes section:</p><blockquote><p>I have been doing this for 17 years and CentOS is basically my life’s work. This was (for me personally) a heart wrenching decision. However, i see no other decision as a possibility. If there was, it would have been made.</p><cite><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839521/">Johnny Hughes</a></cite></blockquote><p>I feel really sorry for this person and can empathize, I’ve been in similar situations in my life before where I’ve poured all my love and energy into something and then due to some corporate or organisational decisions (and usually poor ones), the project got discontinued and all that work that went into it vanishes into the ether. Also, 17 years is really long to be contributing to any one project so I can imagine that this must have been especially gutting.</p><p><strong>Throw me a freakin’ bone here</strong></p><p>I’m also somewhat skeptical of how successful CentOS Stream will really be in any form of a community project. It seems that Red Hat is expecting that volunteers should contribute to their product development for free, and then when these contributors actually want to use that resulting product, they’re expected to pay a corporate subscription fee to do so. This seems like a very lop-sided relationship to me, and I’m not sure it will be sustainable in the long term. In <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">Red Hat’s announcement of CentOS Stream</a>, they kind of throw the community a bone by saying “In the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce low- or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases”- it seems likely that this will just be for experimental purposes similar to the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider program</a> and won’t be of much use for production users at all.</p><p>Red Hat does point out that their <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi">Universal Base Image</a> (UBI) is free to use and that users could just use that on any system in a container, but this doesn’t add much comfort to the individuals and organisations who have contributed huge amounts of time and effort to CentOS over the years who rely on a stable, general-purpose Linux system that can be installed on bare metal.</p><p><strong>Way forward for CentOS users</strong></p><p>Where to from here? I suppose CentOS users could start coughing up for RHEL subscriptions. For many CentOS use cases that won’t make much sense. They could move to another distribution, or fork/restart CentOS. The latter is already happening. One of the original founders of the CentOS project, Gregory Kurtzer, is now working on <a href="https://rockylinux.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rockylinux.org/">Rocky Linux</a>, which aims to be a new free system built from the RHEL sources.</p><p>Some people from Red Hat and Canonical are often a bit surprised or skeptical when I point out to them that binary licenses are also important. This whole saga is yet another data point, but it proves that yet again. If Red Hat had from the beginning released RHEL with free sources and unobfuscated patches,  then none of this would’ve been necessary in the first place. And while I wish Rocky Linux all the success it aims to achieve, I do not think that working for free on a system that ultimately supports Red Hat’s selfish eco-system is really productive or helpful.</p><p>The fact is, Debian is already a free enterprise-scale system already used by huge organisations like Google and many others, which has stable releases, LTS support and ELTS offerings from external organisations if someone really needs it. And while RHEL clones have come and gone through the years, Debian’s <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">mission and contract to its users</a> is something that stays consistent and I believe Debian and its ideals will be around for as long as people need Unixy operating systems to run anywhere (i.e.  a very long time).</p><p>While we sometimes fall short of some of our technical goals in Debian, and while we don’t always agree on everything, we do tend to make great long-term progress, and usually in the right direction. We’ve proved that our method of building a system together is sustainable, that we can do so reliably and timely and that we can collectively support it. From there on it can only get even better when we join forces and work together, because when either individuals or organisations contribute to Debian, they can use the end result for both private or commercial purposes without having to pay any fee or be encumbered by legal gotchas.</p><p>Don’t get caught by greedy corporate motivations that will result in you losing years of your life’s work for absolutely no good reason. Make your time and effort count and either contribute to Debian or give your employees time to do so on company time. Many already do and reap the rewards of this, and don’t look back.</p><p>While Debian is a very container and virtualization friendly system, we’ve managed to remain a good general-purpose operating system that manages to span use cases so vast that I’d have to use a blog post longer than this one just to cover them.</p><p>And while learning a whole new set of package build chain, package manager and new organisational culture and so on can be uhm, really rocky at the start, I’d say that it’s a good investment with Debian and unlikely to be time that you’ll ever felt was wasted. As Debian project leader, I’m personally available to help answer any questions that someone might have if they are interested in coming over to Debian. Feel free to mail leader_AT_debian.org (replace _AT_ with @) or find me on the oftc IRC network with the nick <em>highvoltage</em>. I believe that together, we can make Debian the <em>de facto</em> free enterprise system, and that it would be to the benefit of all its corporate users, instead of tilting <em>all</em> the benefit to just one or two corporations who certainly don’t have your best interests in mind.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Companies chasing DevOps have an internal team dedicated to automation. Developers use tools built by this team to run and operate their code. They have many names, but let’s call them Platform, which most companies do.</p><p>Platform teams create abstractions on top of the infrastructure. The goal is to increase developer speed and make systems reliable. They increase speed by simplifying infrastructure APIs and reliability by automating manual tasks. <strong>Automation lowers the risk of service disruptions, but companies aren’t automating the highest-risk tasks.</strong></p><p><strong>What should we automate?</strong></p><p>We used to ship software by accessing servers and running commands inside boxes to pull new code. Now code goes from Git to servers without human intervention. Developers define what they need with code. Platform teams build the tools to make code changes become running systems.</p><p>The goal is doing this for everything, from business code to infrastructure like networking, databases, and queues. But this is hard. Platform teams have a lengthy backlog; they focus on items demanded with higher frequency.</p><p>Developers make manual changes for things not yet automated. Some companies have compliance, regulations, and other constraints. <strong>It’s hard to get developers direct access to production. So they have the Platform team running these changes for developers.</strong></p><p>It’s what makes the higher frequency items get priority. Engineers want to write software, not run repetitive manual tasks. But this backlog is never decreasing. The business changes and adopts new technologies. Headcount grows, adding new items to the automation backlog. And this mysterious type of task is always left behind.</p><p><strong>One-offs.</strong></p><p>Sometimes a bug in software messes with a customers' money, time, health, or ego. They won’t wait for three iterations of code reviews, tests, code analysis, and gradual rollouts. It takes time. Someone will access the database and update it. These are one-off scripts. <strong>They solve a problem for one or a few customers before the team creates a definitive fix.</strong></p><p>One-off scripts have a terrible reputation. When this happens too much, it’s a sign that the software is not stable. In the ideal world, it would never happen. Engineers would spot such time-critical problems during the design and code review phases. Production issues should be light and wait for regular software delivery flow.</p><p>Almost every company lives under the illusion that one-offs should not exist. Or that they will stop happening at some point. Yes, one should not do this every day. <strong>But having a few senior engineers run manual scripts in production because it’s an exceptional case is a mistake.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Almost every company lives under the illusion that one-offs should not exist.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Am I doing one-offs?</strong></p><p>Here are some common one-off solutions companies use in production:</p><ul><li>Call Raketasks using Rails console.</li><li>Use IEx to call Elixir functions.</li><li>Exec into servers/containers/pods and make localhost calls to an HTTP API</li><li>Make DML queries against the database.</li><li>Run bash/Python scripts through VPNs.</li></ul><p><strong>A myth.</strong></p><p>One-offs won’t go away, and companies need to embrace it. Avoiding them will drive the company to the wrong path. Centralizing execution with experienced engineers; or creating a team dedicated to analyzing and running them isn’t reasonable. It’s the opposite of DevOps.</p><blockquote><p>One-offs won’t go away, and companies need to embrace it.</p></blockquote><p>Most big companies solve this problem with a slow and manual Change Management workflow. Developers find the problem and add a script to a ticketing system. <strong>Someone from the operations team runs it without all the context</strong> of what she is doing. Avoiding one-offs is the shortest path to this model.</p><p><strong>What about Runbooks?</strong></p><p>Runbooks are great. Tools like <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rundeck</a>
and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackStorm</a>
automate fixing problems you know exist. They remove manual operations for routine tasks. But 1) creating Runbooks takes time, and 2) Runbook tools focus on infrastructure. One-off solutions need a faster track and application layer changes.</p><p>One-offs are the most challenging piece to automate. When you don’t know what problems will happen, it’s hard to build a solution upfront. Few companies I know 1) embrace one-offs, and 2) and try to automate them.</p><p><strong>For unknown unknowns, pre-existing solutions won’t work.</strong> The automation supporting this flow needs to be open-ended. The fastest is using direct access to resources and running ad-hoc solutions manually. But we can do better. It won’t get to the level of regular code, but we can get close.</p><blockquote><p>When you don’t know what problems will happen, it’s hard to build a solution upfront.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Isn’t this a bad incentive?</strong></p><p>A common misconception about one-offs is that formalizing them will increase their usage. They are faster to build than regular code. So it makes sense to think developers will prefer them over traditional pipelines. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. <strong>By making one-offs first-class citizens, you start to measure them. You can only change what you measure.</strong></p><p>One-offs must link to tasks with definitive fixes. Teams running them too much should decrease the number of features in the next sprint. Product prioritization should take into account what types of one-offs happen the most. All this is only possible with measurements. There is no upside in making one-offs hard to build and run.</p><blockquote><p>There is no upside in making one-offs hard to build and run.</p></blockquote><p><strong>One-offs as first-class citizens</strong></p><p>I built automations to support one-off scripts at previous jobs. It took a few months for the team as we had other duties, and the solution was not perfect. But <strong>developers were happy with the autonomy</strong> to build and run all solutions to their problems. Security and compliance were happier with audit trails &amp; logs. SREs were happy with fewer manual interventions in production. It was hard but paid off.</p><p>Today, I’m the founder of <a href="http://runops.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RunOps</a>
, a tool that automates one-offs. It lets you run scripts as if you had direct access to resources. Still, transparent controls and reviews make them safe, compliant, and reliable.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Yesterday we launched <a href="https://typefully.app/">Typefully</a>, a write-only interface for Twitter, after weeks of work and refinement. I documented the whole story on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a>.</p>
<p>Not much deep work happened on launch day and for good reasons. It was a bigger launch than <a href="https://francescodilorenzo.com/mailbrew-launch-numbers">Mailbrew's</a>.</p>
<p>Here the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>16,400 Pageviews </li>
<li>1,432 Signups </li>
<li>1,843 Drafts created</li>
<li>256 Threads published</li>
<li>$155 Revenue (more on this at the end).</li>
</ul>
<p>The traffic breakdown reveals what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker News: 6.3k</li>
<li>Twitter: 2.1k</li>
<li>ProductHunt: 1.9k</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, we finally managed to hit the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25358108">Hacker News frontpage</a>. </p>
<p>The perfect formula was:</p>
<ul>
<li>interesting product</li>
<li>no-bullshit title</li>
<li>sparking a controversial discussion in the comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to Twitter, we have been building a following there for some time, so it was a matter of publishing the <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo/status/1336589322670268416?s=21">right tweet</a>, at the right time, and getting the right people to retweet it.</p>
<p>For Product Hunt, we partnered with our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris</a>. His followers got a notification when he hunted us, but we also did our part and emailed our lists.  That helped to get fast on the front page and to kickstart the discussion.</p>
<p>Once we were in front of enough people, the product did the rest.</p>
<p>Servers did hold up without a sweat. </p>
<p>It's crazy what you can do these days with a couple of well-configured dynos on Heroku and a Django app! We peaked at 8 RPS when we hit the HN frontpage.</p>
<p>Typefully was born as <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio</a>'s personal side-project. I jumped in to make the editor crazy-fast, and write the server-side code. When <a href="https://twitter.com/meseali">Ali</a> helped us refine positioning and copy, we knew we had a winner and promoted it to an official <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> project.</p>
<p>Plans for the future? Implement all the great feature requests we got, and monetize this thing. </p>
<p>We launched with a tip-jar system where people could become <em>patrons</em> by tipping us, but with $150 earned after a crazy launch day like this, it's clear that this is not going to pay the bills. </p>
<p>We are thinking of adding some paid features. What's free is gonna stay free though, because this was first and foremost a labor of love.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm speaking in front of 200 people tomorrow on the topic around software development for startups. There are hundreds of books written on this so I'll try to condense my learnings from most.</p><p>Even though we're a startup company at <a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>, I stopped hiring software engineers, hell I tried to unlearn and relearn a few things in the journey as well.</p><p>Confusing I know - I still have to grapple around the entirety of it all but the honest truth is being a software engineer alone will get you easily fired or unvalued in a startup.</p><p>You need to fire yourself from that role and re-hire yourself as a product engineer. I've referenced this point multiple times in my previous articles and I really stand by this.</p><p>I don't think this necessarily applies for larger companies when they're hiring specialists and algo heavy engineers, however in a startup you need to think about the product, the marketing and most important the customer.</p><p>There is a significant disconnect in larger firms from the creator (developer) to the end user, all the way from hierarchy, to Project Managers, to Product Managers, to Marketers, to Execs etc - but in a startup, if you push code up... it's up.</p><p>So whats so special about being a product engineer that a software engineer can't do? A few things:</p><h3>1. They carry a get shit done attitude</h3><p>Sure some engineers carry that too, these statements aren't binary or exclusive but address the vast majority. When you look at github discussions or you look at conference events where people share their discoveries, it's all based around the engineer - not as much around the customer.</p><p>So yes, product engineers have a get shit done attitude, keeping in mind that they need to push good work out, but are quick on their feet to understand how much of debt some technical decisions will be vs others. This will be understood better over time, and even after a decade of programming, I can confirm that there is no right or wrong answer, its extremely situational based.</p><h3>2. Business first, software second</h3><p>You should toughen up and realise that building on the latest and greatest tech will not make you a better engineer. You almost NEVER have as much a good reputation for being the engineer for a bad startup as you may of a good startup, even though your code in the bad startup might be worthy of awards and your code in the good startup might be worthy of firing. It's inherent you see - good code isn't coincidentally in good companies, its because the companies made the smart decision of hiring mini-CTOs, people who understood that their customer mattered as much as their code.</p><p>This doesn't mean you give up all morals and build on PHP(I'M JOKING :p), but it kinda does. Not PHP but any language that is deemed unfit just because it's popular or not. You do a direct risk analysis on what will get me to my next goal ASAP. Whether that's faster iteration, more features or modularised code bases.</p><h3>3. Customer first, business second</h3><p>It should all come down to how you can make the life of the customer as easy as possible when you're solving the problem for them. Sometimes business requirements become business requirements and not customer requirements, and if you're just a software engineer by title, you will be doing what you're told to do because thats the limitation you have, at least the limitation I had a couple of years ago.</p><p>By stepping out of that box and understanding that if the business requirements step outside of the customer requirements, you get to voice your opinion and more importantly add the kicker to your "opinion" by justifying it with your technical abilities, techies are badass, we're the makers, so in the end if we have the knowledge around consumerism AS well as execution, it'll make us bulletproof.</p><p>So yes, if you're in a startup - don't work as a software engineer, work as a product engineer. Your impact will be 10X I kid you not.</p><p>People will take you ALOT more seriously, you'll climb the ranks faster, your code will matter a lot more, and the impact will be at scale. Your work matters and there should be no reason why more people shouldn't experience your genius code, the way you can make that happen is by being product focused and ensuring your customers are having the best time of their life.</p><p>As with any post, I'm always always looking to learn and become better at what I do, so I'd love to hear what you have to say, good or bad 🙌</p><p>If you liked this, definitely follow me on for the similar stuff:</p><p>twitter: twitter.com/<a href="https://dev.to/veebuv">@veebuv</a><br>linkedin: linkedin.com/in/vaibhavnamburi<br>instagram:_veebuv</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Recently I found myself needing to process and visualize both point clouds and meshes in an iOS application utilizing ARKit, with the point cloud being gathered using the 2020 iPad “LiDAR” sensor. To enable maximum performance and content creation convenience I thought it would be nice to have both custom shaders and a regular, easy-to-work-with 3D hierarchy available. The best options available seemed to be Metal and SceneKit, which required some initial setup to get working together. That setup is detailed in this post.</p>
<p><em>If all this sounds unfamiliar see <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/lidar-peek-into-the-future-with-ipad-pro-11d38910e9f8">here</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/2243-scene-kit-tutorial-getting-started">here</a> for introductions to these technologies.</em></p>

<p>To help you recreate what I did, the post is accompanied by a GitHub repository showing the specifics: <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal">github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note that the repo uses slightly confusing naming. XCode project name is “smTest” (for “SceneKit Metal test”), which leads to combinations such as smTestTest for the auto-generated unit testing project… not the best choice, but bear with me.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note that this is not really beginner level stuff, nor is having both SceneKit and Metal rendering usually required. If you just want to do some 3D+AR on iOS, good tech to start with would likely be either <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a>+<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating_3d_content_with_reality_composer">RealityComposer</a>, the more widely applicable tool <a href="https://tutorialsforar.com/creating-an-ar-app-for-ios-using-unity-and-arkit/">Unity</a> or just plain <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/building-an-ar-app-with-arkit-and-scenekit/">SceneKit</a>.</em></p>

<p>RealityKit seems like the future, but I was interested in custom shaping of meshes at runtime with e.g. geometry shaders and there did not (yet?) seem to be hooks for integrating that kind of processing in RealityKit.</p>
<p>Turns out those hooks do exist in SceneKit, which is an older and more mature technology. They can be used to implement custom render steps either before or after regular rendering. A helpful blog post with details that aided me with the ‘<strong>renderer didRenderScene</strong>’ hook can be found here: <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">Custom Metal Drawing in SceneKit</a>. Thanks for the writeup Mr. Ippel!</p>
<p>I chose to get started with combining ARKit, SceneKit and custom Metal rendering by mashing two of Apple’s example applications together:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Scene Depth demo app (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">Visualizing a Point Cloud Using Scene Depth</a>)</li>
<li>The default SceneKit AR project created by the XCode project wizard (creation steps depicted below)</li>
</ul>

<p>The trickiest part was to get the depth blending working correctly. SceneKit and the custom Metal renderer of the Point Cloud demo use different depth buffer conventions, which caused a few moments of initial confusion before realizing I would have to adjust depth settings to make them compatible.</p>
<p>Initial depth buffer ranges <em>(from memory, might be incorrect)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SceneKit:</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = zero</li>
<li>growing towards camera</li>
<li>range around 0.00-0.05</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SceneDepthPointCloud Metal renderer</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = negative infinity(?)</li>
<li>shrinking towards camera</li>
<li>range around 1.0-9.9995</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the depth blending behave nicely and consistently, it was needed to set the proper depth blending mode (<em>shown as DepthStencilState –&gt; DepthCompareFunction in the XCode Frame Debugger</em>), to find matching value ranges for both depth buffers and to keep the 3D scenes of both renderers in their respective camera frustums (having good values for znear and zfar) so that they would not get culled off by being too near or too far.</p>

<p>If you’re working in a recent Apple dev environment in a fairly empty project, there’s a good chance you can get started with GPU debugging right away. You just need to build and run your app and press the camera icon (and wait a bit):</p>

<p>For more specific details on how I combined the two renderers, see the changes included in the first few commits (Nov 24th &amp; 28th) on the <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commits/main">commits page</a> of the example repository. It shows the history of how I:</p>
<ul>
<li>started with a blank SceneKit AR project using the Project Wizard (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/3d5358507d2824d0d57335d6988ec81d20291b9d">Initial commit</a>)</li>
<li>added custom Metal rendering as per Mr. Ippel’s <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">post</a> (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/75ad32f2012594ba3c09df9f351299d64f0ecb59">draws simple triangle, …</a>)</li>
<li>copied in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">SceneDepthPointCloud</a> demo and made sure the application still builds (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/cbcdaf130a288a7ad68cd2a848ddd671269b93d6">builds with SceneDepthPointCloud …</a>)</li>
<li>fiddled with accumulation settings etc confusedly to get the thing closer to working (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39ba6d28e7f22ae202e20344c503a2136932f3ff">almost works …</a>)</li>
<li>and finally adjusted the depth blending, depth range and camera frustum settings to be able to see both scenes together (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/4a60df6c60b380d72ec740171c3440ffa09ddc23">improved …</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39c9a0e7a997567ca978e1190b67cd2af9790666">draws both …</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of all these steps can be seen in motion below. It is of course merely the starting point for a more interesting application that leverages the ease and speed of regular 3D asset workflows and selectively applies the power of customized GPU processing as needed.</p>



<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/485931370?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>At the time of first publication of this post (Dec 2020) I’m not sure if the depth buffer is entirely in sync between the two renderers, even though they both do render simultaneously. The point cloud looks alright behind the rocketplane(? 😄), but I’m not sure whether they behave correctly in overlap situations. However, the fix should be just a matter of adjusting camera and depth buffer parameters and possibly scene scale (<em>famous last words…</em>).</p>
<p>If and when time permits, I will update the post and the repository with improved details.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>A few weeks ago I was in a bad place.</p>

<p>My product Pegasus—a <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Django boilerplate for SaaS applications</a>—was 
having its worst sales slump in recent history.
Meanwhile, my other product, Place Card Me—an <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">online place card maker</a>—continued
to be hit hard by the pandemic, with sales down almost $10,000 from 2019.
It looked like I was going to fall short on my targets for the month. 
<em>Again</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/place-card-me-2020.png" alt="Place Card Me"></p>

<p>The grey line is Place Card Me’s profits in 2019. The purple line is 2020. Thanks, Covid.</p>

<p>And then on a lark I thought, “well maybe I’ll try running a Black Friday sale.”</p>

<p><strong>And my month’s trajectory completely changed.</strong></p>

<p>A few hours of work and a week later, and I had shattered my previous earnings for any month—earning
more than 3 months’ worth of typical profit in a single week.</p>

<p>Through the process, I learned a lot about running sales—lessons I thought I should share.
Because Black Friday <em>is</em> a huge opportunity for online creators and indie hackers. 
One that—if you’re anything like me—you’re probably not taking full advantage of.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did and what I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-to-run-a-sale-by-overcoming-the-ickiness-factor">Deciding to run a sale by overcoming the “ickiness factor”</h2>

<p>If you’re like me, your first reaction to the idea of a Black Friday sale might be something along the lines of 
“ugh, those are so overdone and spammy”.
And it’s true, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales have become ubiquitous online.</p>

<p><em>But Black Friday sales aren’t inherently bad.</em></p>

<p>Many consumers, including myself, happily take place in Black Friday deals.
They’re a great way to support creators and pick up products you’ve long considered buying.</p>

<p>To get over my fear of “Black Friday ickiness”, I decided to turn to other successful creators who were also running deals.
Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger of <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> / <a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a>;
online educator extraordinaire <a href="https://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>;
fellow solopreneur <a href="https://mtlynch.io/">Mike Lynch</a> for his product <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/">TinyPilot</a>.
How were they doing Black Friday and what could I learn from them?</p>

<p>My favorite example came from Wes Bos, which <a href="https://marketingexamples.com/">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a>
did a great job analyzing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wes-bos-black-friday.jpeg" alt="Wes Bos Black Friday"></p>

<p>Wes Bos’s “masterful” Black Friday email. Image and analysis from <a href="https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1331573176405536769">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a></p>

<p>This email and the others I looked at all shared similar qualities.
They were <em>genuine</em>, they <em>put the reader first</em>, and they <em>weren’t too pushy</em>.
It was “hey, here’s a great deal in case you’re interested, if not, sorry to bug you.”</p>

<p>Seeing that it was possible to run a deal in a classy way was enough to get me over the “ickiness” factor,
and provided a framework for crafting my own sales communications.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Running a sale doesn’t have to be “icky” if you do it right.</strong></p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-sale-structure-by-adding-value">Choosing the right sale structure by <em>adding value</em></h2>

<p>People expect Black Friday deals to offer a huge discount from normal prices—particularly 
for online products. Here’s a typical deal I received, with bundle of fonts being offered at 95% off 
the normal price:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wild-ones-black-friday.png" alt="Wild Ones Font Bundle"></p>

<p>A typical Black Friday deal—offering 95%-off a bundle of commercial fonts.</p>

<p>Offering a huge discount is a great way to drive sales, but it comes with a huge cost. 
<em>Literally</em>. A big discount will substantially reduce your revenue-per-customer and 
leave money on the table.</p>

<p>And that’s not the only problem.</p>

<p>In addition to the lost revenue, <em>massive discounts devalue your product</em>.
If your customers know that you sometimes sell your product for 95% off, they’re likely 
to think it’s only worth 5% of it’s price.
<em>You’ve just turned your valuable good into a commodity.</em></p>

<p>So how do you run a sale without reducing your prices? <strong><em>You add value.</em></strong></p>

<p>Take Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger’s deal.
They took their two products, <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> (normally $249) and 
<a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a> (normally $149), and bundled them together for $279.
Their customers are simultaneously <em>saving $120</em> while <em>paying more than the price of either individual product.</em>
This is adding value at its finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/refactoring-ui.jpg" alt="Refactoring UI Black Friday"></p>

<p>The Tailwind UI / Refactoring UI deal—which used bundling to offer 30% off while simultaneously increasing prices.</p>

<p><em>Bundling</em>—what Adam and Steve did by offering two products together at a discount—is a great way to 
add value while not lowering prices.
A similar approach is to <em>offer increased benefits on a lower pricing tier</em>. 
This is the approach I took with my own product.</p>

<p>My product, <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">SaaS Pegasus</a>, is designed to help people launch new web applications quickly.
Pegasus has two pricing tiers, a <em>single-site</em> version for $295, and an <em>unlimited</em> version for $750.
The product is the same, but the single-site version is only able to be used on—well—a single site,
while the unlimited version can be used on—you guessed it—unlimited sites.
The unlimited version also comes with lifetime updates to Pegasus itself, instead of just a year.</p>

<p>Anyway, the details aren’t important, but what <em>is</em> important is that more than 90% of my customers 
opt—at least initially—for single-site. 
So for my Black Friday deal I decided to offer the unlimited version at price of single-site. 
This allowed me to offer a 60% discount without significantly reducing my revenue per customer
or devaluing my product.</p>

<p>Whether you use bundling, the “increased benefits on a lower tier” approach, or something else, 
adding value is a great way to create a “Black Friday deal” feeling while not incurring 
some of the financial and psychological costs associated with heavy discounting.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Don’t lower prices, add value.</strong></p>



<p>Ok, you’ve gotten over the ickiness factor and you’ve chosen a sale structure that adds value.
Now’s the most important part: <em>spreading the word</em>.</p>

<p>When considering how best to get the word out, think of the following breakdown.
Everyone is either <em>interested</em> or <em>not interested</em> in your sale.
Likewise everyone will either <em>find out</em> or <em>not find out</em> about it.
This creates four buckets that any person might fall into:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/sale-matrix.png" alt="Sale Categorization Breakdown"></p>

<p>Breakdown of the possible ways people can experience your sale.</p>

<p>The two green boxes are what you’re aiming for. 
Of course, you want everyone who might be interested in the sale to find out about it—these are your potential customers!
Also, you want everyone who <em>isn’t</em> interested in the sale to not get spammed by it—the blissfully unaware.</p>

<p>The tradeoffs and mistakes happen in the red boxes.
What you really want to prevent is <em>lost customers</em>—people who would have been interested in the deal
but never knew it was happening.
You also want to annoy as few people as possible, but <em>it’s generally better to promote the deal to someone who wasn’t interested
than to have someone who was interested miss it</em>. 
The upside of a potential sale clearly outweighs the downside of mildly annoying someone.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Default to promoting everywhere that the signal-to-noise ratio isn’t terrible.</strong></p>

<h3 id="where-to-promote-your-sale">Where to promote your sale</h3>

<p>The key avenues for promotion—in order of importance—are your <em>website</em>, your <em>email list</em>, and <em>other online marketing channels</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Your website is your best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>No one is more likely to be interested in your deal than someone who is already browsing your product website,
so you should do everything you can to ensure all website visitors see your deal.</p>

<p>I used the common technique of splashing a big-ass colorful banner on every page of the site.
Here’s what it looked like.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-sale.png" alt="Pegasus Sale"></p>

<p>Don’t be shy promoting your sale on your website. These are the people most likely to benefit from it.</p>

<p>Your goal is to make it impossible for someone visiting your website to not hear of the sale,
so err on the side of flashy, even if it seems a bit much.</p>

<p><strong>Your email list is your next best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>People on your email list were interested in your product at one point, and so are more likely
than almost anyone else to still be interested, so make sure to let them know!</p>

<p>My email sequence consisted of two mails:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An email at the start of the sale telling people about it.</li>
  <li>An email with 24 hours left in the sale telling people it was about to end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people add a third email in the middle—often with 48 hours to go. 
I don’t recommend more than 3 emails as you seriously risk pushing people 
further into the “annoyed” category.</p>

<p>In terms of email copy—you can’t do better than the Wes Bos example above.
But for the sake of transparency, here’s the mail I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-email.png" alt="Pegasus Email"></p>

<p>The first email in my sequence announcing the Pegasus Black Friday deal.</p>

<p>One difference between Wes and I is that my email list is <em>cold</em>—I almost never use it.
So I added a reminder for people who might be wondering what Pegasus even was.
I also included details on some new features to show that I’m still improving the product.</p>

<p><strong>All other channels besides your website and email list are a distant third in terms of usefulness.</strong></p>

<p>For this reason, I severely limited promotion in other places unless they were 
specifically aggregating Black Friday deals—and therefore unlikely to annoy anyone.</p>

<p>Depending on your product and audience, social media can be a good channel, though it’s not for Pegasus
so I didn’t bother promoting there.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s important to realize that unless you did something very wrong, 
<strong><em>people will be more likely to purchase your product during a sale than at any other time.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, if you’ve taken the advice above and are still getting good revenue-per-customer during
the sale, there is an interesting side-effect:
<strong>website traffic <em>during a sale</em> is more valuable than at any other time</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll show you just how much more valuable it was for me in the next section <em>(preview: it was way more than I expected)</em>.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that any additional effort you can expend to get people to your website—for any reason—will 
have a higher payoff during a sale.</p>

<p>How you leverage this information depends on your marketing strategy.
If you’re running ads, consider increasing your budget while the sale is running;
if you do content marketing, consider publishing your next big article during the sale, etc.
These efforts—while not necessarily directly related to the sale—will have the side-effect of getting
more eyes on your site at the exact moment your …</p></div></div>

			<blockquote>
  <p>This is the story of how close we came to shutting down before even launching our first product, how we survived, and the lessons we learnt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In March, 2020, when COVID hit the world, our startup Milkie Way too was hit with a big blow and almost shut down. <strong>We burnt $72,000 while exploring and internally testing Cloud Run with Firebase within a few hours.</strong></p>

<p>In November 2019, after having the idea, I started developing <strong>Announce <a href="https://annc.in/">https://announce.today</a></strong>. The goal was to create an “MVP”, a functional V1 of the  product, and for this reason our code was based on a simple stack. We used JS, Python and deployed our product on Google App engine.</p>

<center>
<em>Announce on Desktop</em>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/post_images/anc-first-look.png" width="100%"><br>
</center>

<p>Having a very small team, our focus was on writing code, designing the UI and getting product ready. I spent minimal time in Cloud management, just enough to make us go live, and have basic development flow (cicd) going.</p>

<p>In the V1 web application, user experience was not the smoothest, but we just wanted to make a product that some of our users could experiment with, while we built a better version of Announce. With Covid hitting the world, we thought it was the best time to make a difference as Announce could be used by the governments to make announcements world wide.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to have some rich data on the platform even if users don’t create content to begin with? This thought that led to another project, called <strong>Announce-AI</strong>. It’s purpose was to create rich content for Announce automatically. Rich data == events, safety warnings like earthquakes, and possibly local relevant news.</p>

<h3 id="some-technical-details">Some Technical Details</h3>
<p>To begin developing Announce-AI, we used Cloud Functions. As our bot scraping the web was fairly young, we believed light weight Cloud functions were the way to go. However, as we decided to scale, we ran into troubles because Cloud Functions have a timeout of ~9 minutes.</p>

<p>At this time we learn about Cloud Run, which then had a big free usage tier! Without understanding it completely, I asked my team to deploy a “test” Announce AI function on Cloud Run, and see it’s performance. The goal was to play around with Cloud Run, so we can learn and explore it really fast.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/cloud-run.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>Google Cloud Run</em></center>

<p>To keep it simple, as our experiment was for a very small site, we used Firebase for database, as Cloud Run doesn’t have any storage, and deploying on SQL server, or any other DB for a test run would have been an over kill.</p>

<p>I created a new GCP project ANC-AI Dev, set up $7 Cloud Billing budget, kept Firebase Project on the Free (Spark) plan. The worst case we imagined was exceeding the daily free Firestore limits if we faltered.</p>

<p>After some code modifications, we deployed the code, ran it by making few requests in middle of the day manually and then left it.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-begins">Nightmare Begins</h3>
<p>Everything went fine on the day of test, and we got back to developing Announce. Next day after working, I went for a quick nap in late afternoon. On waking up I read few emails from Google Cloud, all sent within few minutes of each other.</p>

<center>
<em>First Email: Auto upgrade of our Firebase Project</em>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/auto-upgrade.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<center>
<em>Second Email: Budget Exceeded</em>

<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/budget.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<p>Luckily my card had a spending limit of $100 preset. This led to declining the charges, and Google suspending all our accounts with it.</p>

<center>
<em>Third email: Card was declined</em>

<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/card-declined.jpg" width="80%"><br>
</center>

<p>I jumped out of the bed, logged into Google Cloud Billing, and saw a bill for ~$5,000. Super stressed, and not sure what happened, I clicked around, trying to figure out what was happening. I also started thinking of what may have happened, and how we could “possibly” pay the $5K bill.</p>

<p>The problem was, every minute the bill kept going up.</p>

<p>After 5 minutes, the bill read $15,000, in 20 mins, it said $25,000. I wasn’t sure where it would stop. Perhaps it won’t stop?</p>

<p>After two hours, it settled at a little short of $72,000.</p>

<p>By this time, my team and I were on a call, I was in a state of complete shock and had absolutely no clue about what we would do next. We disabled billing, closed all services.</p>

<p>Because we used same company card across all our GCP Projects, all our accounts and projects were suspended by Google.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-continues">Nightmare Continues</h3>
<p>This happened on Friday evening, March 27th, 3 days before we had planned V1 of Announce to go live. Our product development was dead as Google suspended all our projects as they were tied to same credit card. My morale was as low as it could be, and the future of our company was unsure.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/suspended.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>All our Cloud Projects were suspended; development stopped</em></center>

<p>Once my mind made peace with this new reality, at midnight I sat down to actually investigate what happened. I started writing a document detailing all the investigations… I called this document: “Chapter 11”.</p>

<p>Two of my team members who were in this experiment also stayed up all night investigating and trying to make sense of what had happened.</p>

<p>The next morning on Saturday, March 28th, I called and emailed over a dozen law firms to book an appointment / have a chat with some attorney. All of them were away, but I was able to get response from one of them over email. Because the details of the incident are so complicated even for engineers, explaining this to an attorney in plain english was a challenge of its own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a bootstrapped company, there was no way for us to come up with $72K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this time, I was well versed with Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy and mentally prepared of what could come next.</p>

<h3 id="some-breather--gcp-loopholes">Some Breather : GCP Loopholes</h3>

<p>On the Saturday after sending emails to lawyers, I started reading more and going through every single page in GCP Documentation. We did make mistakes, but it didn’t make sense that Google let us spend $72K without even making a payment on the project before!</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/firebasegcp.jpg" width="80%"><br>
<em>GCP and Firebase</em></center>

<h4 id="1-automatic-upgrade-of-firebase-account-to-paid-account">1. Automatic Upgrade of Firebase Account to Paid Account</h4>
<p>We never anticipated this, nor was this ever displayed while signing up for Firebase. Our GCP project had billing connected to have Cloud Run execute, but Firebase was under Free plan (Spark). GCP just out of the blue upgraded it, and charged us for the amount it needed to.</p>

<p>It turns out this is their process as “Firebase and GCP are deeply integrated”.</p>

<h4 id="2-billing-limits-dont-exist-budgets-are-at-least-a-day-late">2. Billing “Limits” don’t exist. Budgets are at least a day late.</h4>
<p>GCP Billing is actually delayed by at least a day. In most of their documentation Google suggests using Budgets and auto shut-off cloud function. Well guess what, by the time the cut off function would trigger, or the Cloud Users be notified, the damage would’ve probably been done.</p>

<p>Billing takes about a day to be synced, and that’s why we noticed the charges the next day.</p>

<h4 id="3-google-was-supposed-to-charge-us-100-not-72k">3. Google was supposed to charge us $100, not $72K!</h4>
<p>As our account had not made any payment thus far, GCP should’ve first made charge for $100 as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-cycle#find-threshold-amount">per billing info</a>, and on non-payment, stopped the services. But it didn’t. I understood the reason later, but it’s still not the user’s fault!</p>

<p>The first billing charge made to our account was of ~ $5,000. The next one for $72,000.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/automatic-payments.jpg" width="100%">
<em>Billing threshold for our account was $100</em>

</center>

<h4 id="4-dont-rely-on-firebase-dashboard">4. Don’t rely on Firebase Dashboard!</h4>
<p>Not just Billing, but even Firebase Dashboard took more than 24 hours to update.</p>

<p>As per Firebase Console documentation, the Firebase console dashboard numbers may differ ‘slightly’ from Billing reports.</p>

<p>In our case, it differed by <strong>86,585,365.85 %</strong>, or 86 million percentage points. Even when the bill was notified to us, Firebase Console dashboard still said 42,000 read+writes for the month (below the daily limit).</p>

<h3 id="new-day-new-challenge">New Day, New Challenge</h3>
<p>Having been a Googler for ~6.5 years and written dozens of project documents, postmortem reports, and what not, I started a document to share with Google outlining the incident, and adding the loopholes from Google’s side in a postmortem. Google team would come back to work in 2 days.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some readers suggested that I used my internal contacts at Google. The truth is that I haven’t been in touch with anyone, and I used the path that any normal developer / company would take. Like any other small developer, I spent countless hours on chat, in consults, lengthy emails, and bugs. In one of my next posts on how to look at incidents, I’d like to share the doc/postmortem I sent to Google during this incident.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/googleplex.jpg" width="40%"><br>
<em>Last day at Google</em></center>

<p>Another task was to understand our mistake, and devise our product development strategy. Not everyone on the team knew what was going on, but it was quite clear that we were in some big trouble.</p>

<p>As a Googler I had experienced teams making mistakes costing Google millions of dollars, but the Google culture saves the employees (except engineers have to write a long incident report). This time, there was no Google. Our own limited capital and our hard work, was at complete stake.</p>

<hr>

<p>This post is already getting long, so I’ll continue the details of how we managed to make this blunder, how we survived, and what did we learn.</p>

Distributing computational expensive simulations among the available resources, avoiding duplication and keeping the data safe are challenges that scientists face every day.</p><p id="8d66">In this post we present our web service <a href="https://insilico-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Insilico</a> and its command line interface <a href="https://moka-command-line-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Moka</a>. Insilico solves the problem of <em>computing</em>, <em>storing</em> and <em>securely sharing</em> computationally <em>expensive</em> simulation results. Researchers can save significant time and resources by easily computing new data and reusing existing simulation data to answer their questions.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9856/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk" width="4928" height="3280" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bI9DbwobcmYvOYyk?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@publicpowerorg?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">American Public Power Association</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="71c5">At the <a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/" rel="noopener">Netherlands eScience Center</a> we empower academic researchers by building together simulation tools, data pipelines, etc. A common goal among several tools that we develop for projects in different scientific fields, is to reduce the calculation time of computationally expensive physical simulations (e.g. molecular processes) by applying statistical methods to previously simulated data.</p></blockquote><p id="204c">The aforementioned methodology can potentially save us significant human and computational resources by easily generating high value data using previous computations. But before we are ready to apply any statistical method we of course need the data and for doing so, we need to ask ourselves questions like:</p><blockquote><p id="7c69">What input is required?</p><p id="75eb">Who is going to perform the simulation?</p><p id="a35c">What facilities are going to be used?</p><p id="93ec">Where is the resulting data going to be stored?</p><p id="6091">How to access the available data?</p></blockquote><p id="6fb9">Physical simulations usually require intricate input that takes into consideration several aspects and parameters used by different models to approximate the phenomena under consideration. Also, scientific simulations are computationally demanding tasks, so they are usually run in (inter)national supercomputers or very specialized facilities. We also want to maximize the impact of the data in the scientific community, therefore we want other scientists to be able to access the data and even add their own, but we need some security layers to protect such valuable data.</p><p id="bcb8">There is no silver bullet to address all the previous questions, but there are amazing initiatives like the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/" rel="noopener">folding at home project</a> that distributes some computational tasks among volunteers around the world who give away some time in their computers to simulate protein dynamics.</p><p id="6858">It seems that if we want to collaborate on the distribution of computational tasks and the assemblage of the resulting data, we need a central “entity” that (1) allows users to request new tasks, (2) receives the task’s results to be stored and (3) returns some available data when requested. It sounds like we need a web service!</p><blockquote><p id="6a2b">Writing a web service is a nontrivial task, you need to be aware of different technologies, libraries, etc. while making sure that your data is going to be safe and of course you need some infrastructure to host your service. This post goal is to give you some hints about building a web service for scientific applications and it is by no means a complete guide to writing web applications.</p></blockquote><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9662/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ" width="4831" height="3221" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnschno?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">John Schnobrich</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a44e">Before entering into the web service technical details, let’s explore what its behavior should be.</p><p id="74cc">So, once it has been decided what are the best approximations and models to perform the simulations, we can compile all the simulation metadata into different jobs. For instance, a job can be a single molecular simulation under some specific conditions.

If the client requests some read-only action you just return the data (if available) and if the client wants to change something, you need to ensure that (1) the client has permissions to mutate the data (2) only the mutations specified by the client are carried out but nothing more. I will skip authentication in this post.</p><p id="2b72">Therefore, the <a href="https://insilico-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Insilico</a> web service needs to handle two kinds of requests by the client: read-only queries and mutations on the datasets. These “queries” and “mutations” can be easily describe with <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a>.</p><p id="0dbe">In a nutshell, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> defines a contract (known as a schema) between the actions that a client can perform with the web service and the possible outcomes of those actions. More formally, <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> is a query language that allows you to specify an application Programming interface (API) using different programming languages. If you have previous experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" rel="noopener">RESTful API</a> have a look at a comparison between <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/" rel="noopener">GraphQL and REST</a>.</p><p id="ecf0">But how does GraphQL work? First, you need to define a schema using the <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> schema language. The following code snippet defines a schema to query a job using its status,</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definition for job query</figcaption></figure><p id="2045">The <strong>Query</strong> schema specifies that in order to request some <strong><em>jobs</em></strong> you need to provide a <em>Status</em> argument, where <em>Status</em> can be one of four possibilities: <em>AVAILABLE, DONE, FAILED</em> and <em>RUNNING. </em>The exclamation mark (!) indicates that the argument cannot be <em>Null</em> (a.k.a <em>None</em> in Python).</p><p id="5870">The following <strong>Mutation</strong> schema defines the required arguments to update a given job status.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definitation for Job status mutation</figcaption></figure><p id="9dd2">The <strong><em>updateJob</em></strong> action specifies that you must provide an <em>id</em> and a <em>new_status</em> in order to be able to update a job. You will receive a <em>Reply</em> specifying whether the update action has succeeded.</p><p id="54d3">Have a look at the Insilico <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Query.graphql" rel="noopener">queries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Mutation.graphql" rel="noopener">mutations</a> schemas. They are slightly more complex than the aforementioned schemas but follow the same rationale as the previous examples. You can also have a look at the official <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" rel="noopener">introduction to GraphQL</a>.</p><p id="33f0">We have just defined the schemas that specify the actions that we want to perform. We still need to implement the actions and for doing so, we need a GraphQL engine: a library that takes the schemas together with the code that implements the actions and generates an API.</p><p id="39ea">We have chosen the <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette GraphQL engine</a> to implement our web service mostly because it is easy to use and open source. The following snippet shows a possible implementation for querying jobs based on their status using <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="affa">the <strong><em>Resolver</em></strong> decorator indicates that the <strong><em>resolver_query_jobs</em></strong> function corresponds to the implementation of the <strong><em>query jobs</em></strong> schema. The function takes 4 arguments of which I only use <strong><em>args</em></strong> and <strong><em>ctx</em></strong><em> </em>(You can refer to <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a> for further details). <strong><em>args </em></strong>contains the arguments given by the client code, while <strong><em>ctx </em></strong>contains the context for running the current function, for example the handler to access the database that is called <strong><em>mongodb</em></strong> in this code snippet.</p><p id="9242">Notice that the definition of the aforementioned function starts with the <em>async</em> keyword. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="noopener">Asyncio</a> is a popular built-in Python library to write concurrent code. It is extensively used to write high performance web services.</p><p id="fb0a">In the Insilico web service implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/tree/master/provisioning" rel="noopener"><strong>queries</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/mutation_resolvers.py" rel="noopener"><strong>mutations</strong></a>, there are definitions for all the Python functions that perform the actions specified in the GraphQL schemas. For each query and mutation, there is a corresponding function.</p><p id="632b">We need a database not only for storing the interesting data but also to store the jobs metadata, like what jobs are available. For the Insilico web service we use <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a>.</p><p id="1b90">My personal opinion is that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" rel="noopener">NoSQL database</a> like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a> gives a significant advantage over traditional SQL databases on research projects where up-front design of the schemas to store data is unfeasible.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Using AI to make industrial assets more efficient and reduce their downtime is on many agendas. Learn how digital twins and time series data play a major role in this plan.</p><article>
      
<p><strong>When interviewed, CEOs across industries all state that AI is part of their top priorities.</strong> But when it comes to actual implementation AI projects are not very glamorous. Past simple proofs of concept and the hiring of a team of data scientists, there is usually no sign of the highly anticipated digital transformation wished by the CEOs.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons for this disenchantment, far too many to list here. But among those, some are directly related to what we focus on at <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a>, data, and the way industries introduce them in their environment.</p>



<h2>No digital transformation without data</h2>



<p>The willingness to transform is genuine in many organizations, driven by ambitious visions or just the consciousness that the competitive landscape is evolving.</p>



<p>The next step is usually for those businesses to pick some quick wins to prove that the transformation can be initiated and comfort everyone that it does not mean changing teams or radically modifying their way of working.</p>



<p>Those short projects aim at demonstrating the methodology for transforming limited operational perimeters. They often involve solving a problem with approaches to leveraging new technologies. Those technologies, 100% digital, need fuel to work, and that fuel is data. <strong>So the first step is to ensure data are available</strong>.</p>



<p>The firms hired to help in building those quick wins will then wander among departments. They will harvest datasets here and there until they have sufficient matter for implementing their solutions.</p>



<p>This step can sometimes take time if the data is not well identified and distributed across the organization. But it is a mandatory path to follow as without data no digital transformation will happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>No AI without big data</h2>



<p>Past the simple quick wins done to bootstrap the transformation comes a time when more ambitious projects are brought on the table, and that is when AI (Artificial Intelligence) comes into the conversation. The hype around AI is so strong that projects around AI and ML (Machine Learning) cannot be neglected.</p>



<p>The problem with the current hype is that very few people really understand what AI actually implies. <strong>For many</strong>,<strong> you buy an AI like you buy a Microsoft Office 365 subscription</strong>, this is just not true. The promise of AI is to bring new, automatic, ways to use data to help in or even completely assume the decision process. This promise can only be fulfilled if the actual AI put to work, otherwise called the model, is actually trained on the data in your very own organization, and this requires once again the same digital transformation fuel, data. The difference is that this time you need more of it. You are no longer trying to light a fondue burner but a rocket engine!</p>



<p>Training a model does indeed require a lot of data covering the various aspects of your business operations you want the model to focus on, also covering a long period of time so trend and seasonality can be modeled. </p>



<h4>This has several impacts</h4>



<ul><li>The first is that you cannot expect to train a model and efficiently introduce AI in your operations until you actually have collected enough meaningful data. And if your organization has not done so so far you need to start as soon as possible. </li><li>The second impact is that this data collection process is not a one time job. It does not stop once you have enough data for training a model. It needs to go on and on so you keep on accumulating signals on how your business operates to retrain your models in the future if their performance starts to degrade. This means that prior to your journey into the core of AI you need to plan for big data to be collected, stored and made available to teams across your organization so they can start looking at the data and imagine possible uses and models.</li></ul>



<h2>No industrial AI without Digital Twins</h2>



<p>Among verticals, industrial organizations face the hardest problems of data collection. Industries whose data mainly relates to users using their services are lucky. In the end, their data are not that massive. Sure we have all heard stories of banks or retailers hoarding piles of data. But we are talking about a few thousand interactions per year per user. So even with a billion users, which not that many banks or retailers have, we are talking a few trillion events per year.</p>



<p>In the industrial world, things are different, the assets producing data do not eat or sleep. They work day and night and sometimes produce thousands of measurements per second.</p>



<h3>For example...</h3>



<p>Take for example the CERN experiments at the LHC. They produced 600 million events per second during the campaigns for the quest of the Higgs boson. That is 51 trillion events per day. Luckily for the CERN, not all events needed to be retained. With highly efficient AI-based detectors, which needed to be trained with massive data themselves, they were able to limit the production to 100 000 events per second sent for digital reconstruction and ultimately 200 events persisted per second. </p>



<p>But other sectors need to retain more data. Synchro phasors (or PMUs, phase monitoring units) monitoring electrical grids, for example. They each produce several 1000s measures per second, and there are thousands of those at the scale of a country like France. This means millions of C37.118.2 messages sent every second, not to mention the IEC61850 messages sent to supervise the substations. </p>



<p>Same thing in aeronautics where aircraft typically produce 5 000 to 15 000 data points per second they are operating, or industrial assets whose PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) track the state of many sensors and actuators.</p>



<p>The use of AI in those verticals requires that those truly massive data be collected and organized. Since they are data related to physical assets, it is wise to use an approach which mimics these assets in a digital form, this approach is called Digital Twins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>What are Digital Twins?</h3>



<p>The Digital Twin of an asset is the set of measures coming from its sensors and actuators. Those measures need to be tracked in time to catch the dynamics of the assets' operations. And the technology of choice to do so is a <a href="https://blog.senx.io/which-time-series-database-suited-to-your-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Series Database</a>. Indeed Digital Twins are nothing else than time series, some for the sensors, some for the actuators with their states. And if you want more advanced digital twins, some with the control commands sent to the assets to modify how it behaves.</p>



<p>Once you start collecting the data from your assets in a Time Series Database, you can easily access the state of those assets at any point in time. More importantly, you can start extracting features to train models to detect anomalies and perform predictive maintenance.</p>



<h2>Takeaways</h2>



<p>AI is on every business' agenda, but the importance of data is too often overlooked. <strong>When it comes to industrial AI, the first step towards a successful implementation is the collection of all sensor data to build Digital Twins of the physical assets involved.</strong> This approach needs to leverage a Time Series Database, the kind of database SenX offers with the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Time Series Platform</a>.</p>

Still, web applications have been increasing in <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complexity and size</a>, with rising load times. It is therefore clear why the topic of webpage performance is more popular today than it likely ever was.</p> <p>This article aims at giving a practical introduction to the whys and hows of web performance, without getting lost in the depth or breadth of this massive topic.</p> <h2 id="why-performance-matters"><a href="#why-performance-matters">#</a> Why performance matters</h2> <p>The time it takes for a service to become usable, as well as its general responsiveness, bear a lot of weight on the user's perception of that service. Helpful features, great design and other prominent characteristics all become irrelevant when an online service is so slow that users navigate away.</p> <p>You can build the best web application in the world, but be mindful that each user will have a specific amount of time they are willing to invest in your service to solve their problems. Exceed that amount, and you risk losing them to a different, more performant solution. This is even truer for new users, who haven't yet been given proof of the quality of your service, and are essentially investing their time up-front, hoping for a return.</p> <h3 id="a-competitive-differentiator"><a href="#a-competitive-differentiator">#</a> A competitive differentiator</h3> <p>There is a brighter side to the topic: if low performance can sink an online platform, high performance can very well help it rise to the top. Speed and responsiveness can be a differentiating characteristic for a service, prompting users to choose it over the competition. Therefore an investment in this area will almost always pay off. Some notorious real-world examples from known businesses include:</p> <ol><li>Pinterest decreasing wait time for their users, <a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing both traffic and conversions</a>.</li> <li>Zalando applying small improvements in load time and finding a direct correlation with <a href="https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2018/06/loading-time-matters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased revenue per session</a>.</li> <li>The BBC discovering that every extra second that a page took to load led to 10% of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-the-bbc-builds-websites-that-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users leaving the page</a>.</li></ol> <h2 id="measuring-performance"><a href="#measuring-performance">#</a> Measuring performance</h2> <p>Given the importance of page performance, it is no coincidence that browsers expose a ton of insights into <a href="https://web.dev/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance metrics</a>. Being aware of how your application scores against these <em>across time</em> will provide you the feedback you need to keep it performant for your users. There are several approaches that can be combined to achieve the best results:</p> <ol><li><em>Real user monitoring</em> to understand what performance actual end-users of your service are experiencing.</li> <li><em>Synthetic monitoring</em> to proactively gather intel on service performance, as well as to find issues before users stumble into them.</li> <li><em>Performance testing</em> to avoid releasing performance regression to production in the first place.</li> <li><em>Regular audits</em> to get an overview of your page's performance and suggestions on how to improve it, e.g. with tools such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Lighthouse</a>.</li></ol>  <p>As much as we should be striving to build performant applications, we should commit to monitoring and testing performance to enable continuous feedback and rapid intervention in case of degradation. Puppeteer and Playwright give us a great toolkit to power both synthetic monitoring and performance testing.</p> <ol><li>Access to the Web Performance APIs, especially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceNavigationTiming</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceResourceTiming</a>.</li> <li>Whenever testing against Chromium, access to the Chrome DevTools Protocol for traffic inspection, network emulation and more.</li> <li>Easy interoperability with performance libraries from the Node.js ecosystem.</li></ol> <h3 id="web-performance-apis"><a href="#web-performance-apis">#</a> Web Performance APIs</h3> <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigation Timing</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Timing</a> performance APIs are <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a> specifications. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Navigation_and_resource_timings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN docs</a> very clearly define the scope of both:</p> <blockquote><p>Navigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.</p></blockquote> <p>We can use the Navigation Timing API to retrieve timestamps of key events in the page load timeline.</p>  <p>The Resource Timing API allows us to zoom in to single resources and get accurate information about how quickly they are being loaded. For example, we could specifically look at our website's logo:</p>  <h3 id="chrome-devtools-for-performance"><a href="#chrome-devtools-for-performance">#</a> Chrome DevTools for performance</h3> <p>The Chrome DevTools Protocol offers many great performance tools for us to leverage together with Puppeteer and Playwright.</p> <p>One important example is network throttling, through which we can simulate the experience of users accessing our page with different network conditions.</p>  <p>The DevTools Protocol is quite extensive. We recommend exploring the <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and getting a comprehensive overview of its capabilities.</p> <h3 id="additional-performance-libraries"><a href="#additional-performance-libraries">#</a> Additional performance libraries</h3> <p>Lighthouse can easily be used programmatically with Playwright and Puppeteer to gather values and scores for different metrics, like <a href="https://web.dev/interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time To Interactive (TTI)</a>:</p>  <h2 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">#</a> Further reading</h2> <ol><li>The comprehensive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Performance documentation</a></li> <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/#performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev's performance section</a></li> <li><a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/puppeteer-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Performance Recipes With Puppeteer</a> by Addy Osmani</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/aslushnikov/getting-started-with-cdp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting started with Chrome DevTools Protocol</a> by Andrey Lushnikov</li> <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Started with Google Lighthouse</a></li></ol></div></div>]]>
