<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

December 4, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/5 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/5">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/dh.png"></p>
<p><em>Reference: <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh</a>. Used with permission.</em></p>
<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB.png">
</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

<p>An interesting way for getting an intuitive sense for why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability" title="Poker hand probabilities">certain hands</a> are rare in poker, I've laid out all the cards in a standard deck in a grid:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/blank_1024x1024.png?v=1607133617" alt="Array of Playing Cards" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024">
</p>


<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, high card, is the most common happening 50% of the time, but will rarely be the winning hand:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_1024x1024.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card" width="1023" height="1023"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134962" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/three_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135086" alt="3 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_1024x1024.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_1024x1024.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_1024x1024.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135809" alt="Straight Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Royal_Flush_1024x1024.png?v=1607135877" alt="Royal Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>


<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_1024x1024.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-04_at_18.42.56_1024x1024.png?v=1607136337" alt="Flower Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Want More?</h2>
<p>If you found this interesting, you'll probably love the 3D reconstruction we did of <a href="https://evermontbills.com/pages/walter-white-did-not-have-80m" title="Walter White's Cash Pile Counting">Walter White's cash pile</a> in order to count it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Esperanto Technologies develops high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions for Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning based on the open standard RISC-V instruction set architecture. Esperanto is headquartered in Mountain View, California with engineering sites in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas in the United States and multiple sites in Europe. Esperanto has brought together a seasoned team of experienced processor and software engineers with the goal of making RISC-V the architecture of choice for compute-intensive applications such as AI and Machine Learning.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them). Users asked for and got the ability to restore texts in another iPhone, before iCloud was available. I also implemented other privacy features such as requiring a password to open the mobile app.</p><blockquote><h3 id="what-i-didnt-realize-at-the-time-however-is-that-i-had-unknowingly-and-unwillingly-built-a-spying-tool-and-a-really-convenient-and-efficient-one">What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</h3></blockquote><p>Enough users were paying the fee to become VIP that I could cover the costs of running the service–this was before everyone was using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so I was renting a co-located physical server which wasn’t cheap–and keep some pocket cash. Not much, but enough to pay for some hobbies and outings with friends.</p><p>Most importantly, building YouArchive.It gave me a lot of satisfaction and the opportunity to learn a lot of things about software development, business, dealing with customers and listening to their feedback.</p><hr><p>When I finally shut the service down, in June 2010, YouArchive.It had about 32,000 registered users who stored over 76 million messages.</p><p>The first, and stated, reason for the deprecation was a technical one: YouArchive.It’s iPhone app required using private APIs, which meant it could not be published on the App Store (and it still couldn’t to this day), limiting it to <em>jailbroken</em> phones only.</p><p>The second reason however was the most important to me, even though I have not revealed it until now.</p><p>About a year before the app closed, in April 2009 I implemented a new feature that was requested by many users: the ability to upload texts automatically, in background, without user intervention. For paying “VIP” users only, the mobile app could automatically send all new text messages to YouArchive.It, as often as every 15 minutes.</p><p>Automatic upload was an incredible convenience for many users that wanted to hoard their texts like me, to keep them forever, search within them, print or export them, or just liked having a backup.</p><p>What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</p><p>Thanks to background uploads, people could install the YouArchive.It app on another person’s iPhone, set it up, maybe even hide it (something possible on a <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone), and then watch as the text messages come in, almost real-time. Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</p><p>I can’t remember how I discovered that — it might have been a support request from a user or a post in a bulletin board. I also can’t know how many people were using YouArchive.It for their own archiving rather than to spy on others. Realizing what my users were doing, however, made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not want any part of that anymore.</p><p>As a senior in high school, barely eighteen years-old, I realized for the first time how technology can have a …</p></article></div>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60E52DB6-B5F7-48D8-8FC5-73A5CE8F8AF4">Big White Ghetto: Dead Broke, Stone-Cold Stupid, and High on Rage in the Dank Woolly Wilds of the "Real America"</a>" by Kevin D. Williamson.</em></p>
<p>"Dogfood—yeah, <em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>—because it looks like ground-up dog food.” He’s embarrassed to be talking about this. “Or sand, because it’s brown. Or diesel. Or killa or 9-1-1. That’s the influence of rap culture down here.” He is a young, clean-cut, Eagle Scout–ish white kid, hesitant about using the words “rap culture,” like he’s not sure if he’s allowed to say that. But he goes on, matter-of-factly. He’s been off heroin for only a few months, so the details are fresh in his mind, even if he remains a little hazy on parts of his autobiographical timeline. “The 9-1-1, they call it that because they want you to know it’s potent, that you’ll have to go to the emergency room.”</p>
<p>That’s a weird and perverse and nasty kind of advertising, but then dope-buying psychology isn’t very much like Volvo-buying psychology: Crashing is just another part of the ride. One spiteful dealer boasts about spiking his product with excessive amounts of fentanyl—a pharmaceutical analgesic used for burn victims and cancer patients—his plan being to intentionally send overdosed users to the hospital or the morgue . . . for <em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em> <em>p</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>p</em><em>os</em><em>e</em><em>s</em>. Once the word got out about the hideous strength of his product, that killa went right out the door ricky-tick.</p>
<p>The young man explaining the current vocabulary of opiate addiction in Birmingham is barely old enough to buy a beer, and his face and voice are soft. He describes the past several years of his life: “dope-sick and stealing,” going from job to job—eight jobs in six months—robbing his employers of everything not physically nailed to the floor, alienating his family, descending. He was an addict on a mission: “You’re always chasing that first shot of dope, that first high—and the first one for me almost killed me. I was seventeen or eighteen years old, and I met a guy who had just got out of prison, doing a thirteen-year sentence for heroin possession and distribution. He was staying at the Oak Mountain Lodge, which is a nice little classic place.” (In 2013, four police officers and a drug dog had to be treated for exposure to dangerous chemicals after raiding a suspected meth lab in that hotel; the customer reviews online are decidedly mixed.) “I was <em>snorting </em>heroin when I met up with him, and set him up with my connect. He offered to shoot me up, and I wanted to do it. And I remember him looking me in the eyes and telling me, ‘If you do this, you’ll never stop, and you’ll never go back.’ And I said, ‘Let’s do it.’”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what happened for the next several hours. When he regained consciousness, his junkie buddy’s girlfriend was worriedly ministering to him.</p>
<p>“That was first thing in the morning,” he says. “That night, I did another one.”</p>
<p>Same results. “I’d nodded out from snorting it, but there’s nothing like shooting it.”</p>
<p>He was, he says, a “pretty good junkie” for a time.</p>
<p>This particular opiate odyssey starts off in a Walgreens, something that turns out to be absolutely appropriate. I’m headed up the south coast and then inland on the heroin highway up to Atlanta, starting from the Port of Houston, which connects that city with 1,053 ports in nearly 200 countries and which in December alone welcomed the equivalent of 63,658 20-foot cargo containers of goods into the United States. There was, the feds are pretty sure, some dope squirreled away in there. In fact, all sorts of interesting stuff comes in and out of Houston. In May, U.S. Customs seized a Fast Attack Vehicle with gun mounts headed to the Netherlands. It hadn’t been ordered by the Dutch military. (Organized crime in the Netherlands is bananas: A raid in the summer of 2020 found Dutch police opening up a shipping container expecting to find it loaded with narcotics or stolen goods, but what they found instead was a dentist’s chair bolted to the floor and handcuffs hanging overhead—it was set up as a mobile torture chamber, God knows why.) I’m at Walgreens because I’ve got a long drive ahead and I’m going to be out of pocket for a bit, and I have a prescription to fill: an honest-to-goodness Schedule II Controlled Substance, in the official nomenclature, a term that covers some pretty interesting stuff, including the oxycodone and fentanyl I’ll be hearing so much about in the next few days. Some of us are going to heaven, some of us are going to hell, but all of us have to stop at Walgreens first.</p>
<p>The clerk is on the phone with a doctor’s office: “What’s your DEA number?”</p>
<p>For working-class white guys who haven’t found their way into the good jobs in the energy economy or the related manufacturing and construction booms that have reverberated throughout the oil patch, who aren’t college-bound or in possession of the skills to pay the bills, things aren’t looking so great: While much of the rest of the world gets healthier and longer-lived, the average life expectancy for white American men without college educations is declining. Angus Deaton, the Princeton economist who won the Nobel Prize in 2015, ran the numbers and found (in a study co-authored by his Princeton colleague Anne Case) that what’s killing what used to be the white working class isn’t diabetes or heart disease or the consumption of fatty foods and Big Gulps that so terrifies Michael Bloomberg, but alcohol-induced liver failure, along with overdoses of opioid prescription painkillers and heroin: Wild Turkey and hillbilly heroin, and regular old heroin, too, the use of which has increased dramatically in recent years as medical and law-enforcement authorities crack down on the wanton overprescription of oxy and related painkillers.</p>
<p>Which is to say: While we were <em>ignoring </em>criminally negligent painkiller prescriptions, we helped create a gigantic population of opioid addicts, and then, when we started paying attention, the first thing we did was take away the legal (and quasi-legal) stuff produced to exacting clinical standards by Purdue Pharma (maker of OxyContin) and others. So: lots of opiate addicts, fewer prescription opiates.</p>
<p>What was left was diesel, sand—<em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>.</p>
<p>The clerks at this Walgreens are super friendly, but the place is set up security-wise like a bank, and that’s to be expected. This particular location was knocked over by a young white man with a gun the summer before last, an addict who had been seen earlier lurking around the CVS down the road. This is how you know you’re a pretty good junkie: The robber walked in and pointed his automatic at the clerk and demanded oxy first, then a bottle of Tusinex cough syrup, and then, almost as an afterthought, the $90 in the till. Walgreens gets robbed a lot: In January, armed men stormed the Walgreens in Edina, Minnesota, and stole $8,000 worth of drugs, mainly oxy. In October, a sneaky young white kid in an Iowa State sweatshirt made off with more than $100,000 worth of drugs—again, mainly oxy and related opioid painkillers, from a Walgreens in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other Walgreens locations—in Liberty, Kansas; East Bradford, Pennsylvania; Elk Grove, California; Kaysville, Utah; Virginia Beach; New Orleans—all have been hit by armed robbers or sneak thieves over the past year or so, and there have been many more oxy thefts.</p>
<p>It won’t make the terrified clerks feel any better, but there’s poetic justice in that: In 2013, Walgreens paid the second-largest fine ever imposed under the Controlled Substances Act for being so loosey-goosey in handling oxy at its distribution center in Jupiter, Florida, that it enabled untold quantities of the stuff to reach the black market. The typical pharmacy sells 73,000 oxycodone pills a year; six Walgreens in Florida were going through more than 1 million pills a year—each. A few years before that, Purdue was fined $634.5 million for misleading the public about the addictiveness of oxycodone. Kentucky, which has been absolutely ravaged by opiate addiction, is still pursuing litigation against Purdue, and it has threatened to take its case all the way to the Supreme Court, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>Ground Zero in the opiate epidemic isn’t some exotic Taliban-managed poppy field or some cartel boss’s fortified compound: It’s right there at Walgreens, in the middle of every city and town in the country.</p>
<p>I pick up my prescription and get on my way.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, having driven past billboards advertising boudin and strip joints with early-bird lunch specials and casino after casino after sad little casino; help-wanted signs for drilling-fluid businesses and the Tiger Truck Stop (which has a twenty-four-hour Cajun café and an actual no-kidding <em>live tiger </em>in a cage out front); past Whiskey Bay and Contraband Bayou, where the pirate Jean Lafitte once stashed his booty; around the Port of New Orleans, another <em>entrepôt </em>for heroin and cocaine—it is almost as close to Cartagena as it is to New York—I arrive at a reasonably infamous New Orleans drug corner, where I inquire as discreetly as I can about the availability of prescription …</p></div></div>

      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,
    killing a low-hanging
    <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">RCE vector</a>.</li>
<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80242">some</a>
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76618">exploitable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to cinstants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>
<a href="https://lightless.me/archives/include-file-from-zip-or-phar.html">arcane</a>
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

<p>Although they might seem very similar, running and sprinting are two very different sports.</p>



<p>Running is a game of long distances. It requires steadiness and endurance. Sprinting, on the other hand, is a game of speed. It requires intensity and power.</p>



<p>Runners can’t race as fast as sprinters. And sprinters can’t last as long as runners. They are different games.</p>



<p>If audience building were a sport, it would be more like running than like sprinting.</p>



<p>You don’t build an audience in just one sprint — you need thousands of them. And if you try to sprint every day, you’ll end up burned out. It’s not sustainable.</p>



<p>You need to show up often and stay at it as long as possible. So instead of sprinting, you should try to run or even jog but at a pace you can keep up. That way it becomes sustainable.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, steadiness beats intensity. Put another way, sharing good content frequently beats sharing superb content infrequently.</p>



<p>Your content might be incredibly valuable, but if people only hear from you once in a blue moon they might not even remember who you are in the first place. They need to hear you often. They need to know you. They need to trust you.</p>



<p>Why should they give you their attention otherwise?</p>

		<p>Yesterday I faced a version control situation I rarely face.</p>

<p>It showed me that I may rely a little too much on the green light from CI tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions when deciding whether it’s safe to merge a branch.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My colleague added new <code>expect</code> clauses to a test, plus the code to <strong>pass it</strong>.</li>
  <li>They merged this into the main branch via a PR.</li>
  <li>Later, I forked off of the main branch.</li>
  <li>I added <strong>more new clauses</strong> to the test my colleague had earlier modified.<br>I worked on it for the rest of the day.</li>
  <li>I made a <strong>pull request</strong>.</li>
  <li>Next, two colleagues reviewed my work and approved it on GitHub.<br>All the pre-merge checks on CircleCI were passing, including tests and style checks.<br>I rebased and decided to save the merge for the morning.</li>
  <li>Soon after, an error was found related to the code the first colleague had deployed.<br>They <strong>reverted</strong> the PR they had merged on Day 1.</li>
  <li>Not long after, I checked my PR again - there were no merge conflicts.<br><strong>I merged my code</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An hour or so later, another colleague tells me that, according to CircleCI, a test I wrote was failing on the main branch. How could this be, they said? It appears to have been passing on the branch it came from!</p>

<p>What is the cause of this mysterious failure?</p>

<p>I’d recently touched that test, so I looked at the error and quickly worked out what it was: The test I’d added to was failing because one of it’s <code>expect</code> clauses relied on code which had been been reverted - it was no longer a valid expectation. GitHub didn’t run a new diff on my PR after the removal of the clause in question from the main branch; the reverted test code simply looks ‘unchanged’ in the diff, as if it had been and was still there.</p>

<p>I didn’t remove it, I didn’t rebase, and my PR ended up re-adding the recently-removed <code>expect</code> clause even though it didn’t appear to.</p>

<p>Is there a lesson to be learned here?</p>

<p>On one hand, the process is working. There was a merge error caused by the <code>git</code> equivalent of a race condition, we were told about it, and we were able to resolve it. Why bother running tests on the main branch before you deploy unless you are concerned that there is a chance they’ll fail?</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson is to keep on doing what we’re doing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process felt like it was disrupting the order of things. Something like this is often said: “if you have a reliable QA and CI process, then if something is on the main branch it should be deployable.” And yet here was an anomalous case which suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the lesson is that our QA and CI process isn’t robust enough. Should CI create a merged branch behind-the-scenes and run tests on <em>that</em> before allowing the branch to be merged?</p>

<p>I’m not sure. In the meantime, while I try to decide what the lesson is, I think I’ll just rebase my branches more often.</p>

<p><em>With all due respect to the people arguing this one way or the other – many of whom are super intelligent. This argument is a self-defeating doom loop that can only be resolved via an act of faith.</em></p>
<h3>Introducing your Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</h3>
<p>With both Bitcoin and gold (and stonks, for that matter) at or recently off of all time highs the age old debate of whether gold is better than Bitcoin or vice versa is everywhere. I finally sat down and mapped out the <strong>Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</strong> after listening to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/the-end-game-ep-12-fred-hickey/id1508585135?i=1000501094047">End Game podcast episode with Fred Hickey</a>, who writes <strong>The High Tech Strategist</strong>.</p>
<p>In it they hit on the perennial question of “gold vs Bitcoin” and Hickey laid out his objections to it. I’ve been a subscriber of The HTS for several years now and think it’s absolutely fantastic, and of course I also subscribe to <a href="https://ttmygh.com/">Grant Williams TTMYGH</a> and <a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/home.aspx">Fleck’s newsletter</a> as well. All great stuff, well written, from extremely intelligent people. I do get the sense that Williams is somewhat open to Bitcoin and he <em>wants&nbsp;</em>to talk about it and explore the idea that it may be something more than the usual tropes: <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/this-time-is-different-part-i-what-bitcoin-isnt/">a ponzi, based on nothing, Tulipmania, etc</a>, but maybe he’s hesitant at prospect of taking heat for suggesting it.<span id="more-1451"></span></p>
<p>I just find the entire debate pointless because people who invest in either asset class&nbsp;<em>are doing so for the same reasons.&nbsp;</em>They are reacting to the same threat, they see the same unsustainability, they are preparing for the same End Game, if you will.</p>
<p>Given that many of the people who see the underlying issues are of a capital allocator, long term mindset, why is this being thought of in terms of either/or and not in terms of probabilities and scenarios?</p>
<p>If the job at hand is to protect one’s wealth from systemically rigged and disintegrating monetary regime, arguing for one over the other feels like trying to defend against it with only half the available toolkit. Is there a mechanic who wouldn’t be caught dead with a screwdriver in his toolbox because he can give you a list of reasons why every problem can be solved with a wrench? “Screwdrivers for suckers!”</p>
<p>The entire gold vs crypto argument goes away when one realizes that there is more overlap in the objectives of each asset than there are differences. And if you can get your own biases out of the way, then even the differences when looked at objectively seem to have uncanny parallels</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gold</strong> has a 5,000 year track record, and has never failed to hold its value, which is quite impressive and has to count for something….<br>
<strong>Bitcoin</strong> has broken out of nowhere and taken the world by storm in an astonishingly small amount of time, which is quite impressive and has to count for something…</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is backed by nothing.<br>
<strong>Gold</strong> is just a shiny rock.</p>
<p>Without electricity, Bitcoin is useless.<br>
You can’t eat gold.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum computing</strong> will eventually destroy Bitcoin’s encryption.<br>
<strong>Asteroid mining</strong> will eventually make gold abundant and cheap.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a ponzi.<br>
What’s the definition of a gold mine? A hole in the ground with a liar standing beside it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could go on….</p>
<p>Since the future is unknowable and certainty elusive, aligning with one aspect of the above over the other has to be a choice not a fact. It’s an act of faith. So why not embrace agnosticism and make use of both sets of tools in your financial survival toolkit?</p>
<h3>The Toolkit</h3>
<p>Let’s just step briefly through some of the items in the mindmap. We have metals on one side, cryptos on the other.</p>

<div id="attachment_1452"><p><a href="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1452" loading="lazy" src="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png" alt="" width="800" height="492" srcset="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png 2074w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-300x185.png 300w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-1024x630.png 1024w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-150x92.png 150w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-768x473.png 768w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-1536x945.png 1536w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-65x40.png 65w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-220x135.png 220w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-163x100.png 163w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-358x220.png 358w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-650x400.png 650w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-731x450.png 731w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-829x510.png 829w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1452">Click for large version</p></div>
<p>On the cryptos side, I just think Bitcoin is the crypto-reserve currency and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. My preferred way to accumulate BTC is to earn it via my businesses. <a href="https://easydns.com/">easyDNS</a> has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013 and we’re <a href="https://easydns.com/landers/earn-crypto/">developing a payments service for clients</a> that will be based on <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPayserver.</a></p>
<p>I put Litecoin and alts in there to trigger the maximalists. As per the Supersuckers song, <em>“I like it all man. (All or nothin’ I’m all in even when I’m bluffin’)”.</em></p>
<p>Ethereum is different animal, I think the Bitcoin vs Ethereum schism is every bit as fucking stupid as Gold vs Bitcoin. They do different things, and while they overlap in some aspects, that doesn’t mean there should only be one path forward.</p>
<p>The way I think about it, Bitcoin is the value, Ethereum is the execution. When I hear people dismiss Bitcoin because “there is as yet no ‘killer app’ that anybody has come up with for Bitcoin” I like to ask them “what is the killer app for the money in your wallet?”. Do you want to be able to play video games on your money? Collaborate on a document with your coworkers before you spend it? Dollars or&nbsp; euros aren’t dismissed as useless because nobody has come up with a compelling use case for them. You just spend it. <em>That’s&nbsp;</em>the use case.</p>
<p>Ethereum on the other hand, well that’s a whole different ball game. Smart contracts, DeFi, even Dao’s (despite early setbacks) will completely transform our lives. Ethereum, and other projects like it (Cardano, EOS, and even Ravencoin, which is actually a Bitcoin fork)&nbsp; are going to provide ways to code parameters and instructions around value and wealth that will be guaranteed to execute and can outrun government overreach.</p>
<p>We’re now coming out of that <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/welcome-to-bitcoins-trough-of-disillusionment/">“Trough of Disillusionment”</a> I wrote about back in 2018 and we have actual companies, actual businesses and ways to derive income now in crypto. We can invest in miners, in crypto based publicly traded companies, we can stake our assets or lend them and earn a return on them. Multiple income streams available here so we actually have some ability to compound whatever wealth we’ve managed to port to the crypto-economy separate from any nominal gains garnered in fiat terms.</p>
<p>And of course, with crypto we have the ability to move capital, in figurative terms, simply by thinking about it. If Actual Communism comes to your habitat and the best you can manage is to get out with your skin and some pass phrases you’ve remembered in your head, you can retrieve some of your assets wherever you come up for air (read <a href="https://amzn.to/2IghIzy">“We The Living”</a>. Take it to heart. This is the fate we seek to avoid, and large chunks of the world are barreling straight at it).</p>
<p>On the precious metals side you have your physical metals which, if all goes well, you simply keep vaulted in various places and your currency never collapses and you teach your kids that they should preserve the hoard and only use it in extreme emergencies down the road. And to teach their kids the same. You have junk silver in case there <em>is&nbsp;</em>a currency crisis and you don’t want to have to carve off a piece of a Krugerrand in order to buy some food at the market.</p>
<p>You have some gold tucked away in international vaults like <a href="http://www.bullionvaultaffiliate.com/trustable">Bullionvault</a> and <a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/w/wealthnet">Goldmoney</a>. My cousins run <a href="https://www.trustablegold.com/">TrustableGold.com</a> which rates these places.</p>
<p>All of this stuff, especially on the crypto side, has to be set up in advance, and you have to know how to navigate these systems before TSHTF. When a mob of mostly peaceful democratic socialists are tearing through your town and burning down your homes and businesses, or when the government is hanging both goldbugs and HODL-ers from lamposts, you do not want to be learning how to set up a Monero wallet and frantically converting as much as you can into it, nor do you want to be just then opening your Goldmoney account and trying to wire in some funds.</p>
<p>It has to be ready <em>now</em>, so&nbsp; when the inevitable&nbsp;<em>Financial Repressions </em>intensifies, or God forbid, the <em>Financial Tyranny</em> occurs, you can focus on executing your exit plans and coming out on the other end with enough capital and wealth to rebuild.</p>
<h3>The missing link</h3>
<p>What we really need are bridges between crypto-currencies and gold. Not metaphorical “can’t we all be friends” bridges, I mean gateways, tokenized/staked storage and transfer of precious metals. Conversion into or out of crypto from metals. This is not easy.</p>
<p>There have been attempts in the past, <a href="https://theagora.libsyn.com/gold-vs-crypto">Roger Ver, in Sal the Agorist’s recent “Gold vs Bitcoin” podcast</a> mentioned e-gold. easyDNS was the only domain registrar to accept e-gold back in the day and that’s how we amassed our physical gold which remains on our balance sheet even now. But contrary to Ver’s assertion that the government’s shutdown of E-gold speaks to gold’s inferiority to Bitcoin – that’s not entirely accurate. E-gold turned a blind eye to governance and it really was a wild west of ponzi schemes and criminal activity. Contrast with other DGCs of the day, like Pecunix or Goldmoney, the latter of which still exists. Goldmoney had far more stringent KYC and governance protocols, self-enforced, and here they are – still up and running.</p>
<p>In fact it was Goldmoney who had one of the more recent attempts at Bitcoin to vaulted gold convertability under their incarnation as Bitgold. They’ve since discontinued this precisely because of the governance hurdles.</p>
<p>I won’t trivialize how hard this is, but for people droning on about the need for a ‘killer app’, this one would probably do well.</p>
<h3>It’s all about optionality</h3>
<p>Both metals and crypto tribes look at the financial system and our legacy institutions as entering some form of breakdown and decline. Because the future is inherently unknowable, what makes more sense?</p>
<p>A) Betting on one half of a toolbox that may pay off huge in some scenarios but be worthless in others, or</p>
<p>B) Having a full toolbox that can give you some good outcomes under most imaginable circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a goldbug</strong>, would it kill you to have a&nbsp;<em>fraction&nbsp;</em>of your liquidity in Bitcoin, knowing that from past events crypto superspikes tend to 10X or 100X or more with stubborn repetitiveness and increasing magnitude?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re into Bitcoin</strong>, buying the right gold miners now with a fraction of your capital may very well set you up with an increasingly fat, cushy dividend stream in a few years that you can use for living expenses while you continue to HODL.</p>
<p>Now there are many End Gamer luminaries out there who are invested in both even though …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

December 4, 2020 | https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-4.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-4.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today is the day, Fable 3 Nagareyama is officially released! Does this mean the latest version is bug-free? Probably not, but at least the install command is shorter. We have also tested the release candidates in many projects and managed to fix all the outstanding issues so if you find a problem when upgrading your Fable 2 project you may even consider yourself lucky (also, please report).</p>
<p>First things first, I have to acknowledge all the people that have contributed to this release: from Don Syme himself to ncave, our mysterious contributor, and all the early-users that have helped polish this release. Very importantly, the teachers too that take care of my children in difficult times so I can focus on programming. The fact that so many people can collaborate together to put a project like Fable forward still feels like magic to me and I can only say a big THANK YOU to you all. I'm also very happy this is coincidental with the release of F# 5, as incredibly smart people are putting a lot of effort to make the development experience with the language really pleasant. Quoting Krzysztof Cieślak, what a great time to be an F# developer!</p>
<p>How can you try Fable 3, you say? This is it:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet tool install fable
dotnet fable src</code></pre><p>(Change "src" with the path to your project.) It's that easy, type <code>dotnet fable --help</code> to see more options. Of course you still need extra tooling to bundle the JS code, spin off a development server, etc. If you're upgrading an app using Webpack, please <a href="https://github.com/MangelMaxime/fulma-demo/pull/43">check this PR for reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let's quickly go through the highlights of Nagareyama:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's Fable v3. Three is bigger than two, that's already a win.</li>
<li>There are no breaking changes, your Fable 2 project should compile as is with Nagareyama (you may need to update some libraries).</li>
<li>It's a dotnet tool, following suit with most F# project. Remember when Fable, Paket and Fake had each their own way to be downloaded and version-managed? Those days are happily gone!</li>
<li>It removes the inter-process communication with JS, greatly simplifying Fable usage and development.</li>
<li>The previous point together with other fixes have improved the compilation speed by a big deal. Expect it to be at least cut in half in most cases!</li>
<li>Fable is not tightly coupled with a specific bundler anymore like Webpack so you can use any tool you like! (Webpack is still a great choice.)</li>
<li>A lot of effort has been also put to prettify the generated code, making it more readable and easier to debug if needed.</li>
<li>Nagareyama can accept plugins by library authors. Zaid is already using this feature to make it much simpler to <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Ct3CM_lj4?t=860">write React components compatible with JS tooling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the <a href="https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-3.html">previous posts</a> for more details.</p>


<p>So what are you waiting for? Give Nagareyama a try and let the world know if it goes well... and let us know (privately) if it doesn't 😅 Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>Version 4.0 of TerminusDB - the Star’s End Release</strong> * - is a big step forward in solidifying and extending the functionality of TerminusDB and TerminusHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://terminusdb.com/">TerminusDB</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">open source</a>, revision control graph database designed for distributed collaboration. TerminusDB allows you to push, pull, time-travel and merge data, much in the way that is possible with code in Git.</p>

<p>With this release TerminusDB takes a significant step towards our vision of a general-purpose tool for data &amp; content management and collaboration.</p>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 extends the revision control features to allow greater visibility and reproducability by allowing you to look inside individual commits to see what changes were made. Provenance, lineage, and compliance are increasingly essential in the management of data and content.</p>

<p>The <em>major</em> additional features are:</p>

<h3 id="model-building-tool">Model Building Tool</h3>

<p>The database ships with an integrated visual schema building tool. It allows users to build complex data models using point and click tooling. This makes building models significantly quicker, more efficient, and inclusive of a broader range of people by lowering the technical bar for the application of business rules to your data.</p>

<p>It lets you visually design knowledge graphs in the same way they are presented to business users. We have tried to make the tool easy to use, while preserving the ability to model the most complex domains.</p>

<p>Like everything in TerminusDB, the models are versioned so you can make changes in testing and if it breaks your database, you can easily roll back to an earlier working version. This <strong>collaborative knowledge graph design and implementation functionality</strong> does not exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>You can currently share your models/schemas through TerminusHub - the next step is to make modelling and collaboration even easier by providing data-libraries on TerminusHub, including schema.org but also basic standard models for common domains such as CRM, accounting, and inventory. Users can then generate and share models with collaborators or the broader public.</p>

<h3 id="document-editor">Document Editor</h3>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 has full surfability, clickability and editability of database documents through the console. It is a wiki or catalogue of all your data that you can edit in place. You don’t have to write code or execute a query, just edit the document directly. If you have a collaborative project, this is a useful approach to building and curating data assets.</p>

<p>The documents link to associated documents delivering a linked data application. You can filter documents, you can find the document you want using search, you can create a new document in the interface - it is a <strong>general-purpose tool for managing your data</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the TerminusDB content management system, which we will be expanding over the coming months - next step is to provide web accessibility to TerminusHub databases and then a publisher API to provide the ability to publish the results of any query as a static content set.</p>

<h3 id="csv-manager">CSV Manager</h3>

<p>With a single click, you can now build a database from a CSV or a group of CSVs. You can easily use TerminusDB and TerminusHub as a place to version and collaborate when working with CSV data. This will be especially useful with fast changing data as frequently used in machine learning and data science projects.</p>

<p>We have tried to make it as simple as possible for users to interact with the CSV tooling. You can view and edit CSVs directly in the document viewer. You can also add CSVs from this interface. No need to write code.</p>

<p>The database automatically spots if the CSV is already in the database and will just add the delta. There is an append mode that just adds the data that is not there and an update mode that updates the entire CSV.</p>

<p><strong>Manage your CSVs and other data via TerminusDB and Hub.</strong></p>

<h3 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>We are excited to launch the TerminusDB CLI. You can connect to TerminusDB with a Git-like CLI to run queries or use the revision control features.</p>

<p>You can create databases and branches, you can list databases/branches, you can query in the command line and you can load CSVs. You also get full error reporting in the CLI. Use the CLI to import a CSV, commit changes and push the changes to TerminusHub.</p>

<p>The CLI will continue to develop and add new operations. We will make it easier to execute queries directly from the CLI. We’re also planning to launch CLIs for the JavaScript and Python clients.</p>

<p>TerminusDB is a big step towards our ambition to be a complete decentralized data and content management system that is accessible to all.</p>

<p><strong>END</strong></p>

<p>* Star’s End is a reference to the mysterious location of the Second Foundation in the Asimov series of novels. The home of the First Foundation was Terminus.</p>

                    Let's look at a type-directed approach for implementing
                    image processing applications on FPGAs. This approach will
                    enable us to statically verify a design's throughput. If you
                    like this post, check out my PLDI 2020 paper <a href="https://aetherling.org/">Aetherling</a>, which
                    provides a formal definition of the types and uses them
                    to make trade-offs automatically during the FPGA design process.

                    <!--target audience: someone at google who already knows its hard to make stuff fast, not hardware person, knows that apple and google are doing custom hardware (maybe), interested in design choices apple/google would have to make-->
                    <p>
                        Hardware designs on FPGAs offer a different set of
                        performance trade-offs compared to software running on a
                        CPU. Greater parallelism can be achieved on an FPGA by
                        allocating more resources, like adders and multipliers.
                        This is unlike a CPU with a fixed number of cores and
                        vector lanes per cores. However, FPGA have limited
                        resources, so trade-offs must be made between
                        parallelism (or throughput) and resource utilization. In
                        this blog post, we're going to look at the
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs for FPGA
                        implementations of image processing operations like
                        image blurring. There are many ways to blur images on an
                        FPGA. Some designs have higher throughput, and others
                        require fewer resources. I'm going to demonstrate a type
                        system for expressing designs with different
                        throughput-resource tradeoffs that enables you to
                        statically determine a design's throughput.

                            (See below for a refresher on the types of resources
                            available on an FPGA.)

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Before we get to the type system, let's look at a few
                        different ways to blur an image on an FPGA. These
                        designs will have different throughout-resources
                        trade-offs. The below video shows one design that
                        processes one pixel per clock cycle. It does so by
                        streaming over the input pixels, accepting one at a
                        time, storing two prior input pixels in registers, and
                        computing the average of the current input and the prior
                        two.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        Design a in the image below shows the same one pixel per
                        clock design as the above animation. Designs b and c
                        show two other implementations with different
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs. Design b
                        processes two elements per clock, doubling the
                        throughput relative to design a and the animation above.
                        Design b requires double the adders and dividers
                        compared to design a in order to achieve this
                        throughput. Design c saves on adders but can only
                        process one pixel every third clock cycle.

                                    every third clock.  For simplicity, these
                                    designs only do a blur on a 1D image.

                        You could write up all these different designs in
                        Verilog. Assuming you wrote correct code, they would
                        synthesize to a bitstream, run on an FPGA, and provide
                        the expected throughput. But, it would be challenging to
                        statically verify that the designs achieved the correct
                        performance.

                        </a>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that we've seen some different designs, we're ready
                        for the types that encode their throughputs. Since we're
                        building application-specific hardware, we can encode
                        the throughput of the designs down to the clock cycle
                        without complex performance issues common in software
                        like multi-threading. I'm going to introduce these types
                        using a simpler example than blur: <code>map
                        add10</code>. This code adds 10 to each element in an
                        input sequence. When implementing a map on an FPGA,
                        there are two basic implementations. The first
                        implementation, <code>map_s add10</code> (or
                        <code>map</code> in space), is fully parallel and
                        duplicates <code>add10</code>. If the <code>map_s</code>
                        is applied to a sequence of four elements, then four
                        elements arrive on one clock cycle, <code>map_s</code>
                        adds 10 to every element, and the four elements depart
                        on the same clock cycle. The second implementation,
                        <code>map_t add10</code> (or <code>map</code> in time),
                        is fully sequential and requires only one copy of the
                        <code>add10</code> circuit. The four input elements
                        arrive on four separate clocks and <code>map_t</code>
                        adds 10 to one element at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The types of <code>map_s</code> and <code>map_t</code>
                        encode their throughputs. <code>map_s add10 :: SSeq 4
                        int -&gt; SSeq 4 int</code> is a function on two space
                        sequences. Each space sequence (<code>SSeq 4 int</code>)
                        encodes both the length of the sequence and that all the
                        elements occur on the same clock cycle. The type
                        signature of <code>map_s add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on one
                        clock and emits them on one clock. This is a throughput
                        of four <code>int</code>s per clock. <code>map_t add10 :: TSeq 4 0
                        int -&gt; TSeq 4 0 int</code> is a function on two time
                        sequences. Each time sequence (<code>TSeq 4 0 int</code>)
                        encodes that all the elements elements occur on different clocks, one after another. The type
                        signature of <code>map_t add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on separate
                        clocks and emits them on separate clocks. This is a throughput
                        of one <code>int</code> per clock. The fully sequential
                        throughput, like the fully parallel one for <code>map_s
                        add10</code>, is easily expressed using the space-time
                        types.

December 4, 2020 | https://actualbudget.com/blog/porting-local-app-web | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://actualbudget.com/blog/porting-local-app-web">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>While researching <a href="https://actualbudget.com/blog/cursed-caching-curious">a curious caching bug</a>, I got inspired to take another look at how Actual stores data locally on the web. There's some history I need to explain. Years ago, Actual was only going to be a desktop app. That means <em>all</em> of your data is stored locally. No server.</p><p>Then I realized how important mobile is, and that most people don't want to worry about losing their data if they drop their computer in the ocean. A syncing engine was born, and desktop and mobile apps have happily synced their data ever since. A copy is kept on a server so users can login and easily view their data, and if they worry about privacy they can enable <a href="https://actualbudget.com/docs/overview/syncing-across-devices/#end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p><p>In the last year I grew jealous of web apps. Look at how easily they can deploy… how quickly they can drop users right into the app. No install required. Here I am asking users to download an 80MB file just to run the app. That download absolutely kills conversion rates, and makes the login flow, support, a/b testing and <em>everything</em> much harder.</p><p>I love desktop apps because you have access to much better tech (like native sqlite3), the app is super fast (no network calls), and the user owns their data. However, I can't ignore that the benefits of the web <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/">dwarfs these advantages</a>.</p><p>I started thinking about a web version of Actual. After some hacking, <a href="https://app.actualbudget.com/">I got it working</a> without changing the architecture. That means all your data is still stored locally in the browser, and there are no network calls. It's a completely 100% "local" app in the browser [0].</p><p>I haven't marketed the web version much because it hasn't been tested enough, and it needs improvements like lazy loading code to make it load faster. The biggest thing I'm worried about is the data storage layer. Since <strong>all your data is local</strong>, if something goes wrong there you could potentially lose data. And we're really stressing the browser's persistant db by storing everything in it.</p><p>To be clear: <strong>we are not deprecating the desktop version</strong>. However in the future the web version will be the primary platform, with the choice to download the desktop version if desired.</p><p>The way it works a bit unusual. Here's a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>Actual uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a>. This is a hard requirement. The app runs tons of complex SQL queries to aggregate financial data and it's so good at doing it. Queries are easy to express and run super fast.</li><li>On desktop and mobile, native sqlite3 is used. The web does not support sqlite3, however. To get around this, Actual uses a <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">wasm version</a> of sqlite3 and creates an in-memory db.</li><li>The obvious problem is persistence. When you make changes, we need to persist them somewhere so when the user reloads they don't lose their data. Luckily we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#State-based_CRDTs">state-based CRDT's</a> and all updates come through as a list of "messages". If you are online, these messages get synced to our server so when you reload, all your data should sync up.</li><li>It's not ideal to require a big sync every time you open the app though. Also, if you are offline there shouldn't be any chance of losing data. To solve this, Actual persists each message into IndexedDB. When the app opens, it applies all messages from the local IndexedDB to get up-to-date.</li><li>It's <em>still</em> not ideal to require applying any messages on load. It won't scale - if you use the app for months you'll accumulate tens of thousands of messages. IndexedDB would grow indefinitely and loading the app would get slower. To solve this, when the stored messages crosses a threshold it flushes the entire sqlite3 db to IndexedDB and clears all the messages.</li><li>That means both a binary representation of the sqlite3 db and a list of messages is persisted in IndexedDB. On load, the app creates the in-memory sqlite3 db from the snapshot and applies any remaining messages from IDB.</li></ul><p>Turns out this is similar to how a <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead log</a> works.</p><p>I was worried about the reliability of IndexedDB. Reading the docs it seems like browsers might delete databases as needed, but in practice this doesn't seem to happen [1]. It's probably a much bigger problem on mobile where memory is scarce, but I don't mess with the mobile web (use a native app instead). I was also worried about hitting the limit of IDB storage, but as explained next that hasn't been a problem.</p><p>This technique started as an experiment, but it has worked surprisingly well. I have 5 years worth of data in Actual, and the size of the sqlite3 db is 9.7MB. The threshold of the messages table is around 50KB, so in total I'm storing ~10MB in IndexedDB for a user who's been around for 5 years. It's not even close to hitting the IndexedDB max storage limit, which these days is at least 500MB.</p><p>While it has worked so far, I want to be 100% confident in this approach. I've been digging deep into how each browser stores IndexedDB data on disk and discovered a couple improvements I can make. I was going to write about them in this post, but I ended up writing more about the overall approach. In the next post I'll dig deep into how IndexedDB works across browsers.</p><p>[0] While I didn't talk about it in this post, this also means that the entire app runs in the browser. The "backend" runs in a background worker thread and everything happens locally.</p><p>[1] If the local data does somehow get corrupted or deleted, it's not a <em>huge</em> deal. All changes are still sent off and stored on a server (which is how all other devices get synced). If something goes wrong, the app can re-download your data from the server. The only case where you'd lose data is if you were offline and lost your local data, which is to be expected.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
  <strong>﻿By Mikko Haapoja and Stephan Leroux</strong>
</p>
<p>
  2020 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) is over, and another BFCM Globe has
  shipped. We’re extremely proud of the globe, it focused on realism,
  performance, and the impact our merchants have on the world.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPm0xjr2lzo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>The Black Friday Cyber Monday Live Map</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We knew we had a tall task in front of us this year, building something that
  could represent orders from our one million merchants in just two months. Not
  only that, we wanted to ship a data visualization for our merchants so they
  could have a similar experience to the BFCM globe every day in their Live
  View.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_r6ut_Z7pss?playlist=_r6ut_Z7pss&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>Prototypes for the 2020 BFCM Globe and Live View. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With tight timelines and an ambitious initiative, we immediately jumped into
  prototypes with three.js and planned our architecture.
</p>

<p>
  As we planned this project, we converged architecturally on the idea of
  layers. Each layer is similar to a React component where state is minimally
  shared with the rest of the application, and each layer encapsulates its own
  functionality. This allowed for code reuse and flexibility to build both the
  Live View Globe, BFCM Globe, and beyond.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D56O11Y46o0?playlist=D56O11Y46o0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>A showcase of layers for the 2020 BFCM Globe. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  When realism is key, it’s always best to lean on fantastic artists, and that’s
  where
  <a href="https://twitter.com/byrondelgado" target="_blank" title="Byron Delgado on Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Byron Delgado</a>
  came in. We hoped that Byron would be able to use the 3D modeling tools he’s
  used to, and then we would incorporate his 3D models into our experience. This
  is where the <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer comes in.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4oeDV4rNQo?playlist=N4oeDV4rNQo&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>
    <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer from the 2020 BFCM Globe. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <code>EarthRealistic</code> uses a technique called physically based
  rendering, which most modern 3D modeling software supports. In three.js,
  physically based rendering is implemented via the
  <code>MeshPhysicalMaterial</code> or
  <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code> materials.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve realistic lighting, <code>EarthRealistic</code> is lit by a 32bit
  EXR Environment Map. By using a 32bit EXR, it means we can have smooth image
  based lighting. Image based lighting is a technique where a “360 sphere” is
  created around the 3D scene, and pixels in that image are used to calculate
  how bright Triangles on 3D models should be. This allows for complex lighting
  setups without much effort from an artist. Traditionally images on the web
  such as JPGs and PNGs have a color depth of 8bits. If we were to use these
  formats and 8bit color depth, our globe lighting would have had horrible
  gradient banding, missing realism entirely.
</p>

<p>
  Once we converged on physically based rendering and image based lighting,
  building the carbon offset layer became clearer. Literally!
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  Bubbles have an interesting phenomenon where they can be almost opaque at a
  certain angle and light intensity but in other areas completely transparent.
  To achieve this look, we created a custom material based on
  MeshStandardMaterial that reads in an Environment Map and simulates the bubble
  lighting phenomenon. The following is the easiest way to achieve this with
  three.js:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a custom Material class that extends off of MeshStandardMaterial.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and define any Uniforms for that
    Shader Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Override
    <code>onBeforeCompile(shader: Shader, _renderer: WebGLRenderer): void&nbsp;</code>on your custom Material and pass the custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and
    uniforms via the Shader instance.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here’s our implementation of the above for the Carbon Offset Shield Material:
</p>
<ul>

    - Abstraction on top of MeshStandardMaterial
  </li>

    - Custom Fragment shaders that make MeshStandardMaterial look like a bubble
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let’s look at the above, starting with our Fragment shader. In shield.frag
  lines 94-97
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  These two lines are all that are needed to achieve a bubble effect in a
  fragment shader.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the <code>brightness</code> of an rgb pixel, you calculate the
  length or magnitude of the pixel using the GLSL length function. In three.js
  shaders, <code>outgoingLight</code> is an RGB <code>vec3</code> representing
  the outgoing light or pixel to be rendered.
</p>
<p>
  If you remember from earlier, the bubble’s brightness determines how
  transparent or opaque it should appear.&nbsp; After calculating brightness, we can
  set the outgoing pixel’s alpha based on the brightness calculation. Here we
  use the GLSL <code>mix</code> function to go between the expected alpha of the
  pixel defined by <code>diffuseColor.a</code> and a new custom uniform defined
  as <code>maxOpacity</code>. By having the concept of min or expected opacity
  and max opacity, Byron and other artists can tweak visuals to their exact
  liking.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at our shield.frag file, it may seem daunting! What on earth is
  all of this code?&nbsp; three.js materials handle a lot of functionality, so it’s
  best to make small additions and not modify existing code. three.js materials
  all have their own shaders defined in the
  <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/" target="_blank" title="ShaderLib folder in three.js repo" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShaderLib folder</a>. To extend a three.js material, you can grab the original material shader
  code from the <code>src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/</code> folder in the
  three.js repo and perform any custom calculations before setting
  <code>gl_FragColor</code>. An easier option to access three.js shader code is
  to simply <code>console.log</code> the <code>shader.fragmentShader</code> or
  <code>shader.vertexShader</code> strings, which are exposed in the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function:
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> runs immediately before the Shader Program is
  created on the GPU. Here you can override shaders and uniforms.
  CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts is an abstraction we wrote to make creating
  custom materials easier. It overrides the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function and manages uniforms while your
  application runs via the
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5a0c15b0c83ed00b66267b93994714cf#file-custommeshstandardmaterial-ts-L51" target="_blank" title="setCustomUniform in CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>setCustomUniform</code></a>
  and

  functions. You can see this in action in our custom Shield Material when
  getting and setting <code>maxOpacity</code>:

<h2>Using Particles to Display Orders</h2>

    Displaying orders on Shopify from across the world using particles. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  One of the BFCM globe’s main features is the ability to view orders happening
  in real-time from our merchants and their buyers worldwide. Given Shopify’s
  scale and amount of orders happening during BFCM, it’s challenging to visually
  represent all of the orders happening at any given time. We wanted to find a
  way to showcase the sheer volume of orders our merchants receive over this
  time in both a visually compelling and performant way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the past, we used visual “arcs” to display the connection between a buyer’s
  and a merchant’s location.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787">
  <figcaption>
    The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With thousands of orders happening every minute, using arcs alone to represent
  every order quickly became a visual mess along with a heavy decrease in
  framerate. One solution was to cap the number of arcs we display, but this
  would only allow us to display a small fraction of the orders we were
  processing. Instead, we investigated using a particle-based solution to help
  fill the gap.
</p>
<p>With particles, we wanted to see if we could:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle thousands of orders at any given time on screen.</li>
  <li>Maintain 60 frames per second on low-end devices.</li>
  <li>
    Have the ability to customize style and animations per order, such as
    visualizing local and international orders.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  From the start, we figured that rendering geometry per an order wouldn't scale
  well if we wanted to have thousands of orders on screen. Particles appear on
  the globe as highlights, so they don’t necessarily need to have a 3D
  perspective. Rather than using triangles for each particle, we began our
  investigation using three.js <code>Points</code> as a start, which allowed us
  to draw using dots instead. Next, we needed an efficient way to store data for
  each particle we wanted to render. Using <code>BufferGeometry</code>, we
  assigned custom attributes that contained all the information we needed for
  each particle/order.
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  To render the points and make use of our attributes, we created a
  <code>ShaderMaterial</code>, and custom vertex and fragment shaders. Most of
  the magic for rendering and animating the particles happens inside the vertex
  shader. Each particle defined in the attributes we pass to our
  <code>BufferGeometry</code> goes through a series of steps and
  transformations.
</p>
<p>
  First, each particle has a starting and ending location described using
  latitude and longitude. Since we want the particle to travel along the surface
  and not through it, we use a geo interpolation function on our coordinates to
  find a path that goes along the surface.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with an order represented as a particle traveling from New York City to London. The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines the path it needs to travel." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616">

    The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines
    the path it needs to travel. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Next, to give the particle height along its path, we use high school geometry,
  a parabola equation based on time to alter the straight path to a curve.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with particles that follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a parabola equation to determine its height." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702">
  <figcaption>

    parabola equation to determine its height. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To render the particle to make it look 3D in its travels, we combine our
  height and projected path data then convert it to a vector position our shader
  uses as it’s <code>gl_Position</code>. With our particle now knowing where it
  needs to go, using a <code>time</code> uniform, we drive animations for other
  changes such as size and color. At the end of the vertex shader, we pass the
  position and point size to render onto the fragment shader that combines the
  calculated color and alpha at the time for each particle.

                    <p>As a privacy friendly company who work mainly with newsletters, we spend a lot of time thinking about the ethics of email. </p><p>We've recently been working on a sort of "code of ethics" for email senders who are interested in privacy, and after getting a lot of feedback have condensed our main points down to the following. This is still a work in progress (and in some places <em>highly</em> subjective), so if you have any feedback at all then please raise a ticket on the <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto">GitHub repo</a>, or leave a comment on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25303911">Hacker News discussion</a>. </p><p>Let's start off with a simple one. Above all else, recurring emails should be opt-in. If I receive an email from you it <strong><em>should not be a surprise</em></strong>.</p><p>In real terms this means;</p><ul><li>For newsletter creators, if someone signed up for your monthly newsletter, then don't sometimes send them weekly without asking.</li><li>For app makers and SaaS, a welcome email is okay, but don't automatically add a new customer to your automated Drip campaign of 25 on-boarding emails.</li></ul><p>This really is a no-brainer and benefits everyone. If you send emails that people don't expect, you make them angry and more likely to mark you as spam, hurting your reputation.</p><p>I've spoken about this before, letting your recipients easily unsubscribe from emails helps to maintain a healthy mailing list. But lets go one step further...</p><p>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox <strong>should be treated as a privilege</strong>, and we should respect their right to easily deny us that permission at any time and for any reason.</p><p>This means we must provide an unsubscribe link within each email that is accessible to the recipient, this link should ideally unsubscribe in <em>one-click</em> and not require any additional steps.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox should be treated as a privilege</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The best way to do this is to provide an "unsubscribe" link in the email body. This should be clear and purposeful by;</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Using clear language
<ul>
<li>"Click here to unsubscribe" is good</li>
<li>"Manage your preferences here" is not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being accessible
<ul>
<li>Make your unsubscribe link obvious</li>
<li>Keep the contrast ratio high - eg don't use light grey text on a white background. This is not cool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If possible, it's also good to provide a machine-readable <code>List-Unsubscribe</code> header with every email (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2369.txt">RFC 2369</a>). This allows automated tools to help your recipients unsubscribe. The URL in the List-Unsubscribe can be the same as the one you use in your unsubscribe link in the email body.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>List-Unsubscribe: 
    &lt;http://www.host.com/list.cgi?cmd=unsub&amp;lst=list&gt;,
    &lt;mailto:<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="eb8782989fc6998e9a9e8e989fab8384989fc5888486">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>?subject=unsubscribe&gt;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In case this doesn't go without saying, if a recipient unsubscribes from your mailing list then you should not send them any more emails from that address!</p><p>P.S. Recently I've seen more mailing lists including an unsubscribe link at the top of the email as well as at the bottom. This seems like a great idea.</p><p>There should be no doubt why someone is receiving your email, or how frequently they should expect it. It sucks to receive an email but not know why.</p><p>I understand that recipients may forget that they signed up for your service or to receive your newsletter (especially if it is not sent frequently), so make the intent of the email clear at the start. For example, by leading the content with the sentence "You are receiving this email because you signed up for an account on example.com".</p><p>Newsletter creators, if you sent emails on a schedule then let your recipient know when they will receive your next email.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>Here's how we manage this in some of our recurring emails</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There's also an email header for this as well, the <code>List-Help</code> header. This provides a place to discover more information about the mailing list.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>List-Help: &lt;http://www.host.com/list/&gt;, &lt;mailto:<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9af6f3e9eeb7f3f4fcf5daf2f5e9eeb4f9f5f7">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Probably the most controversial point I need to make - emails should not contain spy-pixels/pixel-trackers or any other mechanism that measures open-rates.</p><p>I know it's nice to see how many people are opening your emails, but since this tracking can be done without the consent of the recipient, it should be considered a violation of privacy. Requiring recipients to disable images in their email client in order to not be tracked is <strong>not </strong>acceptable.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>Read tracking can be crazy intrusive (image courtesy of the SuperHuman exposé last year)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you wish to see if recipients are engaging with your emails, then provide actionable elements for them. For example, clicking a link in the email is easily measurable, shows engagement, and is less intrusive.</p><p>Ideally, I think it would be nice to return to mainly plaintext emails, with a few embedded images here and there. Embedded images don't have to be fetched from an external server, and thus can't be used for tracking purposes. I <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings/status/1334796362416877569">tweeted some info</a> on how to embed images recently if you want more info on this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>I think these 4 points cover most shady email practices, a good start!</p><p>None of this is governed by any specific law, but a bunch of it probably falls under either CAN-SPAM or GDPR email regulations. </p><p>That said, governments have been consistently slow to react with regards to protecting online privacy and barely enforce any protections they have managed to pass. So I think the best way forward is encourage email senders to act ethically, and as consumers, point out ethical violations and not do business with those who do not meet our standards wherever possible.</p><p>There's a long way to go in this space, and I want to explore it in the open with as much feedback as possible. My first draft of an <em>Ethical Email Manifesto</em> that we will be following at my company is <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto">public on GitHub</a> and open to contributions.</p><p>If you want to support this movement and tell the world you're an "ethical email sender", then <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto/issues">open an issue</a> and we'll add your company as a signatory to the document ❤</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Agree (or disagree) with me about any of this? Jump on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25303911">HN thread</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I post a lot about shady email practices.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>For authors, deciding between Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP is not always a straightforward answer. </p>



<p>I’ve been a huge advocate of Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) for several years now, and most of my books are published on that platform. </p>



<p>However, I decided to self publish my latest book on Gumroad, and I wanted to share my thoughts about which one I think is best for authors.</p>



<p>I have also gathered some insights from other authors who have used one or both platforms.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Quick Summary</h2>



<p>This is a <em>really </em>long post (3,900+ words, which will take you around 17 minutes to read), so here’s the TL;DR version if you don’t have a lot of time:</p>



<p>Both Amazon and Gumroad have some advantages and disadvantages for authors. And what works best depends on your objective and on your current situation.</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>maximize profits</strong>, already have a <strong>fairly large audience</strong>, and <strong>have the time and energy</strong> to direct traffic to your book, then <strong>Gumroad </strong>is the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you care more about <strong>brand value</strong>, have a <strong>smaller audience</strong>, and want to <strong>rely more on organic traffic/ reach</strong> for readers to find your book, then <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> is the best option for you.</p>



<p>You can, of course, publish on both platforms at the same time, but there are some considerations that you have to factor in.</p>



<p>Here are some more details about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and which one wins in each category.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Fees &amp; Royalties</h2>



<p>Let’s start with a foundational question. What are the fees you have to pay and royalties (i.e. profit margins) you get on each platform?</p>



<h3>Amazon KDP</h3>



<p>With Amazon, you can publish your book for free (i.e. there are no listing fees), and there are no monthly fees. Your royalties fall between <strong>35%</strong> and <strong>70%</strong>, depending on the book’s price point. </p>



<p>If you list your book’s price between <strong>$2.99</strong> and <strong>$9.99</strong>, then you’ll get a <strong>70%</strong> royalty (i.e., your profit is 70% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>However, if you list your book’s price between<strong> $0.99 </strong>(lowest price allowed) and <strong>$2.99 </strong>or between<strong> $9.99</strong> and <strong>$200.00</strong> (highest price allowed), then you’ll get a <strong>35%</strong> royalty (i.e., you only get paid 35% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>In other words, Amazon tries to incentivize you to price your book between <strong>$2.99 and $9.99</strong> because that’s a sweet spot for sales. </p>



<p><em>Note: This applies to the ebook (i.e. Kindle) version of your book’s price point. The paperback version on Amazon has a different royalty structure.</em><br></p>



<h3>Gumroad</h3>



<p>With Gumroad, you have two options to publish your book. You can do it for free (i.e. no monthly fees), or you can upgrade to a premium account that costs you $10 per month (or $108 per year).</p>



<p>Upgrading to a premium account gives you a few advantages that you can read about <a href="https://gumroad.com/features/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of fees, you pay an <strong>8.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the free account, and <strong>3.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the premium account.</p>



<p>In other words, your royalty will be between approximately <strong>91% and 96%</strong> of your book’s price point (which is much higher than Amazon’s <strong>35% to 70%</strong>). </p>



<p>So Gumroad definitely wins here.</p>



<p>Another important factor that plays in Gumroad’s favor is “price anchoring.” Given that Amazon persuades authors to price their book between $2.99 and $9.99, most books are listed within that range, which makes it’s very hard to justify selling a $47 Kindle ebook.</p>



<p>Gumroad doesn’t have that problem.</p>



<h4><strong>Winner</strong>: <strong>Gumroad</strong></h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: eBook Formats</h2>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Amazon, you have to meet their specific guidelines because Amazon converts your book into their proprietary ebook file format. You can format your book using Microsoft Word or by using Amazon’s own tool called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18292298011">Kindle Create</a>.” </p>



<p>You can also submit other formats, such as PDF, but those end up causing some formatting challenges when they’re converted to Kindle-specific files.</p>



<p>The way your readers read your Kindle book is either on a Kindle device (e.g., a Kindle Fire Tablet or a Kindle Paperwhite) or on a free Kindle app installed on any other device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android phone, computer, etc.). </p>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Gumroad, you basically upload whatever file format your readers will end up downloading. You can also upload multiple files of the same book.</p>



<p>For example, you might want to offer your book in PDF format only.  Or you might want to offer it in PDF, MOBI, ePUB, and HTML. Gumroad basically acts as a document repository and you can upload the same files that you want your customers to view.</p>



<p><em>Note: If you want your Gumroad customers to be able to read your book on their Kindle devices, then make sure you upload the Kindle-friendly MOBI version of your book.</em></p>



<p>Gumroad wins in this category because of the file format flexibility. </p>



<p>For example, I’m writing a new book about <a href="https://www.thecouchmanager.com/home-office-book-launch">how to design a home office</a> and because it’s picture heavy (and the layout needs tweaking) the best format that will work for me is PDF.</p>



<p>And because I wouldn’t be able to do replicate that layout in Amazon without some serious design challenges, I’ll be selling that book exclusively on Gumroad.</p>



<h4>Winner: Gumroad</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Paperback Copies</h2>



<p>Most authors want to (and probably should) sell paperback copies of their book. That’s because some readers still prefer to hold physical copies of books, and it would be a mistake to ignore that potential revenue stream.</p>



<p>Here’s a recent screenshot of revenue from my books. Notice the difference between the ebook and paperback royalties.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="871" height="290" src="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="Amazon ebook royalty vs. paperback royalty" srcset="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 871w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x100.png 300w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px"></figure>



<p>With Amazon, creating a paperback version of your book is very simple. You’ll need to convert your manuscript to a print-ready file (easy to do within Amazon KDP) and then upload a print-ready cover (that you’ll need to have designed).</p>



<p>After you publish, Amazon then simply prints your book as soon as someone orders it (called POD, which stands for print-on-demand) and ships it to them. So you don’t have to worry about inventory or paying for print copies upfront.</p>



<p>Gumroad unfortunately does not provide any of those print-on-demand capabilities, which means that you will not be able to sell any paperback copies of your book.</p>



<p>The only potential alternative is to do this manually by pre-printing copies of your book yourself and then physically sell &amp; ship them when someone makes an order (not very practical, and not very cheap). </p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Organic Reach</h2>



<p>Organic reach is about how people find your book and how effectively each platform recommends it. </p>



<p>With Amazon, over <strong>95%</strong> of my book sales come from organic sales. In other words, it’s mostly from Amazon’s own algorithm. I don’t get a lot of sales from my own efforts of directing people to buy my books. </p>



<p><em>Note: Amazon does not disclose any data about statistics or traffic sources, so I couldn’t give you exact numbers. However, I do track my own sales channels through affiliate links to my books, and that’s why I can estimate organic sales at around 95%.</em></p>



<p>With Gumroad, it’s almost the exact opposite. For sales of my last book, only around <strong>7%</strong> of the sales came in from Gumroad’s organic reach, and <strong>93%</strong> came from my own direct efforts, so I have to do a lot more marketing to sell those books. </p>



<p>So for me, Amazon wins because of three reasons. </p>



<p>First, I can depend a bit more on sales as passive income and I don’t have to constantly market my books.</p>



<p>Second, the volume of readers and traffic on Amazon is much higher than the volume on Gumroad.</p>



<p>Third, Amazon has a sophisticated search algorithm that recommends books to readers based on recent events or on their search/ purchase history.</p>



<p>And all three factors converged for me during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>I wrote a book around 6 years ago (called “<em><a href="https://amzn.to/2EAeP7I">Influencing Virtual Teams</a></em>“) and it was making around $200 a month. Then, during the pandemic, there was a sudden spike in interest about remote work, and the book ended up making 10X that amount in a couple of those months. </p>



<p>Although Amazon wins in this category, I do have to give Gumroad two advantages here. First, they are open about their sales sources, so I can get much better statistics. And second, I made over <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/final-results-3294usd-in-30-days-from-the-book-part-9/">$3,294 in sales in one month</a> from one book, so the higher price-point of the book could pay off for you.</p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Reader Emails</h2>



<p>An essential feature for authors is the ability to collect emails from their customers. There are many reasons why, but in summary, it’s to be able to stay in touch with readers and build a relationship with them so you can sell other books (or products/ services) down the line. </p>



<p>Amazon does not give authors the capability to view any of those email addresses. In fact, authors have absolutely no visibility about who their customers are. There is a workaround, where authors can offer customers a freebie in exchange for their email address, but that takes <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/how-to-collect-email-addresses-from-readers/">a bit of effort to set up</a>, and you’ll still not capture 100% of your customers.</p>



<p>Gumroad not only gives you your customers’ information (including email addresses), but it also allows you to communicate with them through Gumroad’s email messaging system directly. You can even export those email addresses and import them into your email management system (such as <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/aweber" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWeber</a>) if you’d like to. So it’s a no brainer that Gumroad wins here.</p>











<h2>Gumroad vs Amazon KDP: Listing Your Book for Free</h2>



<p>Some authors like the idea of offering one or more of their books for free to help them with branding and even making <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/ep-025-getting-200x-more-downloads-by-offering-your-book-for-free/">money indirectly</a>. </p>



<p>With Amazon, you can list your book for free on a limited basis only (for 5 days every 90 day period if you’re enrolled in <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/select" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KDP Select</a>).  You can also list it as a “Permanently Free” book, but that’s not a simple process.</p>



<p>However, if you are able to list your book for free on Amazon, you’ll get the advantage of the high volume of traffic. I listed one of my books …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

  <p>Although governed by simple physical laws, power grids are among the most complex human-made systems.
The main source of the complexity is the large number of components of the power systems that interact with each other: one needs to maintain a balance between power injections and withdrawals while satisfying certain physical, economic, and environmental conditions.
For instance, a central task of daily planning and operations of electricity grid operators<sup id="fnref:Tong04" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Tong04">1</a></sup> is to dispatch generation in order to meet demand at minimum cost, while respecting reliability and security constraints.
These tasks require solving a challenging constrained optimization problem, often referred to as some form of optimal power flow (OPF).<sup id="fnref:Cain12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Cain12">2</a></sup></p>

<div><p>In a series of two blog posts, we are going to discuss the basics of power flow and optimal power flow problems.
In this first post, we focus on the most important component of OPF: the power flow (PF) equations.
For this, first we introduce some basic definitions of power grids and AC circuits, then we define the power flow problem.
</p></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/us_power_grid.jpg" alt="us_power_grid">

<h2 id="power-grids-as-graphs">Power grids as graphs</h2>

<p>Power grids are networks that include two main components: buses that represent important locations of the grid (e.g. generation points, load points, substations) and transmission (or distribution) lines that connect these buses.
It is pretty straightforward, therefore, to look at power grid networks as graphs: buses and transmission lines can be represented by nodes and edges of a corresponding graph.
There are two equivalent graph models that can be used to derive the basic power flow equations<sup id="fnref:Low14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>directed graph representation (left panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{D}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E})\);</li>
  <li>undirected graph representation (right panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{U}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{E}^{R})\),</li>
</ul>

<div><p>where \(\mathcal{N}\), \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{E}^{R} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) denote the set of nodes (buses), and the forward and reverse orientations of directed edges (branches) of the graph, respectively.
</p></div>

<h2 id="complex-power-in-ac-circuits">Complex power in AC circuits</h2>

<p>Power can be transmitted more efficiently at high voltages as high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a> (or equivalently, low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current">current</a>) reduces the loss of power due to its dissipation on transmission lines.
Power grids generally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current">alternating current</a> (AC) since the AC voltage can be altered (from high to low) easily via transformers.
Therefore, we start with some notation and definitions for AC circuits.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of AC circuits is that, unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current">direct current</a> (DC) circuits, the currents and voltages are not constant in time: both their <em>magnitude</em> and <em>direction</em> vary periodically.
Because of several technical reasons (like low losses and disturbances), power generators use sinusoidal alternating quantities that can be straightforwardly modeled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number%7D%7Bcomplex%20numbers">complex numbers</a>.</p>

<p>We will consistently use capital and small letters to denote complex and real-valued quantities, respectively.
For instance, let us consider two buses, \(i, j \in \mathcal{N}\), that are directly connected by a transmission line \((i, j) \in \mathcal{E}\).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">complex power</a> flowing from bus \(i\) to bus \(j\) is denoted by \(S_{ij}\) and it can be decomposed into its active (\(p_{ij}\)) and reactive (\(q_{ij}\)) components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = p_{ij} + \mathrm{j}q_{ij},
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}\).
The complex power flow can be expressed as the product of the complex voltage at bus \(i\), \(V_{i}\) and the complex conjugate of the current flowing between the buses, \(I_{ij}^{*}\):</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = V_{i}I_{ij}^{*},
\label{power_flow}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>It is well known that transmission lines have power losses due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">resistance</a> (\(r_{ij}\)), which is a measure of the opposition to the flow of the current.
For AC-circuits, a dynamic effect caused by the line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance">reactance</a> (\(x_{ij}\)) also plays a role.
Unlike resistance, reactance does not cause any loss of power but has a delayed effect by storing and later returning power to the circuit.
The effect of resistance and reactance together can be represented by a single complex quantity, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">impedance</a>: \(Z_{ij} = r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}\). 
Another useful complex quantity is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance">admittance</a>, which is the reciprocal of the impedance: \(Y_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\).
Similarly to the impedance, the admittance can be also decomposed into its real, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">conductance</a> (\(g_{ij}\)), and imaginary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance">susceptance</a> (\(b_{ij}\)), components: \(Y_{ij} = g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\).</p>

<p>Therefore, the current can be written as a function of the line voltage drop and the admittance between the two buses, which is an alternative form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm’s law</a>:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
I_{ij} = Y_{ij}(V_{i} - V_{j}).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Replacing the above expression for the current in the power flow equation (eq. \(\ref{power_flow}\)), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{i}^{*} - Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{j}^{*} = Y_{ij}^{*} \left( |V_{i}|^{2} - V_{i}V_{j}^{*} \right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>The above power flow equation can be expressed by using the polar form of voltage, i.e. \(V_{i} = v_{i}e^{\mathrm{j} \delta_{i}} = v_{i}(\cos\delta_{i} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{i})\) (where \(v_{i}\) and \(\delta_{i}\) are the voltage magnitude and angle of bus \(i\), respectively), and the admittance components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \left(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\right) \left(v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right),
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where for brevity we introduced the voltage angle difference \(\delta_{ij} = \delta_{i} - \delta_{j}\).
Similarly, using a simple algebraic identity of \(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij} = \frac{g_{ij}^{2} + b_{ij}^{2}}{g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}} = \frac{|Y_{ij}|^{2}}{Y_{ij}} = \frac{Z_{ij}}{|Z_{ij}|^{2}} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}}\), the impedance components-based expression has the following form:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    S_{ij} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Finally, the corresponding real equations can be written as</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = g_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - b_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = b_{ij} \left( -v_{i}^{2} + v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - g_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right), \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_y}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ r_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + x_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right] \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ x_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + r_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right]. \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_z}
\end{equation}\]

</p><h2 id="power-flow-models">Power flow models</h2>

<p>In the previous section we presented the power flow between two connected buses and established a relationship between complex power flow and complex voltages.
In power flow problems, the entire power grid is considered and the task is to calculate certain quantities based on some other specified ones.
There are two equivalent power flow models depending on the graph model used: the bus injection model (based on the undirected graph representation) and the branch flow model (based on the directed graph representation).
First, we introduce the basic formulations.
Then, we show the most widely used technique to solve power flow problems.
Finally, we extend the basic equations and derive more sophisticated models including additional components for real power grids.</p>

<h3 id="bus-injection-model">Bus injection model</h3>

<p>The bus injection model (BIM) uses the undirected graph model of the power grid, \(\mathbb{G}_{U}\).
For each bus \(i\), we denote by \(\mathcal{N}_{i} \subset \mathcal{N}\) the set of buses directly connected to bus \(i\).
Also, for each bus we introduce the following quantities<sup id="fnref:Low14:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:Wood14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Wood14">4</a></sup> (Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\): generated power flowing into bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\): demand power or load flowing out of the bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}\): net power injection at bus \(i\), i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\): transmitted power flowing between bus \(i\) and its adjacent buses.
</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellegen/%27s_theorem">Tellegen’s theorem</a> establishes a simple relationship between these power quantities:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} \ \ \ \ \forall i \in \mathcal{N}.
\label{power_balance}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Eq. \(\ref{power_balance}\) expresses the law of conservation of power (energy): the power injected (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) to bus \(i\) must be equal to the power going out from the bus, i.e. the sum of the withdrawn (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)) and transmitted power (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\)).
In the most basic model, a bus can represent either a generator (i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) or a load (i.e. \(S_{i} = -S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)).
For a given bus, the transmitted power can be obtained simply as a sum of the powers flowing in to and out from the bus, \(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} = \sum \limits_{j \in …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Mannequin.js</strong> is a simple library of an articulated mannequin figure. The shape of the figure
and its movements are done purely in JavaScript. The graphics is implemented in
<a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Click on an image to open a live demo.</p>

<p>This is the fourth incarnation of the mannequin figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js and is a direct predecessor of the current mannequin.js.
Since its first incarnation, mannequin.js is used in the course <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</em> for Computer Sciences undergraduate students from the
<a href="https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en">Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics</a>
at <a href="https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng">Sofia University</a>.</p>

<p>Mannequin.js is licensed under <strong>GPL-3.0</strong>.</p>

<p>Three.js is included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities with future versions. Three.js is not a part of mannequin.js.</p>



<p>The <strong>mannequin.js</strong> library is provided as a JavaScript file that has to
be include along with three.js.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-program">Minimal program</h3>

<p>Here is a minimal program that creates a male figure in the browser (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-minimal.html">live example</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"three.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"mannequin.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
      createScene();
      var man = new Male();
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The helper function <code>createScene()</code> provides a default set-up of the scene and its elements, like lighting, camera, ground, etc. Another helper function, <code>animate(t)</code> is responsible for defining figures’ postures at moment <em>t</em>. If the set-up is done with a custom function, then it should also manage the animation loop by itself.</p>

<h3 id="figure-types">Figure types</h3>

<p>Mannequin figures are created as instances of classes <code>Male()</code>, <code>Female()</code> or <code>Child()</code> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-figure-types.jpg"></a></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>man</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Male</span><span>();</span>
    <span>man</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>3.5</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>man</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>120</span><span>);</span>
    <span>:</span>
<span>var</span> <span>woman</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Female</span><span>();</span>
    <span>woman</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>woman</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
    <span>:</span>
<span>var</span> <span>kid</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>();</span>
    <span>kid</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>8</span><span>;</span>
    <span>kid</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
    <span>:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These three classes have a common predecessor – the class <code>Mannequin(feminine,height)</code>, where <em>feminine</em> is boolean and defines whether the shape is feminine or masculine, and the second parameter is a number for relative height (adults have height 1).</p>



<p>All types of figures have the same structure of joints. For example, the right arm of a figure is accessed by <code>r_arm</code>. Left and right body parts are in respect to the figure, not to the viewer (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-body-parts.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Each body part has rotation methods that turn it around a pivot point.
The first parameter <em>angle</em> of the methods is the angle of rotation in degrees,
so 180 is half turn and 360 is full turn. Negative angles are allowed and
they represent turning in the opposite direction. Some methods have an optional
second parameter for <em>direction</em> of motion, which could be the constant <code>LEFT</code> or
<code>RIGHT</code>.</p>

<h3 id="central-body-parts">Central body parts</h3>

<p>The central body parts are the ones which have single instances - <em>head</em>, <em>neck</em>, <em>torso</em>, <em>pelvis</em> and the body as a whole. To move the whole <strong>body</strong> use methods <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> of the figure (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>head</strong> supports similar methods: <em>nod</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-head.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.head.nod ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle, dir )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle, dir )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>torso</strong> has the same methods as the whole body: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-torso.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.torso.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the <strong>neck</strong> is a separate part of the body, it is not controlled individually. Instead, a part of the head motion is distributed over the neck. Similarly, the <strong>pelvis</strong> is not controlled individually. Instead, the whole body is controlled by bending, turning and tilting.</p>

<h3 id="upper-limbs">Upper limbs</h3>

<p>The upper limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>arm</em>, <em>elbow</em>, <em>wrist</em> and <em>fingers</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>arms</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm1.html">live example</a>). The following list refers to the right arm, however, the same methods are available for the right hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the <em>direction</em> parameter is omitted, then the default motions of <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> are symmetrical. For example, the left arm is straddled to the left, while the right arm is straddled to the right (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm2.html">live example</a>).</p>

<p>The motion of the <strong>elbow</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-elbow.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural elbow position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_elbow.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>wrists</strong> have the same methods as the torso: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-wrist.html">live example</a>), but similar to the arms, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The last body parts of the upper limbs are the <strong>fingers</strong>. They can only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-fingers.html">live example</a>), however, they are composed of two segments and the bending angle is distributed over both of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_fingers.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lower-limbs">Lower limbs</h3>

<p>The lower limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>leg</em>, <em>knee</em> and <em>ankle</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>legs</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-leg.html">live example</a>). Straddling and turning are symmetrical if <em>direction</em> is not set.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The motion of the <strong>knee</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-knee.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural knee position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_knee.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ankles</strong> have the same methods as the wrists: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-ankle.html">live example</a>), but similar to the legs, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>



<p>The posture of a figure is defined by a setting the rotations of body parts. The order of rotations is fixed independent on the order of rotations in the user program (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-order.html">live example</a>). For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>produces the same posture as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes this might lead to unexpected results, especially if the user assumes an order of rotations that is different from what mannequin.js uses. This might happen when a body part is rotated around 3 or 2 axes.</p>

<h3 id="static-posture">Static posture</h3>

<p>The static posture defines the position of body part that do not change. By default, when a figure is created, its body parts are set to the default posture. This version of mannequin.js does not provide posture editor, so all rotations has to be defined programmatically.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-posture.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to define the figure step by step. Tai Chi Chuan posture (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html">live example</a>) could start by defining the whole body position:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// overall body position</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>7.7</span><span>;</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// torso and head</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the orientation of the legs can be set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// right leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>85</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>straddle</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>35</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// left leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the arms are fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// left arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>155</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>

<span>// right arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dynamic-posture">Dynamic posture</h3>

<p>The dynamic posture – i.e. a posture that changes over time – is set with the same methods that are used for static posture. Mannequin.js defines an empty function <code>animate(t)</code>, which is called in the animation loop once for each frame. All changes of a posture should be defined inside this function (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html">live example</a>). The parameter <em>t</em> is the time, measured in tenths of seconds. This function is set up in <code>createScene()</code>. If <em>createScene</em> and <em>animate</em> are not used, then the animation loop should be managed manually.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p><span><p>Predicting protein folding is a massive problem with huge potential to help us understand disease. It’s been stuck in a rut for the past 50 years, but one team of researchers has come out of nowhere and claims to have solved the problem. But have they?</p></span>
</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">Clinical Need</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>Proteins are made up of amino acids. Getting the amino acid sequence for a protein is pretty easy these days. But going from this sequence to the 3-dimensional shape of the protein is really hard.</p><p>For decades, researchers have worked out protein structures using slow and expensive techniques such as <sample>x-ray crystallography</sample>. So far we’ve only solved about 170,000 proteins using these approaches. Yet more than 200 million proteins have been discovered across all forms of life 😳</p><p>Being able to predict a protein’s shape based on its amino acid sequence would be a game changer. We could design drugs faster by targeting proteins more effectively. But computer-based predictions haven’t been accurate enough to be useful. Until now…</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>X-ray crystallography uses the diffraction of x-rays to work out the shape of a protein. The pictures are murky and there's a lot of guesswork involved!</p>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">What did they do?</h3>
<div><p>The team created a deep learning pipeline for predicting protein shape from its amino acid sequence.</p><p>They entered this neural network into the “Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction” (CASP) competition. Teams are given amino acids sequences for ~100 proteins with unknown structures and asked to predict protein shape. The predictions are given a score from 0-100. Slow techniques (like x-ray crystallography) score above 90.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model work?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>The first version of their model (AlphaFold) performs the following stages:</p><p>First, it looks for similar sequence fragments to the protein of interest from a large protein sequence database. This helps identify features of the protein at interest. An <sample>autoencoder</sample> predicts which protein shape the sequence fragment most likely represents.</p><p>These features are then fed into a convolutional neural network which predicts the distances between different parts of the protein sequence. Predicting distances enables it to also predict contact points.</p><p>Then, using the predicted distances and contact points, the model considers all the possible shapes of the protein and identifies the most likely one.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a type of neural network that compresses data into a bottleneck of it's most important features, and measures it's performance by reconstructing that bottleneck back up to size. It's an in depth topic worth <a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/autoencoders/#:~:text=Autoencoders%20are%20an%20unsupervised%20learning,representation%20of%20the%20original%20input.">reading more on</a></p>

<p><span>
<p>With the updated model (AlphaFold-2) they made some changes. They haven't released a paper yet (only an abstract), but from what we can tell they used an <sample>attention-based deep learning</sample> to fit over the whole shape of the protein, not just the fragments.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Instead of working over the whole sequence at once, this method allows the learning to 'attend' to subsections individually. This is a bit like trying to translate a long german word- instead of trying to decode the whole word, you break it into sub-words and see how they match, then put it all together.</p>

<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model perform?</h3>
<div><p><img alt="Animated Protein" height="450" src="https://explainthispaper.s3.amazonaws.com/images/protein.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>From the start of the competition in 1994 up to 2016, CASP scores had been around 40. The first time DeepMind entered, they scored up to 60. This year- AlphaFold scored an average of 92.4, smashing the threshold of 90/100!</p><p>In fact, the organisers of the competition thought that DeepMind had been cheating, so they set them a special challenge- a membrane protein from an ancient species of <i>archaea</i>. For 10 years with no success, research teams tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein.</p><p>AlphaFold had no problem, returning an image of a three part protein with two helical arms. In hindsight, this structure fit the x-ray crystallography data perfectly, effectively going beyond the limitations of current human research.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">So what?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>This is a thorny problem that researchers and pharmaceutical companies have been working on for 50+ years. This model could predict the shape of proteins without unreliable experimental measurements. This would mean faster development of a wide range of drugs, from cancer drugs that better target proteins for cell replication, to antibiotics that target surface receptors of microbes.</p><p>What’s more, this model was cheap to train- just weeks on quite a <sample>small cluster of servers</sample></p><p>It's worth saying that this isn't the whole picture of protein folding- this still doesn't inform how proteins change shape in the presence of other molecules (like oxygen near haemoglobin). These are also the crystallised protein forms rather than the true 'in vivo' structures, so there may be some errors in translation, but that remains to be seen.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Using Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing#pricing_calculator">pricing calculator</a> and the details from the blog post, this could be trained for around $21,000. In the grand scheme of biology and pharmaceuticals, this is pennies!<br></p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

<p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood&nbsp;concept.</p>



<p>As a&nbsp;paradigm&nbsp;example of&nbsp;deep work,&nbsp;we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential.&nbsp;Graspingcomplex information is hard.</p>



<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>



<p>After some string of words hits your retina and has made its way to your brain, you’re&nbsp;not done.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;cruel&nbsp;irony,&nbsp;these hours of&nbsp;deep work&nbsp;often cause&nbsp;flow&nbsp;states&nbsp;and the feeling that ‘you’ve had a good day’ and learned a&nbsp;shitload&nbsp;of new stuff.</p>



<p>But for many reading&nbsp;episodes&nbsp;this feeling is&nbsp;deceptive.&nbsp;There is anineliminable&nbsp;aspect to learning that takes place&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;glorious&nbsp;flow state.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;other half of the battle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;understanding and&nbsp;integrate&nbsp;it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>



<p>If you don’t&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;this, your learning&nbsp;gains&nbsp;are only a&nbsp;fraction&nbsp;of what they could have been.</p>



<p>In this article,&nbsp;I’m going to breakdown how to win the battle and the war — how to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;these traps and organize your reading habit for a maximalReturn On Investment (ROI)&nbsp;on reading hours.</p>



<p>This is what we’ll cover:</p>

<p>Warning: this is a very&nbsp;nerdy&nbsp;post.</p>



<h3 id="1b1d">Meta-Learning</h3>



<p>Meta-learning&nbsp;is knowing how to learn.&nbsp;It is one of the most important skills to learn, yet few people know how to do to it.</p>



<p>Reading and writing is what I do for a living, and, interestingly, a lot of non-imaginary&nbsp;friends have been asking me how I learn.&nbsp;This is special, becausemost of the times when people don’t know how to do something, they go&nbsp;togreat&nbsp;lengths&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>to notice their&nbsp;deficiency.</p>



<p>Could it be that many students turned ‘knowledge workers’ have the&nbsp;naggingfeeling that something is missing in their skillset because they were never taught&nbsp;meta-learning?</p>



<p>This is not their fault, but a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/schools-dont-support-personal-development-they-distort-it-7e1c227eb01d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack in our education system</a>.</p>



<p>As Adam Robinson observed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/adam-robinson-pt2/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Farnam Street&nbsp;</em>podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“<strong>No one ever shows us how to learn, ever</strong>.&nbsp;Nowhere in school.&nbsp;For example, imagine, Shane, [Shane is the host of the FS podcast] in French class, French 101, your first French class, your teacher said,&nbsp;“Everyone, you’re going to have to learn a lot of vocabulary in this class so before I teach you any words I’m going to teach you a way to remember vocabulary.”&nbsp;They never do that.&nbsp;They just go, “We’re going to have a quiz on these 30 words on Monday.&nbsp;Good luck.”&nbsp;But they don’t teach us how to learn actually, or remember things.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is&nbsp;weird, because,&nbsp;in today’s high-information world,&nbsp;people need the ability to&nbsp;<em>make sense of</em>&nbsp;complexity and to&nbsp;<em>combine</em>&nbsp;many bits of data into a broad picture of the world.</p>



<p>Merely&nbsp;<em>acquiring</em>information is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>(yet) learning.</p>



<p>Learning itself is a skill, and knowing how to do it well is an incredibly valuable advantage.</p>



<p>We take this is for granted, but how to do this is&nbsp;far from&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;and doesn’t get taught in the curriculum.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="1d70">Learning is a&nbsp;two-step&nbsp;process</h3>



<p>So, how do we learn?</p>



<p>Before we attempt to answer the question,&nbsp;let’s get clear&nbsp;on what a&nbsp;satisfactoryanswer needs to get us.&nbsp;What does it&nbsp;<em>mean&nbsp;</em>to learn?&nbsp;When have you learned something?</p>



<p>In the introduction, I stated that&nbsp;just studying the information isn’t enough(no matter how intense your focus was).&nbsp;Learning has&nbsp;two phases — not one.</p>



<ol><li>Read/listen&nbsp;the damn thing</li><li>Process and&nbsp;recall&nbsp;what you’ve just ‘learned’</li></ol>



<p>A lot has been said about the first phase — about deep work, concentration, blocking out&nbsp;distractions, and so&nbsp;forth.&nbsp;This makes sense:&nbsp;if you’re checking Facebook all the time,&nbsp;your mind is not ‘there’, and you might as well not have spent your afternoon ’reading’ this book.</p>



<p>This is all great and I‘m a big fan, but in the&nbsp;meantime, we’re ignoring step two.</p>



<p>If you don’t spend time revisiting and grappling with the book either,&nbsp;<em>the same applies</em> — you might as well not have read it.&nbsp;In the long run, there is no difference between skipping the first or the second stage (except whether you passed that French test in high school back in 2019…).</p>



<p>After you’ve killed Cersei, you’ve still got the&nbsp;White Walkers to deal with.&nbsp;If you don’t, you lose either way.</p>



<p>That is why students who&nbsp;binge-study&nbsp;the night before the exam quite literally forget everything two days later:&nbsp;while all these&nbsp;lame&nbsp;French words were still in their short-term memory,&nbsp;allowing them to pass the test,&nbsp;the information never&nbsp;transitioned&nbsp;to their long-term understanding — and so, sooner or later, it&nbsp;evaporated.</p>



<p>To learn,&nbsp;you need to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from&nbsp;your working memory to your long-term understanding.</p>



<p><strong>The jump from short-term memory to long-term understanding doesn’t happen automatically.</strong><strong>The default mode, after you close your books for the day, is not&nbsp;</strong><strong>retainment</strong><strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<em>forgetting</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>This learning guide&nbsp;is not about&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/why-you-dont-need-to-read-those-productivity-guides-347fe02cc196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to do generic deep work</a>.&nbsp;It explains how to maximize the ROI on hours spent reading,&nbsp;<em>assuming</em>&nbsp;you did them ‘deep work style’.</p>



<h3 id="9181">Remembering the right&nbsp;things</h3>



<p>First, I need to discuss a common&nbsp;objection&nbsp;that denies phase two of learning matters.&nbsp;If you have no&nbsp;quibble&nbsp;with memorization, and doing the required effort, you can skip this section.</p>



<p>“But Mr. Maarten,” the protest goes, “you mention ‘processing’ and ‘remembering’ into my ‘long-term understanding’, but isn’t memorizing pointless?&nbsp;My Google Assistant can look everything up and also is smarter than me, says my Google Assistant.”</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Albert Einstein is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/studying-history-is-more-important-than-ever-in-todays-economy-c99fde4be7d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed</a>&nbsp;to have said:&nbsp;“Never&nbsp;memorize&nbsp;what you can look up in a book”.&nbsp;In Einstein’s days, books were&nbsp;unequaled&nbsp;as a source of information.&nbsp;We, on the other hand, live in an age where nearly everything can be accessed through the magic vehicle of internet.&nbsp;Following Einstein’s logic, then,&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>is worth memorizing anymore, because&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;can be looked up.</p>



<p>But, of course, that is probably not what old Albert was getting at.</p>



<p>Most likely,&nbsp;the advice he wanted to&nbsp;dispense&nbsp;was that&nbsp;you should not waste your time by committing unimportant details to memory.&nbsp;Rather,&nbsp;your&nbsp;focus should be on understanding the bigger picture — on&nbsp;how things relate to each other.</p>



<p>This reminds me of Elon Musk’s&nbsp;approach to learning.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recommends</a>viewing knowledge as a tree:</p>



<blockquote><p>Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.</p></blockquote>



<p>To ‘learn’, we need to do more than merely feeding ourselves new information.&nbsp;Expanding our intelligence requires&nbsp;<em>connecting</em>&nbsp;new materials to what we already knew&nbsp;(the second phase of learning).&nbsp;That, in turn, requires something to connect&nbsp;<em>to.</em></p>



<p>There’s no adding branches without a solid trunk.</p>



<p>The very possibility of genuine insight requires a memorized base.&nbsp;Without it, data you consume will not be added to your tree of knowledge.&nbsp;Instead, they will float in the air for a couple of weeks or so, before being taken away by the wind.</p>



<p>Knowledge, gone.&nbsp;Time, wasted.</p>



<p>What I’m saying is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>that we should&nbsp;devise&nbsp;techniques which enable us torecite&nbsp;everything we’ve learned.&nbsp;That’s why we’re not talking about, for example,&nbsp;retaining&nbsp;the date of the French revolution.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;you&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>learn by heart the lessons it tells you about how the world works&nbsp;and update your representation of reality&nbsp;accordingly.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;other words,&nbsp;you should use it to&nbsp;inform&nbsp;your&nbsp;unconscious — the&nbsp;sum&nbsp;of your mental models.</p>



<h3 id="7b89">Enter: Mental&nbsp;models</h3>



<p>I’ve long been skeptical about mental models since (1) they’re all the rage now and (2) no one seems to be able to explain in concrete terms what they are. A dangerous combination.</p>



<p>It turned out my doubt was due to ignorance on my part.</p>



<p>A mental model,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;tells us, is</p>



<blockquote><p>An explanation of someone’s thought process about how something works in the real world.&nbsp;<strong>It is a representation of the surrounding world</strong>, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences.</p></blockquote>



<p>Every problem and situation is just another ‘one of those’ — another one of a certain type.&nbsp;Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a better job.</p>



<p>On the conscious level, mental models allow us to ‘fit’ different possible interpretations onto reality to see if it is ‘one of those’.</p>



<p>For example,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hanlon’s Razor</a>&nbsp;one should&nbsp;“never attribute tomalice&nbsp;that which is adequately explained by carelessness”.&nbsp;When your coworker hands you crappy slides for the presentation you have to give in five minutes — what’s going on here?</p>



<p>Which ‘one of those’ do we have here?</p>



<p>You can see&nbsp;how different mental models in our heads will cause us to reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the situation.</p>



<p>A mental model is a mental, simplified&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of how something works.They are how we order complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.&nbsp;They help us filter, organize and understand.</p>



<p>For instance, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Pareto distribution</a>,&nbsp;“for many events,&nbsp;roughly 80% of the …</p></div></article></div>

December 4, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/4 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/4">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today we are going to explore five big hacks that took place in 2020. First we'll cover two hacks that targeted Norwegian companies Sykehuspartner and NHH. Then we'll take a look at a hack that targeted the Danish company ISS. To wrap things up we'll cover what is probably the two most high profile hacks of 2020: the Twitter phish and the CWT ransom.</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Sykehuspartner</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hyMVdWh/Skjermbilde-2020-11-20-kl-07-30-21.png" alt="Sykehuspartner logo" title="Sykehuspartner"></p>
<p>Sykehuspartner deliver IT, HR, project and logistics services to all hospitals in the Norwegian health region Helse Sør-Øst (Health South East). It manages vital IT systems for the hospitals, both clinical and administrative applications, as well as infrastructure and networks.</p>
<p>On august 22 2020 several of Sykehuspartners applications became the target of an unknown malicious actor. Only one hospital (Sykehuset Innlandet) was targeted in this attack. Not much is known by the type and scope of the attack, except for what type of data might possibly have been stolen. The potentially stolen data might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the deceased</li>
<li>Health information about patients from research projects</li>
<li>Personal information about employees</li>
<li>Name and social security number (fødselsnummer) of students</li>
</ul>
<p>From reports about the incident, we know that 25 patients and several employees have been notified of personal information having been stolen. Following the attack, the hospital has carried out a forced password change for all employees.</p>

</ul>
<h2>NHH</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/sjQnhNF/imageedit-10-3684463812.png" alt="NHH logo" title="NHH logo"></p>
<p>In august this year, Norges handelshøgskole (NHH, English: Norwegian School of Economics), experienced a data heist. The school is one of the leading business schools in Europe and is located in the city of Bergen. </p>
<p>Usernames and passwords of both students and employees was compromised. The break in was discovered when the stolen credentials were uploaded to a “hacker” forum. The attack targeted a known vulnerability in an old version of the VPN service called Pulse Secure. An updated version that patches this vulnerability has been available since April 2019. But NHH is decommissioning the service and has thus been neglecting to update it. All students and employees were asked to change their passwords after the incident.</p>

</ul>
<h2>ISS</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDJVmgQ/imageedit-12-3910494650.png" alt="ISS logo" title="ISS logo"></p>
<p>In the middle of February this year, ISS was hit by a ransomware attack. ISS is a global facility services company, founded in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company has 450,000 employees.</p>
<p>The ransomware was a massive malware attack across IT-systems and networks. Immediately after the attack was discovered, IT-access was removed to isolate the indicent. As reported by the company. Regardless of the actions taken, the company had to write down and change big parts of the IT-infrastructure. It is estimated that the attack will cost the company between 750 and 1340 million Norwegian kroner (NOK).</p>
<p>It was reported that customer data was not stolen.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter, you know, the social media platform? Yes, that one. In July this year, it was hit with a phishing campaign that was used to target high-profile individuals, like Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Twitter stated that "This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems".</p>
<p>The phish was used to get access to certain high-profile accounts. The compromised accounts were used to promote a bitcoin scam.</p>

</ul>
<h2>CWT</h2>
<p>CWT is a travel management company that manages business travel, meetings and so on. The 27 of July this year, the company was hit by a massive ransomware attack that knocked 30,000 computers offline. The hackers claimed to have stolen two terabytes of files, including financial reports, security documents and employees’ personal data. CWT paid $4.5 million to the hackers to restore their systems. </p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about this hack was that the negotiation chat, where the company and the hackers met to talk, was left open to the public after the negotiations ended. This gives us a never before seen insight into how the negotiations between hacker and hacked works. As many others have noted after the chat became public, it is rarely advised to actually pay the hackers like CWT did. This is, of course, because of the precedence it sets and that the chance of getting scamed is very high.</p>

</ul>

<p>This is of course not a complete list of all the major hacks that were reported in 2020. It sure has been a very active year in this regard. As you can see, there are many ways of being vulnerable on the internet. If you want to better understand how to prevent some of these things happening to you, take a look at the previous three posts:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
I got involved in wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASpencerk&amp;action=history&amp;year=2006&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=">very early</a>.

It was one of the most revealing things in my life, watching it being laughed at, to become the center of, and authority of, human knowledge.

It was obvious that it was working. The lag of this was 5 years or more.

Wikipedia was an experiment that proved itself, when every graph was going up and to the right.

Some of the graphs are now going down.

</p><p>Wikipedia's Markup language:</p><p>
One of the central design decisions in wikipedia is that <span>all information</span> is stored in an editable document.
This poses a huge amount of challenges for caching and scaling wikipedia. It's not a database, that you can run a script on.

Worse though, is that all of it's content is buried in this ad-hoc, impenetrable, opaque, and mostly <i>un-parsable</i> format.

If wikipedia had used <i>markdown</i>, <i>html</i>, or some <i>standardised format</i>, any parser would flip-it into other future formats.

Wikipedia's custom language is just <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/blob/master/README.md">clearly insane</a>, undocumented, hopeless.
There's a team <span>(of great people!)</span> at wikimedia <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/parsoid/">constantly working on it</a>, and unable to make any backwards-incompatible changes. I imagine their lives are hard.
People are creating weird new syntax concepts all the time.

Here's the markup for the <b>first sentence</b> of the Albert Einstein wikipedia article:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/albert-einstein.jpg">

The first wikimedia parser was called <a href="https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/">mwparserfromhell</a>. DBPedia, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/LOD_Cloud_2014-08.svg">the center of the semantic web</a>, after years of work, has only ever offered limited parsing from categories and infoboxes.
Much of the early-years at <b>Freebase</b> were spent trying, with limited-success, at parsing wikipedia.
I've spent <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/graphs/commit-activity">years</a> trying to parse it myself.
I'm a shitty programmer. <i>WolframAlpha</i>, and many other serious companies are using my parser,
       which is <span>down right hilarious</span>.

<img id="rtl" src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/rtl.jpg"></p><p>yes, arabic editors must write it in right-to-left, <a href="https://youtu.be/OCQd02hORJQ">somehow</a>.</p><p>

It's hard to describe how much of a serious problem this is.
Wikipedia's content is never going to go anywhere, or be used by anything.

Wikipedia may slowly die-off - like myspace, or geocities - but it's information will not go on.

Play-around in the official wikipedia android app. Many pages are unreadable.
There is a good-deal of <i>clearfix</i>, and <span>table-span</span> logic, mushed right into the syntax.
Most developers will not touch this kind of stuff.

There will be no move to a wikipedia 2.

</p><p>Static copies of dynamic content</p><p>
The contents of the english wikipedia dump are as follows, (as of Jan 2019):
</p><p>
of the <b>14m</b> records in the wikipedia dump, only <b>5.5m</b> (40%) are public-facing articles.

   <span>Yup.</span>
This does not include deleted pages, or old versions, either.


<b>Redirects:</b>
A computer-science 101 problem is to implement a fuzzy string matching. There's usually a section in the textbook about it:
</p><div>
<p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/clr.jpg"></p><p>oh yes, right here in chapter 34.</p><p>
there are <b>8,550,441</b> redirects in wikipedia.
They are mostly typos, or case-changes, and are mostly created by hand, every day.

<span>and what happens to a redirect when a page gets deleted, or merged, or spli - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot">Yup</a>.</span>
</p></div>

<p><b>Talk pages:</b>
Wikipedia has 35m registered users. When a user joins, a bot will often send them a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Welcome">{{welcome}}</a> template.
Sometimes nice users will do it themselves. It looks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kj_aviator">like this</a>.

   - when this happens, this creates a new user page, with <b>a copy of this text</b> each time.

There are millions of examples of this in the dump. The same text, verbatim over and over.

The same process happens with <b>'Wikiprojects'</b>. Bots go around adding templates, by creating a talk page, and adding a template to it.

The same process happens with <i>deleted pages, fair-use warnings, and some bot edits</i>. Each time an edit happens, a new page is created, and boilerplate text gets thrown into it.
Resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:XTC_discography">this</a>:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/boilerplate.png"></p><hr><p>
So let's get things straight:
in <b>1993</b>, a small japanese game company created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">this videogame</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/thunder.jpg">
</p><p>
• In <b>2008</b>, a wikipedia user created the article with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">two sentences and a link</a>.

• In the past 10 years since, the page has been edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">26 times by bots</a>.

• this created a Talk page filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">11 automated sentences</a>.

A huge bulk of the wikipedia database is this boilerplate text. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:764_Gedania">this asteroid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NS3_(HCV)">this virus</a>, or this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceania_Judo_Union">judo club</a>.

... and remember, if we wanted to change this text, we'd have to go and edit each of these pages - and because this syntax is so nuts, <b>bots have a hard time</b> making even simple stylistic changes, without ruining a whole page.

oh, so what happens to these auto-generated talk pages when a page is deleted, merged, or spli- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:578_Happelia">yup</a>

<b id="automation">Automated articles:</b>
There is a lot of disagreement about how much of wikipedia is generated by bots, and if this matters.
There's no way of knowing. Any boring-themed article with a few sentences, a reference, and an infobox probably won't get deleted.
So nothing's stopping you from spitting-out articles from a <b>database of enzymes</b>, or <b>college rugby players</b>, or season statistics for defunct sports teams.
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/enzymes.jpg">
  <img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/subgiants.png">
</p><p>
I have nothing against bots, I have nothing against the long-tail, but I think automated article-creation is responsible for a good amount of the wikipedia's claimed growth, over the past few years.
We need to be up-front about this, if we're talking about the health of the project.

Here's the distribution of words in english wikipedia, by the size of articles:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>ok hey,</span> I don't mind that the wm developers didn't develop a fancy search index, in 2001.
That's fine.
Nobody could have predicted the success and scale of wikipedia early on.
</p><p>
What angers me though
         - <i>and it should anger you</i> -
is that these problems has not been fixed in the <b>18 years</b> since.

God damn them.

Well-meaning people are wasting their time on this <span>everyday</span>.

Any <i>startup job-interview</i> asks questions about implementing a system like this.
Any CS grad can create a lucene index, to handle typos.
Some of it is complicated. Some of it is basic competence.

<span>It's annoying to whine</span>,
     but at some point, we're right to be angry at wikipedia.

            that it cannot find 2nd gear,
     when the rest of the world is zipping-along.
</p>
</div>

<p>Wikidata</p><p>
In 2007 Danny Hillis raised $57 million dollars,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/metawebtechnologies#section-overview">[1]</a> bought-out the <b>entire</b> MIT semantic-web group,
hired 50~ employees, (including <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">this person</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toby-Segaran/e/B001I9RQVS">this person</a>, <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/">this person</a>) and got an office in the mission.

They reconciled all of wikipedia, the entire musicbrainz database, the entire open-library database, the tvdb database, and all of wordnet.
They signed a (massive) deal to import <b>all collections of the stanford library</b>.<a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub152/stanford-linked-data-workshop/">[2]</a>

They hit <b>high-90%</b> classification of all <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44818.pdf"><b>50 million</b></a> entities (wikipedia has 5m)
They were evaluated at very-high 90's accuracy by several third-parties.

Facebook, Bing, Amazon, and Google all began using its data in nearly real-time in their search products.

This was one of the largest and most ambitious software projects in history.

In 2010 freebase was bought for a whack of money, and then killed-off by google.
When google announced they would be shutting down the API, they offered to import all of this data to a new wikimedia project called <span>wikidata</span>.

Wikidata was 4-or-5 Lua developers, in Germany, on a few research grants.

</p><p>and they said no. 😐</p><p>

so they said this data didn't meet it's guidelines regarding sourced data.

    <i>... aren't you pulling information <b>from wikipedia</b> blindly?</i>

    <i>... what about your (~60%) unreferenced facts?</i>

    <i>... aren't you <b>multiplying vandalism</b> from multi-lingual wikipedias?</i>

    <i>... how do you use, or verify references?</i>

They built a tool to <b>hand-transfer each freebase fact</b>, which if you have a calculator, may seem funny.
<span>(at 10 people clicking full-time, would have taken 10 million years)</span>

8 years later, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> remains tiny, buggy, unused, and worse - <i>majority unreferenced</i>.
I mean, they're pulling their data from wikipedia, which gets vandalized almost every minute!

It's accomplished very-little from its 5-year plan. They write academic papers.
They still don't really offer a rest api.
       ...creating new types or properties is I think, possible? or it's supposed to be...

It's got few of the safeguards, momentum, features, and ambition that Freebase had a full decade ago.
If wikidata was a company, it would not exist anymore, and you wouldn't have heard of it.

But Wikimedia places <b>banner-ads</b> on <span>hours of eye-blistering user-created content</span>,
begging children, students, and poor-people for money.
and they choose to be this petty, pithy and behind-the-times.

</p><p>Category-system</p><p>
It's a beautiful idea, to classify information with category-scheme, <a href="https://humane.computer/review-the-science-of-managing-our-digital-stuff/">until it falls-apart</a>.

<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/shirky-category.jpg"></a>
Wikipedia has many-thousands of categories. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dump_reports/Category_cycles">loop-around</a> all-over the place.

</p><p>
People:
    → Musicians
        → Singers
              → American_Idol
                  → Books_about_American_Idol
</p><p>
or worse:
</p><p><span>Albanian language</span>:
    → Albanian-speaking countries and territories
      → Kosovo (region)
        → Kosovo
          → Kosovar society
            → Languages of Kosovo
              → <span>Albanian language</span>
</p><p>
if you're ever too-cheerful, and wanting to feel depressed, have a visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/Today">Categories for deletion/Today</a>,
where you'll see precious human-life spent debating whether <b>'Category:Goth'</b> should exist, if it is a genre of music, if it's is a fashion-style, etc.

Work is being ravenously deleted all the time. You'll get sad thinking about it.

You're right.

Wikipedia has good structured-data in <b>infoboxes, lists, tables, citations, etc</b>.

The issue is, as of Feb 2019, Wikipedia has <b>634,755 different kinds of templates</b> (see this <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/spencer-scratch/allTemplates-2018-10-26.tsv">21mb download</a>).

Yes, there are all different.

Yes, there are <span>templates-within-templates-with-escaping-with-escaping</span>.

Even if you parse them perfectly, how do you know that for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:HorseDeathYear">Template:HorseDeathYear</a>, the third parameter is the <b>birth date of the horse</b>, and the fourth is the birth-month?

see, for example:

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:16-Team_bracket_templates">Tennis Brackets vs Table Tennis Brackets</a>

• '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth_date_and_age">Birth_date_and_age</a>' vs '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth-date_and_age">Birth-date_and_age</a>'.

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Trapezoidnotation">a template for a Trapezoid unicode symbol</a>
It's just a straight-up mess.

If you're thinking, <i>gee wikipedia editors must feel exhausted and stupid</i> - you're right.

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/olflh5jfvk5clb15p5z9.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><em>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1334901024201445376?s=20">I've been helped</a>, thank you for reaching out. In case you were wondering what it looks like from Twitter's side, this is what they emailed:</em></p>

December 4, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/4 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/4">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>I’ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It’s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That’s also why it’s currently still used on over <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Font-API">42M websites</a>!</p>
<p>This convenience has its price: Performance. Many <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/">have</a> <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">already</a> <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance#disadvantages-of-web-fonts">pointed</a> <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/self-hosted-fonts-vs-google-fonts-api/">out</a> the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you’re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

<p>The Eysturoyartunnilin (or Eysturoy Tunnel, earlier known as Skálafjarðartunnilin) is a large infrastructure project which connects the island of Streymoy to the island of Eysturoy through a sub-sea road tunnel under the Tangafjørður sound in the Faroe Islands. It also crosses the southern part of Skálafjørður and connects the towns of Runavík on the eastern side and Strendur on the western side of the fjord. Altogether, the three-branch sub-sea tunnel measures 11.24 kilometres (6.8 miles) long, including an underwater roundabout. Construction costs are estimated to be around a billion DKK. It will open for traffic in December 2020.</p>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable
to configure the notes directory and 1 symlink to install it to your
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, perfection is that I don't want to have any errors in what I do. It's hard and exhausted to keep everything perfect. When I publish a piece of content, I want it to be perfect. But I always feel something was wrong and afraid someone would point out the error. After all, I just make a little modification and leave it behind because it's wasting time.</p>
<p>I have so much content I want to create. I don't want to stick with a piece of content for too long. When I start creating another piece of content, I try to avoid previous mistakes. I also try something new in it. The joy of creating content is you can try something new and see if it works.</p>
<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <h4>Feed-forward NeRF from One View</h4>
                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <h4>Scene-level Representation</h4>
                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>zsh</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/77afe2674803d965a0f5abd108337040">.zshrc</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

<h2 id="my-workflow-in-action-boom">My Workflow in Action <img title=":boom:" alt=":boom:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>
