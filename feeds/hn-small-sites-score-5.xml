<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr><p><em>This is an automatic translation, we apologize for any mistakes. You can read the original spanish <a href="https://auamstrad.es/hardware/mundo-cpc/amstrad-cpc-472/">version here</a>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>The Amstrad CPC 472 is an 8-bit Microcomputer of the Amstrad brand, </strong>belonging to the classic range of <strong>CPC </strong>(<strong>Colour Personal Computer</strong>) and sold exclusively in Spain between 1985 and 1986. It is a personal computer almost identical to its predecessor, the CPC 464.</p><p>At the sight, it is only distinguished by the screen printing of the case, where the «64» is replaced by a «72», however, it has a particularity that <strong>makes it special: those extra 8 KB of RAM</strong> that indicates its name and that are accompanied by a hilarious and sometimes even crazy story. A succession of anecdotes, occurrences and arguing that will delight the most curious by the history of microinformatics.</p><p>For example, not everyone knows that <strong>t</strong>he CPC 472<strong> owes its existence to another 8-bit microcomputer: the Dragon</strong>. Had it not been for the emergence of Dragon computers in the Spanish computer scene, the Range of the Amstrad CPC would have gone from version 464 to 664 and completed in the 6128 (not counting the plus range). However, the Dragon brand was decisive for Amstrad to take out in Spain, and only in Spain, its version 472.</p><p><strong>How and why did it all happen?</strong> It’s a fascinating story, full of ambitious characters, business odagos, influence-trade and even palatial intrigue. But let’s start at the beginning….</p><h3>Dragon, the microcomputer made in Spain</h3><p>In 1982<strong>, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Data" target="_blank" aria-label="Dragon Data (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dragon Data</a> was a subsidiary of a British toy company called Mettoy,</strong> which then had financial problems. They get more funding from a number of sources, one of them bein<strong>g the Welsh Development Office</strong>. As a result, this UK-constituting nation moves the Dragon factory and began producing mass microcomputers.</p><p>However, after various commercial vicissitudes, in 1984 the majority distributor decided to abandon its distribution and try to settle the brand. Several bids from companies such as Tandy or Philips come into play, but eventually it was <strong>Spain’s</strong> Eurohard who bought Dragon’s<strong> right</strong>s for 150 million pesetas (almost one million euros), which accounted for less than a third of its real value. In principle, it seemed like a good deal.</p><figure><img width="640" height="499" src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg" alt="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-src-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w" srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w"><figcaption>Dragon 32</figcaption></figure><p>Eurohard’s di<strong>rective</strong> moved in the high circles of Spanish politics.

An appetizing and hearty candy for any company.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dragon computer ad in 1985</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, <strong>Eurohard’s leaders failed </strong>to convince the Minister of Education and Science, socialist <strong>José María Maravall</strong>, and the<strong> </strong>Athena project was eventually nurtured with mostly foreign teams (Olivetti, IBM, Fujitsu…), with MS-DOS-compatible PCs being preferred as an operating system. To be sure, foreign brands also had their contacts in important circles of power.</p><p>Despite the clarity of the technical specifications (including the 5 1/4 floppy disk), we can find on the Internet <a href="http://www.elmundodelspectrum.com/proyecto-atenea-conoceis-a-atenea/" target="_blank" aria-label="testimonials from people (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testimonials from people</a> who had at their <strong>Amstrad CPC 6128 schools and even Spectrum without a disk drive</strong>, so it follows that the application of Project Athena was also not very strict. In any case, <strong>Eurohard’s management failed</strong> to take over this succulent business for its <strong>Dragons</strong> and, at most, a few microcomputers of the brand would manage to enter the Spanish classrooms, which was a major economic blow to the company’s ambitions.</p><h3>The Spanish tariff policy</h3><p>However, not all aces had fallen out of their sleeves. What <strong>Eurohard</strong> did<strong> </strong>get from the Spanish government, in this case the Minister of Economy and Finance<strong>, Carlos So<em>lchaga</em></strong><em>, was <a href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1985/07/25/pdfs/A23677-23677.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Royal Decree 1215/1985, of 17 July, amending certain subheadings of the customs tariff (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Royal Decree 1215/1985, of 17 July, amending certain subheadings of the customs tariff</a>,</em> which imposed the importation of a wide range of electronic machines and, in this way, it was intended to curb the interferences of foreign computer manufacturers on the Spanish market.

<![CDATA[Show HN: Building Pastebin for text using Nginx and Lua]]>

<br/>
September 15, 2020 | https://usamaejaz.com/nginx-lua-pastebin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://usamaejaz.com/nginx-lua-pastebin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>At times I use different services for sharing text or code snippets. Pastebin is a well known term for such services (where you <em>paste</em> whatever you want to share). The functionality is also simple (mostly) and that’s why I decided to build a pastebin service using only NGINX.</p>

<p><img src="https://usamaejaz.com/images/nginx-lua.png" alt="NGINX and Lua"></p>

<p>I have been a fan of NGINX the moment I learnt of it. In my earlier days (about 5 yrs ago), I was an <em>Apache guy</em>. But the moment I became familiar with NGINX and its vast power, I never looked at any other webserver software.</p>

<p>I often share text or code snippets online and that is why, It was fun to build it without using any “backend”. NGINX alone was enough with its <a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module">awesome Lua module</a> which offers unlimited possibilities. I wanted to make it simple so there is not much in it other than the only feature of storing plain-text pastes.</p>

<h2 id="nginx-config">NGINX Config</h2>

<p>The whole backend of this pastebin is inside of the NGINX config. The Lua code within <code>content_by_lua_block</code> is all responsible for saving the paste. The code is saving the pastes to the local filesystem but there are endless possibilities (for example, storing in a database like mysql or redis).</p>

<p>The following location block is responsible for all <code>/api/pastes</code> requests. The directory to which the paste is saved must also be writeable by the webserver user.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># api for storing paste
location = /api/pastes {
	default_type "text/plain";

		client_max_body_size 128k;
		client_body_buffer_size 128k;
			
	content_by_lua_block {
		ngx.req.read_body()
		
		local method = ngx.req.get_method()

		if method == "POST" then
			local args, err = ngx.req.get_post_args(1)

			if err == "truncated" then
				ngx.say("error: only one POST parameter allowed.")
				ngx.exit(403)
			end

			if not args then
				ngx.say("error: failed to get post args: ", err)
				ngx.exit(500)
			end
			
			local content = args.content

			if content == nill then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' not set")
				ngx.exit(400)
			elseif content == "" then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' is empty")
				ngx.exit(400)
			end

			math.randomseed(os.clock()+os.time())
			local random = math.random
			local function randid()
				local template ='xxxx4xxxxxxyxxxx'
				return string.gsub(template, '[xy]', function (c)
					local v = (c == 'x') and random(0, 0xf) or random(8, 0xb)
					return string.format('%x', v)
				end)
			end
			local name = randid()
			local file, err = io.open("/var/www/nginx-pastebin/pastes/" .. name, "w")
			if file == nill then
				ngx.say("error: couldn't open file: ", err)
			else 
				file:write(content)
				file:close()
			end
			
			ngx.say("https://", ngx.var.host, "/", name)

		elseif method == "GET" then
			ngx.say("send a post request with 'content=your_text_content'")
		else 
			ngx.say("error: not allowed")
			ngx.exit(405)
		end
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an example of how services involving simple (or even complicated?) logic can be written using Lua inside NGINX.</p>

<p><code>ngx</code> has many other APIs and you can perform almost every NGINX-related action in your Lua code (rewriting, redirects, caching, serving content and much more).</p>

<h2 id="demo-and-complete-code">Demo and Complete Code</h2>

<p>I have set this up on <a href="https://pastebin.usamaejaz.com/">pastebin.usamaejaz.com</a>  and the source code has been pushed to <a href="https://github.com/usamaejaz/nginx-pastebin">github.com/usamaejaz/nginx-pastebin</a>.</p>

<p><span>The real endgame is to harness the <strong>power of the Crowd</strong> to have each other’s back.</span></p>
<p>While your agent is blocking aggressive IP, it can also share them with the global network. The community then gets fed with your spottings and you also benefit from the community ones in return. The goal is to create the most accurate and complete IP reputation database. Together we create a real-time IP reputation system that benefits all of our community members. So far, it gathers and maintains a fresh (less than 72 hours) list of 100 000 malevolent IPs addresses.</p>
<p><span>The consensus database (which stores aggressive IPs) includes a native anti-false-positive and anti-poisoning system. API oriented from day 1, our goal is to make it usable anywhere (infra, code, app, framework, libs, etc.). L</span><span>ast but not least, it has also been designed to be GD</span><span>PR compliant and privacy respectful.</span></p>
<h2>Born in the Cloud, thought for the Cloud</h2>
<p><span>To adapt to modern architectures, CrowdSec uses a decoupled approach “<strong>detect here, remedy there</strong>”. For example, if it detects an attack directed toward your database, it could remediate it on your firewall. To date, Netfilter (with an Ipset), Cloudflare, Nginx &amp; WordPress are supported. We work on new ones like Captcha, MFA, throttling,&nbsp; limiting access to some folders or features, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>If you decide to write Datasource connectors, log parsers, scenarios, you can share them on the </span><span><a href="http://hub.crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>community hub</span></a></span><span>. The scenario grammar (YAML) is very versatile and allows for a lot of creativity. ie: If someone is hammering a webpage that takes a lot of CPU to generate, you can throttle. If an IP is port scanning, web scanning, and brute-forcing, you could consider it’s a targeted attack and not an opportunistic one and apply different remediation.</span></p>
<h2>Fully Open-Source&amp; Free</h2>
<p><span>CrowdSec, the behavior &amp; reputation-based security engine, is based on an <strong>MIT license</strong> and is open to contributions.<br>
Don’t hesitate to reach out to us through our </span><span><a href="https://crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Website</span></a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GitHub</span></a></span><span>, or interact directly with the team on our </span><span><a href="https://gitter.im/crowdsec-project/community#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gitter</span></a></span>, we’ll be glad to help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1058"><div><p>I spend a lot of time working remotely, and while I have a decently sized laptop, I often miss having a second monitor. I looked at USB monitors, but then I remembered my old 2014 Galaxy Tab. Could I use it as a second monitor? The answer is: yes!</p><p>This setup works via virtual output devices and VNC. It essentially creates a remote desktop session on your laptop, which you can view and even interact with from your tablet. It’ll technically work with any network-ready computing device for that matter, whether it’s a tablet, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, or even another laptop.</p><p>These instructions are for Linux. Any Linux distribution should work, but you <em>must</em> be using X.org, not Wayland. You’ll also need to install the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">Android Debug Bridge</a> (adb) and <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a>.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175">download the full script from GitHub</a>. This post explains how the script works and provides setup instructions.</p><h2>Step 1: Create a Virtual Output Device</h2><p>First, we need to create a virtual output device by configuring Xorg. Create a file named <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-virtual.conf</code> and add the following contents:<br> <code>Section "Device"<br> </code><code>&nbsp;Identifier "intelgpu0"<br> Driver "intel"<br> Option "VirtualHeads" "1"<br> EndSection</code></p><p>The Identifier and Driver options will be different if your GPU is AMD or Nvidia. You can add more virtual outputs by changing the <code>VirtualHeads</code> option, but for now let’s keep it at one. Save the file, then log out and log back in to apply the changes. To confirm, run the <code>xrandr</code> command. You should see a line starting with <code>VIRTUAL1 disconnected</code>.</p><h2>Step 2: Configuring and Enabling the Virtual Display</h2><p>Now, we need to configure the virtual display by setting its resolution and placement relative to the primary display (i.e. the laptop screen).</p><p>Open the <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175"><code>create-android-display.sh</code></a> file in a text editor and change the following lines to match your specific setup:</p><ul><li><code>W=1920</code> and <code>H=1080</code> set the width and height of the virtual display. Set this to your tablet screen’s resolution.</li><li><code>VIRTUAL1</code> should match the name of the virtual display as reported by xrandr.</li><li><code>eDP1</code> should match the name of your primary display. You can use xrandr to confirm this as well.</li></ul><p>The line starting with <code>PW</code> uses xrandr to get the width of the primary display. We’ll use this later on when creating the VNC session.</p><p>The lines starting with <code>gtf</code> configure the display and set its position relative to the primary display. In the third line, you can change where the display is located by changing <code>--right-of</code> to <code>--left-of</code>, <code>--above</code>, or <code>--below</code>.&nbsp;These instructions assume you’re using <code>--right-of</code>, so if you decide to change the placement, note that you’ll need to change the crop options when running x11vnc.</p><h2>Step 3: Create a VNC Session</h2><p>For VNC, we’ll use <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> because it can expose an existing Xorg session without requiring root permissions. We’ll use the <code>-clip</code> option to restrict the visible area to the virtual monitor.&nbsp;We’ll also use <code>-localhost</code> to prevent x11vnc from exposing the session over the network for better security.</p><p><code>x11vnc -localhost -clip ${W}x${H}+${PW}+0</code></p><p>Some 3D applications and compositing window managers don’t work well over VNC, so if your screen isn’t updating, try adding <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-beryl"><code>-noxdamage</code></a>&nbsp;to the command.</p><h2>Step 4: Create an ADB Session</h2><p>VNC software uses port 5900 by default. However, since we ran x11vnc with <code>-localhost</code>, only software running on the laptop itself can access the VNC session. Fortunately, we can use adb to forward port 5900 on our laptop to port 5900 on our tablet. With port forwarding enabled, our tablet can access x11vnc as if it was coming from localhost.</p><p>We’ll forward the port with the command:</p><p><code>adb reverse tcp:5900 tcp:5900</code></p><h2>Step 5: Connect From Your Tablet</h2><p>The final step is to use a VNC viewer app on your tablet to open the x11vnc session. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.freebVNC&amp;hl=en_US">bVNC</a>, but any viewer app will work.</p><p>From the app, enter <code>localhost</code> as the target and click connect. In a moment, you should see your virtual monitor appear on screen. Move your cursor around, drag windows, and watch them appear on your tablet! Once you disconnect, the script automatically turns off the virtual display on your laptop so you don’t have “invisible windows” floating off-screen.</p><figure id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;ssl=1" alt="Using an Android tablet as a second monitor" width="656" height="875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1062">Kate and Konsole on an Android tablet via VNC.</figcaption></figure><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>VNC isn’t a perfect protocol, and it can be slow even over USB. It’s alright for web browsing and Slack/Discord, but I wouldn’t use it to watch movies. You <em>can</em> use VNC over the network, but this comes with some severe security implications. Make sure you enable encryption and password protection before exposing your desktop to <em>any</em> network.</p><p>One problem I couldn’t completely resolve was black bars appearing on my tablet when the tablet resolution was different from the laptop resolution. The bars completely covered the desktop and any windows I had on the screen. My only solution was to use the same resolution for both the laptop and the tablet, but this was workable for me.</p><p>Have any issues, thoughts, or suggestions?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I've used iPhones since 2008, adding thousands of dollars to Apple's giant pile
of cash. Much like <a href="https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/">my move from macOS to
Linux</a> more than 3 years ago,
Apple's recent behaviour has prompted me to consider iPhone/iOS alternatives.
Join me on this journey into the world of Android and the lack of real choice
that smartphones present in 2020.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For about 12 years I've owned iPhones, most bought outright, totalling thousands
of dollars. I've held on to my most recent iPhone, an iPhone X longer than all
others. Contrary to claims of planned obsolescence it still works well. I like
technology though, and was planning to replace it this year and pass it on to my
father.</p>
<p>Apple have recently ramped up their hostility towards the developers that make
iOS the desirable platform it is. App Store horror stories are nothing new, but
lately Apple seems to have really ramped up their desire to extract money from
every developer's business, despite being one of the richest companies in the
world. They seemingly do so without regard for whether the end-user experience is
actually better for it.</p>
<p>Recent events, perhaps starting with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">Hey saga</a> and continuing with
the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know">ongoing battle with Epic</a> have not reflected well. Apple
appears to see developers as owing them for the privilege of being in their store and
using their APIs. This is despite app development requiring a yearly membership
fee of AU$149, and purchase of Mac hardware for development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand that Basecamp has developed a number of apps and many
subsequent versions for the App Store for many years, and that the App Store
has distributed millions of these apps to iOS users. These apps do not offer
in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the
App Store over the last eight years. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation">Apple App Review Board</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epic decided that it would like to reap the benefits of the App Store without
paying anything for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Apple legal submission, via <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1303462987924221952?s=20">Marco Arment</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple: Epic only looking for a free ride</p>
<p>Epic, according to Apple, has given Apple $257,000,000 in commission fees in
two years over in-app purchases that Apple has no hand, act, part in, doesn't
host on their servers, just for the privilege of existing on their OS. ‘Free
ride’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1303465156551282689?s=20">Steve Troughton-Smith</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To take just one example, Epic has for years used Apple's groudbreaking
graphics technology, Metal. [..] Apple doesn't charge anything beyond its
standard commission for the use of Metal or any of the other tools that Epic
has used to develop great games on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Philip Schiller, via <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1297027872549474306?s=20">Steve Troughton-Smith</a></p>
<p>The only alternative to Metal is OpenGL and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12894/apple-deprecates-opengl-across-all-oses">Apple have deprecated
that</a>!</p>
<p>Anyway, whether you agree with Apple or not this whole thing has me (a developer
by trade, and a <a href="https://binarytrance.com/apps/symbolmate.html">past contributor to the App Store</a>) feeling offside.
Additionally, since I now use Linux full-time there are other sources of friction:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhones work best when paired with a Mac (or even a PC running Windows).</li>
<li>Apple only support building apps on Macs, so if I want to cobble together an
app for my phone it's no longer possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My only real recourse as a consumer is voting with my wallet and perhaps
sharing my reasoning on this blog, so here we are. If enough people do this
maybe they will take notice, maybe they won't, but I feel I at least need to
try. Just like last time, when <a href="https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/">I sought a replacement for Mac OS X and
switched to Linux</a> I have been
evaluating alternatives to iOS.</p>
<p>It's worth noting at this point that I <em>really</em> dislike
Google. I distanced myself from all of their services about 8 years ago. The
only Google service I use regularly is YouTube. I use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> for email,
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for search, Apple + <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for photos, <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>, iMessage,
<a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> for chat.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-alternatives">Evaluating Alternatives</h2>
<p>Initial research turned up the following candidates. Almost all were
immediately written-off due to lacking apps or being too immature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android as shipped on a mainstream phone
<ul>
<li>Full of apps and services dependant on Google.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for microG</a>
<ul>
<li>LineageOS with microG compatibility library to allow running apps that rely
on Google APIs, without using Google services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a>
<ul>
<li>Good in theory: An <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> based OS for your phone. However, it notes,
"Beta version. Calls don't work on most phones yet", on the home page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">Librem 5 + PureOS</a>
<ul>
<li>By all accounts the expensive hardware is still not great quality and the
software is still being built.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.webos-ports.org/wiki/Main_Page">LuneOS (WebOS)</a>
<ul>
<li>Very small ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sailfishos.org/">Sailfish OS</a>
<ul>
<li>Bills itself as, "the mobile OS solution for corporations and governments",
right on the front page. I am neither of these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give up on a smartphone
<ul>
<li>Get a basic phone for calls and texts and do everything else on a real
computer, possibly an ultra compact like the <a href="https://au.banggood.com/Original-Box-GPD-Pocket-2-Intel-Celeron-3965Y-Dual-Core-8GB-RAM-256GB-ROM-7-Inch-Windows-10-OS-Tablet-PC-p-1430504.html?rmmds=mywishlist&amp;cur_warehouse=CN">GPD Pocket 2</a>.</li>
<li>A friend who has never owned a smartphone talked me out of this. It's
possible but very inconvenient. Especially due to some things only being
possible with a smartphone like ride sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out duopolies suck: you can choose some modicum of respect for privacy
with developer hostile Apple, or get a bit more freedom with surveillance
capitalist Google. The candidates that seem most viable for me are LineageOS,
and LineageOS for microG.  To test out this theory I purchased the cheapest
phone supported by LineageOS that I could get new: a <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/onclite/">Redmi 7</a> by Xiaomi for
AU$175.</p>
<p>For the price I was honestly expecting this phone to be hot garbage. It is in
fact much better that I expected. However, this was just a platform for testing
the software ecosystem, I won't be reviewing the hardware or letting it colour
my impressions of Android. If this experiment goes well my plan would be to by
a higher quality iPhone replacement phone.</p>
<h3 id="stock-miui-rom">Stock MIUI ROM</h3>
<p>I spent a small amount of time with the stock ROM<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> (<a href="https://en.miui.com/">MIUI</a>) that the Redmi comes
with to get a bit of a baseline. It worked well enough and was fairly
aesthetically pleasing, but the ads and tracking were truly horrifying. Just
take a look at <a href="https://gadgetstouse.com/blog/2020/05/11/miui-how-to-stop-data-collection-remove-ads-on-xiaomi-phones/">this post describing the steps required to disable data
collection and ads</a> — and this is just what you can turn off. Who
knows what else it's doing behind the scenes.</p>
<h3 id="lineageos-open-gapps">LineageOS + Open GApps</h3>
<p>I quickly nuked MIUI and installed LineageOS + Open GApps (nano). <a href="https://opengapps.org/">Open GApps</a>
gives you access to some of Google's closed-source apps and libraries,
crucially the Google Play Store. The "Open" part of the name refers to the
open-source scripts the project publishes for the generation of up-to-date
Google Apps packages.</p>
<p>This ROM provides a decent balance between open-source Android and access to the
breadth of the Google Play Store. In hindsight The nano version of Open GApps
includes more Google than I actually want. I think the ideal for me is the pico
package, which is just what's needed to run the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>With this install I attempted to replace the apps that I use most on iOS. For
the following apps I just used the Android version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authy</li>
  <li>Catch.com.au</li>
  <li>Deliveroo</li>
  <li>Discord</li>
  <li>Element (Matrix)</li>
  <li>Fastmail</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Firefox Focus</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Mattermost</li>
  <li>Reddit</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
  <li>Telegram</li>
  <li>Up</li>
  <li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>For these apps I found a replacement that I was mostly happy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts: <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> → <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a></li>
<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitterrific.com/ios/">Twitterrific</a> → <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arthurivanets.owly&amp;hl=en_US">Owly</a></li>

<li>Password Manager: <a href="https://github.com/mssun/passforios">Pass for iOS</a> → <a href="https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store">Password Store</a> + <a href="https://www.openkeychain.org/">OpenKeychain</a></li>
<li>Local Terminal: (null) → <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a></li>
<li>Fediverse: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a> → <a href="https://fedilab.app/">Fedilab</a></li>
<li>Email: Mail.app → Email (default Email app on LineageOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these apps I wasn't able to/have not yet found a replacement that I was
happy with (please <em>don't</em> send me recommendations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather (with <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Meteorology</a> data): <a href="https://weatherperfect.app/">Perfect</a> → ?</li>
<li>Weight tracker:  <a href="https://happyscale.com/">Happy Scale</a> → ?</li>

<li>Fitness tracking: Apple Watch/Activities app → ?</li>
<li>Heart health: <a href="http://heartwatch.tantsissa.com/">HeartWatch</a> → ?</li>
<li>Parcel tracking: <a href="https://parcelapp.net/">Parcel</a> → ?</li>
<li>ApplePay → ?</li>
<li>Netflix
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/bb1xiw/cant_find_netflix_on_the_app_store/">Not available on LineageOS</a>
because it is not, "Play Protect" certified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general I don't find Android apps to be as nice, or as polished as iOS apps.
John and Ben recently discussed this on <a href="https://dithering.fm/">the 9 September episode of
Dithering</a>, which matched my experience. I also really dislike the
visual style and slow animations of the <a href="https://material.io/">Material design language</a>.
Especially the circular animation on tap. The apps I like the most are the ones
that shun the Material style for their own.</p>
<p>Something I learnt from my move to Linux though, was to embrace the platform's
conventions as opposed to trying to reproduce the system you're moving from as
much as possible. So I will put my dislike of Material aside.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption><h4>So Ugly</h4></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One thing I'm not sure I can put aside is the use of the super ugly Noto Color
Emoji font for emoji on Android. On Linux my system emoji font is <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/ttf-joypixels/">JoyPixels</a> and
I go to certain lengths to <a href="https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/github-emoji-linux/">avoid seeing Noto Color Emoji</a>. Almost
any other widely available emoji font would be preferable to me. I did try
side-loading a JoyPixels package when flashing the ROM but couldn't get it to
stick. Apparently something changed in Android 10.</p>
<p>I could "root" the phone and swap out the font file but in the same way
I've never jail-broken an iPhone this is not a path I want to go down right now.
If worst comes to worst I could actually <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/onclite/build">build LineageOS from source</a> and swap
out Noto Color Emoji — what a concept!</p>
<h3 id="lineageos-for-microg">LineageOS for microG</h3>
<p>microG is a library that implements various APIs provided by Google
closed-source libraries in order to be able to run more apps — those that
depend on Google's mapping APIs for example. The microG versions of the APIs
don't rely on Google servers. Critically going down this path you lose access
to Google's push notification servers. Some apps like Telegram work around this
but for the most part you lose notifications.</p>
<p>LineageOS for microG gives a familiar LineageOS experience initially. Instead
of the Google Play Store though, it uses <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, a repository of strictly
free and open-source software. As expected there are far fewer apps available
on F-Droid. Most of the big names are missing.</p>
<p>I think if you were especially principled, were happy to use web apps for
many things (like Twitter), and didn't …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>If you, like me, live in the Bay Area, you may have woken up to something like this last week:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-outside.jpg" alt="Outdoor Air Quality"></p>

<p>This is my back yard, but things looked just as dire in the house:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-inside.jpg" alt="Indoor Air Quality"></p>

<p>If you checked a website, like <a href="https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#8/38.138/-121.702">PurpleAir</a> or <a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=37.86988000000008&amp;lng=-122.27053999999998&amp;zoom=12">AirNow</a>, you would see scary numbers and dire warnings about staying indoors and avoiding the air outside.
However, how <em>is</em> the air inside your house?
Are you actually much safer?</p>

<p>Thankfully, answering this question has gotten cheaper and easier in recent years.
Low-cost air quality sensors have been built into reasonably inexpensive hardware.
The <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/products/purpleair-pa-i-indoor">PurpleAir indoor sensor</a>, for instance, is only $200.</p>

<p>The heart of that device is a plantower laser dust sensor which can be <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32639894148.html">had on AliExpress for about $12</a>.
With PurpleAir, you’re paying for more than just the sensor.
That device includes a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme280-humidity-barometric-pressure-temperature-sensor-breakout">BME280</a> temperature/pressure/humidity sensor, a microcontroller that can access a WiFi network, GPS that helps localize the device on a map, all  conveniently packed into a nice-looking device.
You pay for integration of all that hardware, firmware to make it work together, and software that integrates the data on the back-end and gives you a nice map to view it on.
You’re also paying for hosting to allow PurpleAir to store your data and display it to others.
So, by buying one, you’re not only becoming better-informed, but you’re also helping folks in your neighborhood be better-informed too – a <em>positive</em> externality, for once!</p>

<p>However, if you’re brave enough, there are advantages to building the hardware yourself.
Getting several sensors inside and outside your house can help you understand more about the air you’re breathing.
It can help quantify interventions, like installing an air purifier or running <a href="https://www.texairfilters.com/how-a-merv-13-air-filter-and-a-box-fan-can-help-fight-covid-19/">a box fan</a>.
If you have a large house, you can see how quality differs throughout the house.</p>

<p>Also – while for most readers of this blog, $200 is probably not a lot of money, it <em>is</em> a lot of money for <em>most</em> people.
The folks who are most regularly affected by poor air quality are exactly those who cannot just blow $200 to satisfy their curiosity.
Making air quality monitoring much, much cheaper can potentially make life much better for those people.</p>

<p>This post will help you build a minimum viable sensor that works with your laptop.
By using a pre-existing computer, you can avoid having to pay for additional hardware like a microcontroller with WiFi.
Your computer is probably already on WiFi, so configuration is also minimized.</p>

<p>You can also avoid sending data to a cloud.
This is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, cloud hosting costs are eliminated.
On the other hand, you lose the positive benefits of open data.
Also, if you want visualizations, you have to make them yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the construction!</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>The bill of materials for this project includes two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plantower PMS7003 – maybe <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32784279004.html">this one</a></li>
  <li>A USB-to-TTL cable like <a href="https://amzn.to/2GYAYAD">this one</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This should run you about $20 all-told.
I also needed the following tools and supplies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>soldering iron and solder</li>
  <li>heat shrink tubing and a lighter</li>
  <li>wire clippers/strippers</li>
</ul>

<p>The PMS7003 sensors I had did not come with the little breakout board, and this device has <em>very</em> small pins.
To connect to it, I used some 30AWG wire-wrap wire and a wire-wrapping tool.
If you get a PMS7003 with a breakout and cable, you won’t need this.</p>

<p>My first task was connecting to the PMS7003.
Here’s the pinout, from the <a href="https://download.kamami.com/p564008-p564008-PMS7003%20series%20data%20manua_English_V2.5.pdf">data sheet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-pms7003-pinout.gif" alt="PMS7003 pinout"></p>

<p>You’ll only need 4 wires – for power, ground, serial Tx, and Rx.
I stripped the tiniest bit of insulation on my wire wrap wire, tinned both the wire and the pin, and touched them together with the soldering iron (very carefully, to avoid bridging the pins).</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-wires.jpg" alt="soldering wires"></p>

<p>Here’s a (blurry) photo with all 4 wires connected:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-all-wires.jpg" alt="soldering wires"></p>

<p>Next, I stripped my USB TTL cable and tinned the exposed multi-strand wires.
Tinning just means touching the soldering iron to the wire and allowing some solder to flow onto the wire.
This makes the wire stiff, so I can wire-wrap onto it using my wire-wrap tool.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-usb-ttl-tinned.jpg" alt="USB TTL"></p>

<p>Next, I wire-wrapped the exposed, tinned wires.
Black and Red are for ground and power, and get connected together.
On my TTL cables, <code>green</code> is for <code>Tx</code> (transmit) and <code>white</code> is for <code>Rx</code> (receive).
You need to connect the <code>Tx</code> of the PMS7003 to the <code>Rx</code> of the TTL cable, and vice versa.
I made it easier for myself by making my <code>white</code> wire on the PMS7003 be the <code>Tx</code> pin (Pin9), so I could just do white-to-white:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-wired-up.jpg" alt="Completed Wiring"></p>

<p>After wire-wrapping, I soldered the wires together (belt <em>and</em> suspenders!)
Finally, I put some heat-shrink tubing over the wires and shrunk it using a lighter.
I then taped the device right to the USB plug with electrical tape.
Be sure to avoid covering up the air intake and expel ports on the PMS7003.
Also, be mindful of USB polarity.
The orientation that I have in the photo is probably the way your USB port is aligned on your computer, so the PMS7003 ends up on top of the USB plug.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-complete.jpg" alt="Completeled device"></p>

<p>Here it is, plugged into my computer and ready for software integration:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-in-computer.jpg" alt="Plugged into computer"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Next, you’ll need some software to integrate with this hardware.
The cables that I got use the Prolific Technology PL2303 chipset.
This is already supported on linux; if you plug it in and run <code>dmesg | tail</code> you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[1457958.125315] usb 1-2: new full-speed USB device number 38 using xhci_hcd
[1457958.281810] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=067b, idProduct=2303, bcdDevice= 4.00
[1457958.281816] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[1457958.281820] usb 1-2: Product: USB-Serial Controller
[1457958.281823] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Prolific Technology Inc.
[1457958.283810] pl2303 1-2:1.0: pl2303 converter detected
[1457958.285306] usb 1-2: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like it got recognized correctly, and is available at <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.
On OSX, you will probably have to <a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&amp;pcid=41">install a driver</a>, but you can ignore the warning about restarting your computer.
On these machines, the device will probably show up at <code>/dev/tty.usbserial</code>.</p>

<p>While it has power, the PMS7003 will be outputting a continuous stream of binary data containing the particulate readings onto that TTY device.
The <a href="https://download.kamami.com/p564008-p564008-PMS7003%20series%20data%20manua_English_V2.5.pdf">data sheet</a> specifies the protocol:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-pms7003-protocol.png" alt="PMS7003 protocol"></p>

<p>I recommend using my <a href="https://github.com/igor47/mini-aqm">mini-aqi repo</a>, which includes a Python implementation of this protocol.
You will need a recent python (I tested with <code>3.8.3</code>; anything above <code>3.6</code> should probably work).
Run these commands to grab the repo, install the code, and begin reading data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/igor47/mini-aqm.git
cd mini-aqm/
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run ./main.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you should see the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>beginning to read data from /dev/ttyUSB0...
PM 1.0: 32  PM 2.5: 54  PM 10: 73  AQI: Unhealthy for Certain Groups
PM 1.0: 31  PM 2.5: 54  PM 10: 73  AQI: Unhealthy for Certain Groups
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-screenshot.png" alt="Runtime Screenshot"></p>

<p><code>mini-aqm</code> tries to print informative error messages.
If <code>main.py</code> exits immediately without printing any air quality measurements, read the error message and try to resolve it.
If you suspect a hardware issue, use a multi-meter to check for a short between pins.</p>

<h2 id="visualizations">Visualizations</h2>

<p>I am running <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">telegraf</a> on my laptop.
I’ve configured telegraf to read data from the device and store it in <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/">influxdb</a>, for graphing with <a href="https://grafana.com/">grafana</a>.
Using this stack, here’s a visualization of the past few months of PM data in my workshop:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-last-3-months.png" alt="Last Few Months in Particulates"></p>

<p>Using this setup, it’s convenient to perform experiments and look at results.
For instance, here is what happened with indoor air quality when we turned on our central fan system, which pushes air through two MERV13 filters:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-central-fan.png" alt="Central Air"></p>

<p>Here’s where we take a box fan with a MERV13 filter and run it near the sensor:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-box-fan.png" alt="Box Fan"></p>

<p>Here’s what happens when we just point a normal fan at the device, with no filter:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-normal-fan.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>I noticed that the air quality in my bedroom was not great.
The basement door is right outside my bedroom door, and is pretty leaky, so I started keeping my bedroom door closed.
I also taped over my old, leaky windows with masking tape:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-tape-on-windows.jpg?cache=no" alt="Taped-over windows"></p>

<p>These interventions had a real effect!</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-window-tape-effect.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>Finally, it <em>is</em> possible to have <em>good</em> air quality.
I’m currently sitting in my taped-up room, with doors closed, right next to a box-fan-with-filter:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-getting-to-good.jpg" alt="Good Setup"></p>

<p>The results, with other rooms in the house and outside the house on my Grafana dashboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-all-together.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>Setting up <code>telegraf</code>, <code>influxdb</code>, and <code>grafana</code> is beyond the scope of this post.
If you do go this route, however, the <code>mini-aqm</code> code is already writing a log of collected data into a <code>measurements.log</code> file.
You can run the collector while you’re working on the visualization setup, and then import the “historical” data you’ve collected when you’re done.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’d like to help you breathe better air.
Reach out if you need help building these devices, or have any questions at all.
Also, if you’re in the Bay Area, I have a few spare PMS7003 devices.
If you’d like one without waiting for them to be shipped from China, please reach out, and I can leave one on my porch for you to come grab.</p>

The first, is exceptionally beautiful. The GTO is 60’s car design at it’s very best. However, the second thing is, it’s expensive. The cars are so rare and have so much value, that in 2018, it broke the record for the most expensive car ever sold; when David MacNeil paid $70,000,000 for a 1963 car. With only 39 250 GTOs left in existence, it is understandable why they are of so much value. But soon, we could see a flurry of replica 250’s and kit cars hitting the market. So what’s changed now?</p>
<h5><u>Court Battle</u></h5>
<p>Ferrari had the design of the iconic 250 trademarked, so that no one could produce anything that could, potentially, devalue such an iconic car. However, a bespoke car manufacturer, also based in Modena, called Ares Design, took<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> to the Cancellation division of the EU’s Intellectual Property Office. They put forward the argument that<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> had not put the contested trademark to genuine use for a period of 5 years straight. They argued that the trademark, filed in 2008, was filed in bad faith, and as a defensive mark to block kit cars of the GTO hitting the market; similar to what we see with the AC Cobra and the many modern versions of the Lotus Seven.</p>

<p>In Article 58(1)(a) EUTMR, an EU trademark can be revoked if not used genuinely within a period of 5 years.<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> had not used it, and considering that they had filed a trademark in 2007 for a design that hadn’t been used in over 50 years, it didn’t appear<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> would use it.<br>
<u><br>
The Outcome</u></p>
<p>In short,<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ares-design/" title="Ares Design"> Ares Design</a> won. The trademark has been revoked in the context of proper cars.<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> still hold a trademark for scale models of the GTO. The EU ruling is certainly an interesting one, given that 2 years ago, there was a similar lawsuit between the same two companies. It was heard by a court in Bologna, which declared the GTO a work of art that could not be imitated or reproduced.</p>

<p>This leaves us in an interesting place. Whilst the GTO is a timeless classic, perhaps the ultimate classic car, I hate the idea of shoddy replicas being made that don’t do the real car justice. However, companies such as<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ares-design/" title="Ares Design"> Ares Design</a> clearly would make quality replicas, based off the stunning work that they do already. While many may disagree, I do think that there’s a place for high quality 1:1 replicas, especially in motorsport. These days, barely any 250s are seen on track, as they’re too valuable. A replica would look and sound the same, but not have as much value. This would give us an insight into the incredible GTO in its natural habitat, that we just don’t get to see in the modern day.</p>

	<section>
<p><span>I became fascinated with guilds when I moved to Germany. Being an avid reader of all medieval history I could get my hands on, I was well aware of the <em>Hansa</em> (slang for Hanseatic) League’s rise in the 1100s in northern Europe – mainly Germany. The word&nbsp;<em>Hansa</em> is Low German for “convoy” – thus, this league of towns and merchant houses was a consolidated group of merchants and businessmen who strove to create their own answer to feudal Europe. The members of the League had their own legal system, their own armies, and had direct allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Landed Barons and Earls did not stand a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>The rise of these independent towns and merchants also gave rise to the guild system. Where the Hansa League was a merchant’s guild, craft guilds began in a like manner around the same time period. The craft guilds were a system to protect knowledge that heretofore had been handed down by father to son, or nephew, or random laborer. Prior to the rise of larger towns and cities, just after the Dark Ages, it was difficult to form a “convoy” of skilled craftsmen because there was no system or codification of work. As towns grew, and more independent towns grew, the need for a steady flow of crafts began. Thus, craft guilds provided the goods and merchants fed the need: the beginning of real capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Both types of guilds, Merchants and Craftsmen provided a variety of important functions, very similar: “They established a monopoly of trade in their locality or within <img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3938" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds1/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg" data-orig-size="962,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NX530\/NX635\/BX535\/SX535&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=639" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422" alt="guilds1" width="271" height="422" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422 271w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=542&amp;h=844 542w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=96&amp;h=150 96w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192&amp;h=300 192w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px">a particular branch of industry or commerce; they set and maintained standards for the quality of goods and the&nbsp;<a id="___id15" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp;of trading practices in that industry; they worked to maintain stable prices for their goods and commodities; and they sought to control town or city governments in order to further the interests of the guild members and achieve their economic objectives.” <em>(Encyclopedia Britannica)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The craft guilds are of interest to Freemasons and those interested in Freemasonry because they have like terms. The use of the terms of Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master is well known, with slight variation, to Freemasons as well as to any member of a guild in the middle ages in Europe. These were the common terms to designate the proficiency of a laborer.&nbsp;Guilds in Medieval Europe employed the apprenticeship system of hierarchy, which has its origins in the Roman Empire and possibly Mesopotamia.&nbsp; From young ages, boys (and in some cases women, depending on the profession) were brought in to learn the craft, ensuring that an adequate number of skilled craftsmen were able to supply the growing towns with goods and services of equal and competitive quality. Standardization and quality were the driving force behind a steady stream of apprentices bonded to masters, and journeymen sent out to learn their craft.</span></p>
<p><span>The Apprentice was one who “apprehends” or takes hold of learning. One might also say it is one who is taken hold of, as he is bound to a Master to learn his trade. The term Apprentice does come from the Latin root of “apprehend,” and it does indicate in the <img data-attachment-id="3935" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds4/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg" data-orig-size="307,321" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=307" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=639" alt="guilds4" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg 307w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=143 143w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287 287w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px">most basic terms “someone learning.” An Apprentice was one who learned for a specified amount of time, learning specific skills and techniques of both hand and mind. He was, however, not allowed to be an official member of the guild until he had satisfied the requirements set out by the guild and even more importantly, by his Master.</span></p>
<p><span>The word Journeyman has a more interesting etymology. A Journeyman is someone who does work for “another.” That is, he is an Apprentice who has been sent out into the world to work, generally for other Masters or shops. An original meaning of the word “journey” was “a day” and a Journeyman was someone who performed work for a day and then moved on, as it were. The Journeyman was no longer bonded to a single Master and could choose the work they wished to do. The Journeyman’s former Master, however, still guaranteed the Journeyman’s character and abilities. Shame on the Journeyman meant shame to the Master, and to the guild in which the Journeyman had become a member. Perfection in work and bearing meant the same perfection to the associated Master and Guild.</span></p>
<p><span>Master is an even more interesting term as used in the same time period (mid-16th Century) as these other two definitions. At this time, the term Master meant “one who controls or has authority.” It also meant “one who subjugates.” This means that a Master has perfected and honed his skills to the point of being competent in all areas of his craft, under all variety of conditions, with a variety of materials. A guild member might go their whole life being a Journeyman; Master’s were few and far between. A Master, then, is partially self-determined and partially a bestowed title.&nbsp;“A journeyman who could provide proof of his technical competence (the “masterpiece”) might rise in the guild to the status of a master, whereupon he could set up his own workshop and hire and train apprentices. The masters in any particular craft guild tended to be a select inner circle<em><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3936" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds3/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif" data-orig-size="447,434" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=447" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=221&amp;h=214" alt="guilds3" width="221" height="214"></em> who possessed not only technical competence but also proof of their wealth and social position.”&nbsp;<em>(Encyclopedia Britannica)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that the main function of the guild was not to produce goods or fix techniques ‘per se’ – those were supporting roles to the main function of the guild. The guild existed to serve a singular purpose:&nbsp;to train Apprentices. Bringing in and bonding Apprentices ensured a continuity of quality workmanship, consistent goods being produced, and traditions being maintained. Thus, the role of the Guild was not to form rules, mores, regulations, and laws with respect to their crafts; their role was to introduce a system of art or craft to a new individual, to instill in them the idea of standards, quality, consistency, and perfection. Their goal was to expand their horizons and technical knowledge in a specific area so they might provide for their towns as well as their families. Guilds and guild members served the community as much as they served themselves.</span></p>

		<p>Repl.it is already the best place to build your apps. But there was a missing piece: where do you store your data?</p>
<p>We’re introducing Repl.it Database: a fast, free, and easy key-value store that’s built into every repl.</p>
<p>All you have to do is import one of our packages for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>, and you can instantly start setting keys in your database.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>Because Database is built-in, there is no setup, provisioning, or configuration. It's the fastest and easiest way to store data on Repl.it.</p>
<p>To get off the ground, fork our <a href="https://repl.it/@util/Database-Flask-comments-example">example Python and Flask emoji app</a> so that you can quickly get to hacking!</p>


<h2 id="key-value">Key-value</h2>
<p>Key-value databases are conceptually simple: they’re a flat map of keys to their values. There are no schemas, tables, or columns. There are only a few operations that you need to perform: set a key to a value, get a key’s value, delete a key, and search for keys.</p>
<p>Those simple operations are enough to support all kinds of applications, from blogs with posts and comments, to game backends with leaderboards, to <a href="https://repl.email/">email platforms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="multi-language">Multi-language</h2>
<p>We provide Database clients for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>. But you can talk to Database from any language over HTTP. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In Python, our client serializes and deserializes dictionaries and lists so that you can use them to store more complex data:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database2.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>Repl.it is the best place to start building your app. And Database is the easiest way to just jump in, get coding, and store your data without having to set anything up.</p>
<p>For more details on Database, click on the Database icon in your repl’s sidebar or <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">check out the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>With Database, you can build a fully-featured app entirely on Repl.it. We can’t wait to see what you create!</p>

With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

				<div>
				
<p>This past week 10 people were killed by police in Colombia as demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest police violence following the killing of a 46-year-old father by police in Bogotá.</p>



<p>A video of the incident shared on social media shows Javier Ordonez pleading officers to stop tasering him. He would later die while in the hospital.</p>



<p>In a country that is less than a year removed from <a href="https://latinamericareports.com/in-photos-bogota-students-protest-against-police-violence/3463/">massive protests</a> against police violence, the killing has sent protestors back out into the streets. In addition to those killed, nearly 250 people were injured during the demonstrations in Colombia’s capital. </p>



<p>Though the widespread protests of police brutality in the United States this year have caught the world’s attention, Latin America is no stranger to deadly and unjustified actions by its police forces.</p>



<p>In Rio de Janeiro police killed more than 600 people in the first four months of this year alone. Despite crime and violence dropping during COVID-19 lockdowns, police violence grew, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/03/brazil-suffers-its-own-scourge-police-brutality">according to Human Rights Watch</a>. As in the United States, a disproportionate amount of those being killed by police are black men.</p>



<p>“While Covid-19 will affect favela residents for a long time, effective public health policies can help bring it under control. But as long as officers responsible for reckless shootings and cold-blooded executions are not held accountable, we’ll keep losing innocent young people in Rio de Janeiro, with no end in sight,” wrote Human Rights Watch researcher César Muñoz.</p>



<p>Last year, protests erupted in Chile concerning social inequality in the country, which were marred by more than 800 cases of police using excessive force. A local human rights institute in Chile reported at least six killings by police.</p>



<p>And in Mexico, a video went viral showing the violent police arrest of a 30-year-old man in Jalisco for not wearing a face mask. That man later died in police custody, marking a clear parallel to the recent incident in Colombia.</p>



<p>That incident, coupled with a string of abuses by police, led to massive protests in June in cities throughout the country.</p>



<p>“Mexico’s police forces are infamous for their corruption, their use of torture and violence, and their ties to organized crime,” said&nbsp;José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas regional director of Human Rights Watch in a release. “These protests, which echo the global wave of outrage sparked by the police&nbsp;killing of George Floyd&nbsp;in the US, also express the profound and longstanding mistrust and frustration that many Mexicans feel toward their abusive police forces.”</p>



<p>Protests in Bolivia and Ecuador last year, on top of the aforementioned ones in Chile and Colombia, <a href="https://latinamericareports.com/excessive-police-violence-protests-deaths-injuries/3917/">led to at least 50 deaths</a> due to conflict between government security forces and protestors.</p>



<p>Colombia’s current protests show a continued, unsettling trend of police violence that keeps galvanizing young people to take to the streets. And with high rates of police impunity across the region, no justice is in sight.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-2308">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
        		<h3>MD and mdadm<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>MD is the Linux kernel driver that is used for running software RAID arrays. <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> is the software that you run to manage MD devices. They are both part of the same project.</p>
<h3>First, about the Bad Blocks List<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>Since about 2010, MD has had a bad blocks log (BBL) feature. When it fails to read from an underlying device it will (sometimes?) mark that block as bad and read the correct data from a different device, and then forever more redirect reads away from those bad blocks. <strong>This feature defaults to being on</strong>.</p>
<p>One problem with this feature is that read errors can occur for many reasons besides permanent failure of part of a storage device. For example, it could be a failure of the backplane or controller that causes many read errors on multiple devices, or the devices could be reached over a network of some sort and temporary network problems could propagate errors.</p>
<p>Even if the particular part of the device is unreadable, the operating system is supposed to try to write the correct data over the top. This write will either clear the problem or else be redirected to a spare sector on the drive by the drive’s firmware. The operating system is not supposed to be taking on this role, the drives are, and when the drives fail to do so then the redundancy of the array is supposed to save the day.</p>
<p>Even worse, there are apparently bugs somewhere in the BBL code that cause a device’s BBL to be copied onto a new device when the array is rebuilt or a device replaced. Clearly it does not make sense for a new device to get a copy of another device’s BBL because they are inherently a per-device thing. So far there has been no successful intentional reproduction of this, only people unwittingly hitting it at the worst possible moments.</p>
<p><strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> doesn’t even try particularly hard to warn you if a new bad block is found. Unlike when a device fails, it doesn’t send you an email. The MD driver writes in the syslog about the bad block(s). There’s also no change to <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong>. You have to examine some files in sysfs.</p>
<p>As a result the current situation is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65522.html">some people who want the feature removed</a> as a bad idea that makes no sense in the modern era;</li>
<li>there’s <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65524.html">others</a> <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg51381.html">who</a> want it defaulted to off;</li>
<li>there’s the RAID wiki which says that <a href="https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/The_Badblocks_controversy">the feature has merit but it also has bugs which must be fixed</a>;</li>
<li>there’s probably a very large number of mdadm users who have no opinion because they have no idea about this situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one seems to have made any progress on fixing any of this in 10 years.</p>
<h3>Doing something about it<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>I’ll say right now that this story doesn’t (yet?) have a satisfying ending.</p>
<p>I’ve been aware of the “Bad Blocks Controversy” for about 5 years but I haven’t ever personally experienced any problems and it was always at the bottom of my list to look at. <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65522.html">Roy’s recent thread</a> spurred me into deciding that in future no MD array I created would have a BBL.</p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to deploy Sarah Newman’s <a href="https://github.com/prgmrcom/ansible-role-mdadm-bad-blocks">Ansible role which checks all array components have an empty BBL</a>. None of <a href="https://bitfolk.com/">BitFolk</a>‘s array components currently have any entries in their BBLs – phew!</p>
<h4>Removing an existing BBL<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>Currently the only way to remove a BBL from an array component is to stop the array and then assemble it with an argument like this:</p>

<div><div><pre># mdadm --assemble /dev/mdX --update=no-bbl</pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="http://strugglers.net/~andy/blog/2020/09/13/debian-installer-mdadm-configuration-and-the-bad-blocks-controversy/comment-page-1/#comment-1017218">This won’t work if a BBL currently has any entries</a>)</p>
<p>The big problem with this is that stopping the array obviously causes downtime for whatever is using it. If your root filesystem is on an MD array (and why wouldn’t it be, if you use MD?) then that means the entire server, and you’re having to do this from sort of rescue environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65835.html">I have suggested that a config option be added</a> to remove a BBL on assembly, so that this will happen the next time the machine is rebooted. This does not appear to have provoked any interest.</p>
<p>Without that sort of assistance I don’t think I will be removing the BBL from any of my existing arrays — downtime is really painful and I can’t justify spending the extra time to boot into a rescue environment and manually assemble all arrays.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24479235">Over on Hacker News Jakub Wilk said</a> that it could be done without downtime by faulting out an array member and adding it again, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre># mdadm /dev/md127 --fail /dev/sda --remove /dev/sda --re-add /dev/sda --update=no-bbl</pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately that didn’t work for me, neither on Ubuntu 18.04 nor Debian buster:</p>

<div><div><pre>$ sudo mdadm --fail /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 --remove /dev/sdb1 --re-add /dev/sdb1 --update=no-bbl                                        
mdadm: set /dev/sdb1 faulty in /dev/md0   
mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb1 from /dev/md0
mdadm: --re-add for /dev/sdb1 to /dev/md0 is not possible
$ sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 --update=no-bbl
mdadm: --update in Manage mode only allowed with --re-add.
$ sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
$ sudo mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sdb1
Bad-blocks list is empty in /dev/sdb1</pre></div></div>

<p>so I’m still looking in to that one.</p>
<h4>Avoiding the BBL at creation time<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>So if the BBL cannot be easily removed, at least it can be prevented from ever existing, right? When Neil Brown, the previous MD maintainer, was asked in 2016 if the feature could be defaulted to off, <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg51383.html">Neil said that putting this in the config file was as good as that</a>:</p>



<p>The thing is, it’s not as good as disabling it by default when you consider what many users’ experience is of running the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> command: they don’t run <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong>, something else runs it for them. I’d go as far as to say that the majority of uses of <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> are done by helper scripts and installers, not by human beings.</p>
<p>If it’s a program that is running <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> for you then you are going to have to find out how to set that <strong>mdadm.conf</strong> before it reads it.</p>
<p>Take for example my own process of installing <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a>. I do it by booting the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller">Debian Installer</a> <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s05">by PXE</a>. I have some pre-seeding done to answer a lot of the installer questions, but actually I do still do the disk partitioning stage in the installer’s text interface.</p>
<p>So there I was thinking this is actually going to be quite simple, because the Debian Installer is really lovely about letting you execute a shell and poke around. Surely all I am going to need to do is open a shell once and edit <strong>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong> and then go back into the mdcfg menu and carry on, right? Oh dear me no.</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2020/09/msg00074.html">You can read the details of my wild ride</a> that involved me uploading a binary of <strong><code>strace</code></strong> into the d-i to run <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> under to work out what was going on, but just the relevant discoveries are in this article for those who’d rather not.</p>
<h5><strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> in d-i uses a config file at <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></h5>
<p>After quite a bit of confusion over why even arrays I created manually with the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> command in the d-i shell still had a BBL, I discovered that <a href="https://sources.debian.org/src/mdadm/4.1-6/debian/rules/?hl=37#L37">the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> binary in d-i is compiled to have its config at <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></a>. I don’t know why, but probably there is a good reason.</p>
<p>(At this point a number of people responded, “that’s because everything else will be set read-only.” That’s not the case with debian-installer which runs entirely off of a tmpfs. It’s all writeable.)</p>
<h5>So just make the edit to <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong> then?</h5>
<p>Oh ho ho no. <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/mdcfg/-/blob/master/mdcfg.sh#L443">Every time you go into the MD configuration section (mdcfg) it clobbers its own <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></a>, and you can’t get to the “execute a shell” option without returning to the MD configuration section.</p>
<p>If you’re on something with multiple virtual consoles (like if you’re sitting in front of a conventional PC) then you could switch to one of those after you’ve entered the MD configuration part and modify <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong> then. I don’t have that option because I’m on a serial console.</p>
<p>There is an earlier option to load an installer component that enables one to continue the installation process over SSH. If you select that then you can SSH in to the running installer system so if you do that after you’ve entered the MD configuration bit in your main console then I guess you can then edit the config file and continue.</p>
<p>At this point though it’s all becoming a bit complicated. I was trying to avoid it but <strong>realistically I recommend just creating your MD arrays manually from the d-i shell</strong>. It’s less weirdness to remember.</p>
<p>If it’s a simple case where you’ve just got an <strong>sda</strong> and an <strong>sdb</strong> disk identically partitioned and you want to make a bunch of arrays on them, it can be a fairly legible shell session like:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mkdir -vp /etc/mdadm &amp;&amp; echo "CREATE bbl=no" &gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
~ # for part in 1 2 3 5; do \
      mdadm --create \
            -v \
            --config=/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf \
            /dev/md${part} \
            --level=1 \

<p>Do not try this until you understand exactly what it is doing.</p>
<p>It iterates the list 1, 2, 3, 5 (I use the 4th partition for something else) and makes arrays called <strong>mdX</strong> out of <strong>sdaX</strong> and <strong>sdbX</strong>. The <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> binary is forced to use our config file that disables creation of a BBL.</p>
<p>You can verify that a BBL does not exist on any of the array components like this:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sda1
No bad-blocks list configured on /dev/sda1</pre></div></div>

<p>You should get identical output for every component. If a component <em>did</em> have a BBL it would output something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sda1
Bad-blocks list is empty in /dev/sda1</pre></div></div>

<p>You can then exit the d-i shell and go back to the disk partitioning section. You won’t need the MD configuration part now but even if you do go into it, it should detect all your manually-created arrays.</p>
<h4>How to make progress?<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>All of this isn’t great but at least it’s fairly easy to pause the Debian installer and take some manual action. I suspect users of other Linux distributions may not be so lucky, and so I too think it would be a good idea if this buggy feature was disabled by default, or at least if there were a way to tell <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> to remove the BBL on assembly.</p>
<p>In fact I would very much like to be able to tell it to remove the BBL on assembly so that I can disable the BBL feature on …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>This post shows how I upgraded the power delivery to my home server room, as well as installing the infrastructure to replace 5 UPS's around my house with just one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Why Upgrade the power?</strong></p><p>The electrical in my home when I moved in was terrible, it was also Aluminum and has been incorrectly terminated by some house flipper, here is a great example of what I have come up against. Do you really want to use this outlet? Probably not.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-17_12.40.16.jpg"></figure><p>The 15a circuit that powers the server room was also shared with the <em>refrigerator </em>for some reason. I have a pretty large fridge which pulls quite a lot of power when the compressor kicks on, this means my inbox is spammed with emails from my UPS complaining about the spikes in power when the compressor turns on and off</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-11-10_30_31-Inbox---sean@bondhou.com---Outlook.png"></figure><p>I finally reached the end when I charged some Milwaukee batteries in the server closet and it tripped the breaker, I decided to go all out and get a ton of power in the room.</p><p><strong>Why the multi room UPS setup? </strong></p><p>There are many reasons this makes sense, this addresses all of the issues I had with my old setup of having UPS's scattered around the house.</p><p><strong>Batteries</strong></p><p>No longer will I have to keep track of batteries in 5 different UPS's all with different expiration dates. It will also save me money as the total number of batteries is much less in one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Noise</strong></p><p>This seems crazy, but some UPS's like the APC SMT line make a slight hum all the time, its very quiet but in a silent room you can hear it, this is super annoying. With this setup the UPS can be as loud as it wants, its in my server rack in its own room</p><p><strong>Space</strong></p><p>Do I really want 2 UPS's sitting under my desk? No. It also lets me cable manage much better</p><p><strong>Load</strong></p><p>When me and my wife are playing PC games, the load can get to the upper limit of a single UPS, meaning I'd have to buy a second one, and then both UPS's would be only half loaded. By having one large UPS, I can size it properly for all the loads</p><p>There could be some drawbacks though, here is all I could come up with</p><p><strong>Single Point of failure</strong></p><p>By having one large UPS, if the UPS fails, everything goes down. I decided this was okay, as my entire network lives in the closet and is only powered by a single UPS anyway, so if the network goes down, everything else is essentially down anyway. So I felt like there really wasn't any increased risk here. Also, UPS's in general are pretty bulletproof, especially enterprise grade units.</p><p><strong>Code compliance</strong></p><p>There are several points here that probably don't comply with code. The fact that an extension cord has been brought into a permanent circuit is probably one of them. I decided this wasn't a real risk as that SOOW cord is 1000x tougher than romex. I would argue that romex in the wall is of greater risk of getting damaged from someone running a screw or a nail to hang a picture frame</p><p>9/14/2020 Update - I believe this is actually to code - <a href="https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0">https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0</a></p><p>The other one is that the outlets are now not AFCI protected. I am unsure if the UPS protects against this, but I don't think it does. This could possibly be resolved by running the UPS from an AFCI breaker, but I am unsure. Either way I don't really care about this part, the chance of that kind of failure is low, especially when I did a good job installing everything. Its also still a 1000000x safety improvement over the old wiring in the room</p><p>There also could be something said for the fact that if you shut the breaker off, the power keeps flowing from the UPS. This however is only a risk to people who don't know about the setup, and since its my house, everyone does. If I were to sell the house, I could simply remove the inlets.</p><p><strong>The Install</strong></p><p>First I had to figure out how exactly I was going to get UPS power from my server closet, to somewhere else. I found you can get pretty cheap Power Inlets which are often used for block heaters on cars, and for RV power inputs. I got one of these and drilled a hole in a blank metal wall plate, and made a pretty good inlet</p><p>You can buy this kind of thing pre-made for flush TV mounting, but they seem lower quality and are way more expensive.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.51.58.JPG"></figure><p>I got the highest quality extension cord ends I could find so this would be fine plugged in 24/7. These are in there SUPER tight.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.52.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.06.46.JPG"></figure><p>I then got myself a reel of 12/3 SOOW cable. This stuff is SUPER thick and SUPER tough. Its overkill for this in every way, but given that these will be hanging on the floor in the server room, I figured the tougher the better. As it turns out, buying good quality USA made extension cords is pretty much impossible, so you have to make your own</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-30-10.46.44.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.04.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.09.JPG"></figure><p>The downside with these super heavy duty cord ends is that they don't fit well in compact locations, like when I was testing with this SMT1500 UPS. As you can see, you can't use the outlets above and below</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.07.19.JPG"></figure><p>Next I had to find a way to mount all of these in the wall, plus the regular power oulets I wanted to run. Since they rely on the single metal plates, I can't use a 4 gang box that attaches to the stud. In the end I decided to use a piece of 3/4" inch plywood paired with some old work boxes that just clip into the hole. The ply wood will span the studs and get screwed in</p><p>I measured everything out, cut some holes with a holesaw and then finished up with my jigsaw</p><p>I decided I wanted the 4 inlets, a single gang for the 30a power I will supply, and two double boxes for the 20a circuits</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.45.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.13.JPG"></figure><p>Then I cut out the drywall in the server room, plus another hole on the other side to make thing easier. The hole on the other side was more to scout the correct position in the server room, and you could probably skip it</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.36.08.JPG"></figure><p>With that done, I simply screwed it in with 4 screws and inserted the old work boxes. As you can see, I also spray painted the wood white to somewhat match the wall</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.27.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.24.JPG"></figure><p>Its not the neatest thing in the world, but honestly it doesn't have to be.</p><p>I brought the cables down through the top of the wall through a few 1/2 holes. I used 12/2 Romex for all of the inlets and the 20a power circuits, and 10/2 for the 30a</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-11.29.20.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.04.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.03.10.JPG"></figure><p>Here it is with everything installed and labeled up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.26.22.JPG"></figure><p>I went with the 30a in the middle for a large UPS, and then decided to pull 2 x 20a circuits. One for the server rack in general (Currently I don't have the 30a UPS) and then also an extra one for general use. This lets me plug whatever I want in, without affecting the power to the rack</p><p>Some may ask why the outlets are installed upside-down, its common in commercial settings to do this as it means if the cord sags down, only the ground prong will be exposed. Things can also get lodged between the two hot prongs if the outlet is the normal way up, like this from an image I stole from reddit</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/image.png"></figure><p>Here is the first test of the UPS power</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.25.03.JPG"></figure><p>And then all the way on the other side of the house, the dedicated outlet under the desk lights up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.24.40.JPG"></figure><p>Overall I am super pleased with how this has turned out. </p><p>If anyone has any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me from the contact page</p>

        <p><strong>We’d like an easy way to judge open-source programs. It can be done. But easily? That’s another matter. When it comes to open source, you can’t rely on star power.</strong></p>
<p>The “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140708-when-crowd-wisdom-goes-wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisdom of the crowd</a>” has inspired all sorts of online services wherein people share their opinions and guide others in making choices. The Internet community has created many ways to do this, such as Amazon reviews, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor</a> (where you can rate employers), and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="https://yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp</a> (for hotels, restaurants, and other service providers). You can rate or recommend commercial software, too, such as on mobile app stores or through sites like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product hunt</a>. But if you want advice to help you choose open-source applications, the results are disappointing.</p>
<p>It isn’t for lack of trying. Plenty of people have created systems to collect, judge, and evaluate open-source projects, including information about a project’s popularity, reliability, and activity. But each of those review sites – and their methodologies – have flaws.</p>
<p>Take that most archaic of programming metrics: Lines of code (LoC). Yes, it’s easy to measure. But <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-myth-of-100-code-coverage/">it’s also profoundly misleading</a>. As programming genius Edsger Dijkstra observed in 1988, LoC gives people “<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the reassuring illusion that programs are just devices like any others</a>, the only difference admitted being that their manufacture might require a new type of craftsmen, viz. programmers. From there it is only a small step to measuring ‘programmer productivity’ in terms of ‘number of lines of code produced per month.’ This is a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code.”</p>
<p>We’ve gotten better since then, haven’t we? Perhaps not.</p>
<h3>First attempts</h3>
<p>In 1997, well-known developer Patrick Lenz founded the first listing and announcement site for free and open-source software, freshmeat.net. It was meant to be <em>the</em> guide to open-source programs. But freshmeat never lived up to its promise.</p>
<p>Due to changes in direction and ownership, <a href="https://jeffcovey.net/2014/06/19/freshmeat-net-1997-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freshmeat sputtered into failure</a>. In the end, no one really had a clear idea of how to monetize the site.</p>
<p>Freshmeat was quickly followed by <a href="http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freecode</a>. This site’s mission was to maintain the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031160805/http:/freecode.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web’s largest index of Linux, Unix, and cross-platform software</a> and mobile applications.” It explained, “Each entry provides a description of the software, links to download it and to obtain more information, and a history of the project’s releases, so readers can keep up-to-date on the latest developments.” You could think of Freecode as an open-source software-specific version of Yahoo’s first iteration as a guide to the web.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the site slowly came to a stop – and then halted entirely. Its owners declared, “The Freecode site has been moved to a static state effective June 18, 2014, due to low traffic levels and so that folks will focus on more useful endeavors than site upkeep.”</p>
<p>Open-source co-creator <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric S. Raymond tried to revive Freecode.</a> Raymond believed no other site was “quite so good for getting a cross-sectional view of what the open-source world is doing.” From his perspective, Freecode had numerous but fixable, problems. Among them: cutting down on human moderation, focusing exclusively on open-source software, and paring it down to essential features. Alas, his efforts came to little. The site remains a static antique.</p>
<h3>Case in point: GitHub</h3>
<p>Today, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Stars</a> is presented as a quick, easy way to evaluate the virtues of an open-source program. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the biggest open-source Git repository, describes its star system as just a way to keep track of projects people find interesting. However, many developers use the stars as a way of boosting their reputations.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the more stars, the better the software. Or is it?</p>
<p>Solomon Hykes, Docker’s co-founder, strongly disagrees. “<a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1294189350419181575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1294189350419181575%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fi9rtbb%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub stars are a scam.</a> This bullshit metric is so pervasive, and GitHub’s chokehold on the open-source community so complete, that maintainers have to distort their workflows to fit the ‘GitHub model’ or risk being publicly shamed by industry analysts. What a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Hykes isn’t the only one who views GitHub stars as a misleading flop. Fintan Ryan, a Gartner senior director, thinks <a href="https://twitter.com/fintanr/status/1294173608558952448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stars are just a game</a> that confuses marketing and the code that’s actually on GitHub. And Microsoft project manager for open-source development on Azure, Ralph Squillace, tweeted, “In my opinion and for Microsoft project [engineering] and management <a href="https://twitter.com/ralph_squillace/status/1294196384237785088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they are worthless</a>. [But] There are always people who seize on them anyway.”</p>
<p>And that’s the problem. People love easy metrics. They want a quick, one-glance <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-personality-traits-affect-the-open-source-development-process/">answer to their coding (and other) problems</a>. Spoiler alert: There is no such thing.</p>
<h3>Opening the code: Open Hub</h3>
<p>Still, some sites and services provide valuable insights into a project’s overall health. Many of those websites, such as <a href="https://github.com/features/insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Insights</a>, a commercial standalone application for <a href="https://github.com/enterprise#github-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub One</a> customers, are restricted to project’s development managers rather than outsiders looking in on a project.</p>
<p>One service that does give everyone a look into open-source projects is <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synopsys</a>‘s <a href="https://www.openhub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Duck Open Hub</a>, formerly Ohloh. By searching on the site, anyone can dive deep into major projects to see who’s doing what in a given open-source application’s version control system.</p>
<p>While Open Hub doesn’t give you simple answers about a project, it does share such important information as security vulnerabilities per the last ten versions; the number of commits per month; and the number of recently active developers. You can determine a project’s most active developers, too. Armed with this data, you can come to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/from-the-qa-trenches-6-signs-of-project-success-or-failure/">your own conclusions about a particular project’s worthiness</a>.</p>
<h3>Simple tools for complex answers: Google Trends</h3>
<p>Let’s say you want to know which open-source program is the most popular for a given need. Thanks to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>, comparing projects is easier to determine than you might think.</p>
<p>For instance, one eternal open-source debate is whether <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice</a> or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice</a> is the better open-source office suite. Its relative quality may remain open to question, but by comparing searches for both programs, you can see in a jiffy that LibreOffice shows up in searches on average more than twice as often as OpenOffice.</p>
<p>That only scratches the surface. You can also use the service’s time range option to find that <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=LibreOffice,OpenOffice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice has been more popular than OpenOffice since late 2016</a>. (Which, as it happens, is a few months after I declared LibreOffice the victor between the two.)</p>
<p>Or, to pick a more enterprise-oriented search, when it comes to container orchestration, we all know <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes is the winner</a>. But, when did it become clear that it was going to beat <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Swarm Mode</a> and <a href="https://d2iq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mesosphere, now D2IQ</a>? One Google Trend search later, and you see that by the spring of 2016, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Kubernetes,Docker%20Swarm,Mesosphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes had already grabbed a large lead</a> in container orchestration mindshare.</p>
<p>Finally, Google Trends is also good when you want to look at what hasn’t happened yet. For example, “breakouts” are sudden rises of traffic on a specific search term. By doing a general search on “technology,” I found the top breakout term was one I’d never even heard of—although I make my living from tracking what’s hot in tech: Transportation as a Service (TaaS). Keep an eye on it; interest is high.</p>
<h3>Moving to a new model of judging open-source software</h3>
<p>It would be great if there were a genuinely useful rating system that would help people discover excellent but less-visible open-source projects. But an easy way to work out which of the tens of thousands of projects are the vital, important ones – a software Yelp, if you will – doesn’t exist. It may never come to be.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal. Brian Profitt, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Hat</a>‘s Open Source Program Office (OSPO) manager, is working with others on a new project to make it easy to evaluate open-source projects: <a href="https://chaoss.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project CHAOSS</a>. This Linux Foundation project is devoted to creating analytics and metrics that help define open-source community health.</p>
<p>“Since I started working at Red Hat, figuring out a way to quantifiably measure community health has been a priority for my team,” Profitt explains. “At first, we took a mega-dashboard approach, using the tools provided by the Spanish vendor <a href="https://bitergia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitergia</a>. They use open-source projects like <a href="https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimoirelabs</a> to put together amazing dashboards that give daily updated reports on how our stewarded projects were doing.”</p>
<p>However, like the other efforts we’ve been discussing, this approach ran into trouble. This time it’s too much information. “Most of our community managers did not have the time to analyze this firehose of data and make meaningful decisions based on this,” Profitt says.</p>
<p>So Red Hat also began working on Project CHAOSS. This pulled together Grimoirelab and similar programs, such as <a href="http://www.augurlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augur</a> and Red Hat’s own <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/prospector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospector</a>. CHAOSS has two sides: People working on software applications, and “others working on what things could be defined as part of a community’s health,” Profitt says. “In the past, the argument was always, ‘Well, my community is different because of X, so you can’t judge us by the same standards as Y.’”</p>
<p>Profitt and CHAOSS disagree with such an argument. “Look at a small hamlet in rural China. Look at a mega-city in Europe. Both communities, but vastly different, right? Except they both have to have ways to deal with water, food, sanitation. They both have to have ways of getting around. Yes, in the hamlet it could be bicycles on a dirt road, and in the big city, it will be streets, highways, trams, subways. But at a fundamental level, the health of the community only depends on if the appropriate level of transportation is available, not what kind.”</p>
<p>While the focus is on community,<a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CHAOSS’s metrics</a> can be used by project managers and maintainers as well. Its metrics include <a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-types-of-contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what kinds of contributions are being made</a>; <a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/#user-content-focus-area---when" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when the contributions are made</a>; and <a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/#user-content-focus-area---who" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who’s making the contributions</a>. All of which are vital to understanding the overall health of a project.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>
  <p>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.
My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren’t, so there’s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.
Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</p>
<p>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter.
What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</p>
<p>To start, an observation.
A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (<a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> being one example I can’t live without).
And these languages are objectively bad.
This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.
While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it’s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn’t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different <code>null</code>s).</p>
<p>This is a general rule — as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.
Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn’t seem super relevant.
It’s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</p>
<p>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.
If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.
If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.
Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</p>
<p>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.
The quality of the language itself is secondary.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let’s see some examples which can be “explained” by this theory.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>
<p>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.
First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.
It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.
Second, C is the language of Unix.
(And yes, I would put C into the “easily improved upon” category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</p>
</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.
A common explanation for Java’s popularity is “marketing by Sun”, and subsequent introduction of Java into University’s curricula.
This doesn’t seem convincing to me.
Let’s look at the 90’s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://matklad.github.io/assets/lang-pop.png" alt="lang pop">
</p>

</div>
<p>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.
That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).
This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go</dt>
<dd>
<p>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.
In a sense, Go is an upgrade over “memory safe &amp; reasonably fast” Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.
One is scripting languages.
A highly dynamic runtime with <code>eval</code> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.
However, it’s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</p>
<p>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don’t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make some bold predictions using the theory.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)
This needs some explanation — on the first, blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.
But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, I predict Julia to become more popular.
It’s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy">Ousterhout’s Dichotomy</a> and insisting that, yeah, we’ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dart grows.
On the one hand, it’s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.
But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.
Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.
Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won’t grow much outside of it, <em>despite</em> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s assume you made a static website made in <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> for instance. Or maybe you made a JavaScript application in one of the popular frameworks <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>… etc. It may be a simple side-project or just an app for learning, but it always
comes to the problem where to host it, which provider to use, and which
provider offers most features for free so you can show to everybody your work.</p>
<p>Well, it’s 2020 and it has never been easier to host your static website for
free. Each one differs in some way but essentially they all offer the same
service, so we created a list of 18 free hosting providers that you might
consider for your current or next project.</p>
<p>Are you using some of these providers? Let us know in the comments on your
experience with them.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon AWS</a> is probably one of the most known hosting providers on the internet,
even if you don’t choose AWS, chances are you’ll end up on AWS since many of
the providers below are built on top of them. So instead you may consider
hosting your website directly on AWS.</p>
<p>AWS is completely free for the first year of use, after that, you get charged
for what you use.</p>

<p>Org 9.4 is out.  <a href="https://orgmode.org/Changes.html" title="Enjoy">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<p>Most of the time, when you hear that a free software project is
struggling, it is too late.  E.g. both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ip17pu/looking_for_a_maintainer_for_pdftoolstablist/" title="pdf-tools">pdf-tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2386" title="helm">helm</a> don't have a
maintainer since a few days: did you see this coming?</p>

<p>Org is doing quite well, but I feel we are at a turning point: either
we attract more contributors and we can afford to fix more bugs and
deliver new releases, or we might get overwhelmed by user requests and
lose both our energy and our motivation to continue.</p>

<p>Of course, part of this problem is my limited free time over the past
few years: don't worry, I am no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" title="BDFL">BDFL</a> and I will soon step down as the
maintainer.  Also, other core contributors have been more active than
I was able to be, so I guess my feeling is still valid, even for when
I won't be contributing anymore.</p>

<p>I think it boils down to this: we are not very good at <strong>helping you
help us</strong>.  So, here is my modest attempt at getting better at this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <strong>you are a power user</strong> but no Elisp hacker, can you <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">subscribe to</a></li><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">
  the mailing list</a> and help answering questions and reproducing bug
  reports?  I cannot insist enough on this: it really helps <em>a lot</em>.
</ul>

<p>Of course, you are also welcome to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web-social.html" title="help people on Stackoverflow and
  on Reddit">help people on Stackoverflow and

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-397" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><h3>Day 1: Finally, an easy one</h3><p>Got a pretty simple task for a change – read a new type of event stream generated by sales, and publish it to the data lake. Sounds like a straightforward ETL. I estimate this as one day of work. I can reuse a bunch of code from similar jobs and maybe finish even earlier.</p><p>This input data is being spilled from Kafka to S3, as Parquet files, which is nice, but oh boy – they decided to include every possible bit of information here – 350 different columns.</p><p>I need to understand both the schema and the properties – volume, column ranges, possible values and their meaning, and decide which fields I want to extract from this.</p><p>I also need to understand the SLA for this source – how often does it update? How much could it delay?&nbsp; Is it only ever appended to – or will history change?</p><p>Another important aspect – how does it relate to other data in the org? Can I join it using the columns I have? Do I need a lookup table? Does a “user_id” mean the same thing here as it does in other collections in the organization?</p><h3>Day 2: Let’s write a Spark Job</h3><p>Once I have all these sorted out, it’s time to do something useful with this data. Let’s start by aggregating it, pruning out the uninteresting columns, and partitioning it by date. Not sure which of the six columns that look like a date I should be using.&nbsp;</p><p>Guess I’ll need to sit down with the collection team a third time.</p><p>Now that I know what transformation I want to write, I remembered I have a Spark job that does something similar – I’ll modify it for this collection.&nbsp;</p><p>Spark is so expressive – it’s only 6 lines of code!</p><p>Well, 6 lines of business logic surrounded by 120 lines of wiring and boilerplate. Still nice though.</p><h3>Days 3-5: From sample data to real, somewhat big data</h3><p>So running on a small sample looks ok, lets run it on all of yesterday’s events!</p><p>Spark basically died. I’ll now spend the next day digging through logs: Spark executors, driver, yarn, stdout and stderr. Found a weird JVM error – <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> says I need to add some property to an xml file. Not sure I understand which one – all examples I found are for much older Hadoop versions. After 2 days of brute-forcing this setting into all possible XML files, I managed to complete successfully!</p><h3>Days 6-11: Let’s write a table</h3><p>So now, I need to think about how my output will be consumed: how often do I run it? Where do I keep its metadata? Do I provide an SLA? What guarantees do I give about the quality and validity of this dataset? Also, how do I keep it in sync with other related data? How long do I retain it for?</p><h3>Days 12-17: Going to Production</h3><p>Ok, so now we can deploy this to production!</p><p>I will write an Airflow DAG to orchestrate a daily job. When should it start? How do I know a full day is available for processing?</p><p>I’ll wait long enough and assume it’ll be fine. DAG deployed, scheduled for 3AM daily.</p><p>Maybe I’ll try to spin up a dedicated cluster on EMR?&nbsp;</p><p>4 days and 7 Zoom meetings later, I have pretty clear requirements. I think.</p><p>Last time I tried that, we ran out of IP addresses in the subnet. A time before that we hit the quota for the instance type I chose, so it couldn’t start running.</p><p>Let’s try just running it at 3:17 instead..? 🤷‍♂️</p><p>Next morning I see that our new collection is live! Airflow is green! Task is DONE.</p><p>Took only 6 lines of code, 17 Zoom meetings and 3 weeks to complete 🤦‍♀️</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png" alt="Diary of a Data Engineer" width="597" height="336" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-48x27.png 48w"><figcaption>Diary of a Data Engineer</figcaption></figure><h3>Day 21: Oh no, I forgot about monitoring.</h3><p>A few days later – i’m thinking, maybe it’d be a good idea to do a quick count(*) from Athena to make sure it still looks ok.</p><p>Damn. Yesterday’s partition is only about 10% the size of previous days. I better reply-all on my go-live email and tell everyone. Not even sure who else is using this. Seems like it’s gonna be one of THOSE days again…</p><p>Coming in the next day, I see my simple Spark job has been running for 8 hours already, barely making any progress. Apparently using a shared Spark cluster wasn’t the best idea – there are 12 other jobs scheduled to start at 3AM as well. Guess everyone else also thought 3 hours after midnight was a safe bet for daily data.</p><h5><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ozkatz100">Oz Katz</a> is the co-creator of <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/">lakeFS</a>, an open source platform that delivers resilience and manageability to object-storage based data lakes.

<p><em>Do you know why social media sites are so addictive? Yeah, sure, let’s cover the basics: they’re flooded with funny memes and short-form videos that play themselves when you scroll, all of your friends are on social media, and besides, where else to nag about your recent Uber experience? But there is something else entirely that’s keeping you inside Facebook and Twitter like a crackhead inside a drugstore – immediate feedback. Sadly, this same thing, is also the reason you abandon your <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/long-term-thinking/">long-term projects</a>.</em></p>



<p>A lot of times writing, to me, feels like sitting alone and talking to myself. I write stuff, I publish them, and nothing really happens. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The lack of feedback</a> – good or bad – makes me doubt the work I do. It immediately instills negative thoughts that whisper in my head, “Go do something else, you suck at writing. You see? No one is noticing.”</p>



<p>The same is with any other form of venture if you’re just starting. You open an online shop, you carefully arrange your categories, you sit, and you wait. Unless you market the shit out of your brand new site, no one will notice what you did – except probably your mom. If you want to make sales, you need to basically purchase your own stuff in the beginning.</p>



<p>But this is not limited to business, this same principle applies if you want to lose weight, learn a new language, a new skill, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/">adopt a new habit</a>, and anything else that can potentially make you a better human being.</p>



<p>“Good things take time,” others say. But being patient in the world of reactions without delay is hard. It takes true heroism to keep working on a project for years until you finally <em>make it</em>.</p>



<p>The lack of immediate feedback, or any form of feedback for that matter, can crush your enthusiasm and get you back to the drawing board. That’s why social media platforms feel so good and so many people sit inside. You publish something, and you immediately get some sort of response or reaction. Yes, you can only get a few likes but it surely feels a lot better than writing for years till someone notices, or restlessly sweating in the gym till you finally <em>get </em>that shred body.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there is a way to overcome the devastating thoughts that consume your mind when there’s no response from users and keep working on your business idea. You just need to shift your perspective and use the three-year rule.</p>







<h2><strong>What’s The Three Year Rule</strong>?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, we expect things to happen overnight. We have same-day deliveries, instant messaging, a quick way to buy things online, leave a review, get a refund, and above all we see people who worked as bank clerks, as if it were yesterday, but today, these same people run a multi-million dollar business.</p>



<p>Media outlets emphasis only on the last part of creating a project – the part where people are now successful. They don’t talk enough about the long hours, the doubt, all the hard work. They try to sell you the idea that you, too, can make it big. And I’m not saying that you can’t, but it will surely take a lot more time than what the online gurus are telling you.</p>



<p>That’s where the three year rule comes in.</p>



<p>There’s nothing fancy about this command. It will simply give you a different perspective when you want to make a project successful or make some positive changes in your life.</p>



<p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p>


<div id="ub_click_to_tweet_d948d44f-7576-4384-80fc-c740963b536a"><p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p></div>






<h2>Why The Three Year Rule is Important?</h2>



<p>Ask any successful person. Ask any experienced person. They’ll all tell you the same thing – It takes time to create something valuable. Something worth doing.</p>



<p>Yet, we’re not able to accept this narrative. We want things to happen right now because everything around us is moving so fast. </p>



<p>When we begin working on a project, start learning something new, when we open our online store, we want to see results. We want to see some sort of progress because progress means that what we’re doing is working. That our efforts are not in vain. </p>



<p>Of course, things don’t work like that. Reality is different from our expectations. Progress is slow, sales are stagnant, people are not commenting on our new blog post… When these things happen, naturally, we start to lose faith in what we’re doing and we abandoned things.</p>



<p>But the problem is not that our work suck – at least this is not the main issue – or because we’re not doing the right things, it’s simply because we’re entering the project with the wrong expectations. We expect things to happen fast, and when they don’t – which is normal – we blame the market, our customers, our spouse, and we close shop.</p>

They expect quick results and when reality does not meet their expectations, they give up.</figcaption></figure>







<p>But things can be way different if we reframe our expectations. If we enter this project, any project, with reasonable expectations. </p>



<p>Instead of hoping for overnight success, we need to accept reality. To tell our instant-feedback-craving minds that it takes time to create something lasting. </p>

<p>Right from the start, set the right expectations. Don’t aim to succeed this month, neither this year, plan to succeed after 3 years.</p>







<h2>How To Apply The Three Year Rule?</h2>



<p>Commit to doing something for 3 years. 5 years. Even 20 years.</p>



<p>The number of years is not that important – of course, it should be at least a couple of years so you can make some real progress. The most important thing is to set the right expectations right from the start. To convince your mind that it will take time to see results.</p>



<p>Here are some actionable steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> Start with what you want to do and why you want to do it. Opening an online shop surely feels exciting but if your main ambition is to make money, and nothing else, you won’t last long. You need a strong motive. Something that will inspire you to wake up every day at 5 in the morning. Something that will motivate you to <a aria-label="keep you going despite the obstacles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep you going despite the obstacles</a>.<span id="easy-footnote-1-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-8884" title="Read <a href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/start-with-why/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Start with Why (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Start with Why</a> by Simon Sinek for more actionable strategies on this."><sup>1</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Commit:</strong> Allow yourself at least 3 years to do the above. Good things take time. There’s no such thing as an overnight success. The stories we read online are showing us only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the water, there’s always years of hard work. If you’re not willing to commit at least 3 years to a project, save yourself some time and money and don’t start at all.</li><li><strong> Say no:</strong> Once you know what you’re going to do, say no to things unrelated to your main goal. Say no to other opportunities. Say no to emerging business trends. And be firm when you say it. This step is crucial. If you stay open for opportunities you won’t make any progress. Close all windows of opportunity and stay committed to your long term goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Don’t blindly follow the path you originally set. It’s normal for our mission to be flawed at first. After all, we didn’t have any experience in the field initially. When we actually start working on the project, we’ll know better. So, after a couple of months, when we see the flaws in our original idea, once we know what’s not working, and what’s not going to work, make the correct adjustments and move forward.</li></ul>



<p>These are the basics.</p>



<p>For reference, and inspiration, let me share how things look for me at <a href="https://durmonski.com/">durmonski.com</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> I see more and more people obsessing about trivial stuff – cheap clothes, gadgets, video games, famous people with no real values, the latest trends, etc. Sadly, The more we consume this type of hollow content, the more ambitionless we became. We settle for Netflix and chill, and we don’t have any desire to make something lasting. I want to even things out. I want to be a source of quality content that can help more people realize that they can do so much more with their time. My drive since the beginning of this site is to create thought-provoking content that will inspire and help folks become more rational.</li><li><strong>Commitment:</strong> I started in 2018 and my original commitment was to work on the site for 3 years. It’s been 2 years, but progress is slower than I thought. And while I often feel down about the lack of big results, my original commitment changed to 5 years. Why keep doing it since results are low? Because I can see myself doing this type of work for at least another 10 or 20 years. I love it and I often receive praise from readers. With this in mind, I’m fine with waiting for 2-3 more years to see results.<span id="easy-footnote-2-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-8884" title="I say that the progress is slow because I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of visitors to my site. Hence, a lot of <a aria-label=&quot;members (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/membership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>members</a>. Getting a lot of traffic usually happens when you have a lot of sites linking back to your site. And this process, unfortunately, takes time."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Say no: </strong>Every now and then, I have an idea for a new project. A concept for a new site that seems way better than what I’m currently doing. But instead of going forward with the new ideas, I write them down. In most cases, after just a few days, I realize that this new concept is not going to work and I feel even more inspired to work on my main goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> When I first started this site, I was publishing mainly articles about <a aria-label="how to become a minimalist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/the-remedy-for-modern-busyness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to become a minimalist</a>, how to travel with less, all the minimal stuff. I did it because it was trendy back then. My goal was still the same back then – help people get out of the consumerist mindset. However, after a couple of months, I realized that I want to write about slightly different things. Put simply, I was trying to be someone I’m not initially. So, I’ve made some adjustments. The main mission didn’t change much but my daily actions did. The content I publish now represents truly who I am.</li></ul>







<div id=""><div><div><div><div><p><strong>Diversion</strong>: Regardless of our efforts and our desire to make things work, sometimes, our idea is simply not that good.

<p>There isn't a great pullquote here, because the whole thing is ridiculous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While out at a nearby cafe in smoke-engulfed Vancouver, I noticed that the screen on my partner's 2015 13" MacBook Pro had experienced some delamination. She's also been complaining about her battery life, and since the computer had just run out of that, and since I had the same screen problem resolved under their repair program, I decided to start up a chat with Apple Support to see if they could assist us.</p>
<p>To be clear, the vast majority of my experiences with Apple Support have been pretty good. Sometimes it takes a little bit of work, but I've generally ended up better off than before with few exceptions. This was the single most dissapointing interaction I've had with any tech support rep as far as I can recall. The numbers Joe suggested in this conversation are either entirely fabricated, or belong to the cost of replacing the entire machine if its experienced catastrophic damage. But, after clarifying numerous times about what the numbers actually represent and comparing to previous repair bills for the same issue, my belief is that the rep used a false and obscured repair order to persuade me to replace my girlfriend's minimally damaged screen with a new computer.</p>
<p>I'm sorry ahead of time for the entire transcript taking the form of a number of screenshots, but after trying to wrangle Acrobat Pro for far too long in order to redact the sensitive information, I just took the shortest path.</p>
<p>Also, after re-reading, I did make some minor grammatical errors and typos, particularly when asking for clarification on the cost of the 2019 MBP screen repair. This should be the $2051.84 from the post screenshot.</p>
<p>All dollar amounts are in <strong>CAD</strong></p>

Here it is below, for both my 2019 MBP 13" and the 2015 model that spurred the conversation. My main issue here, is that it's just a number and a payment request, there isn't any way to confirm the very confident claims made by the support rep. Is it really just a top case replacement? Probably not, considering previous top case replacements have only run between $500 and $1000.</p><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png 1062w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 691w"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-3.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>But what's it for!?</figcaption></figure><p>Here also is a copy of a previous repair bill, this time for a logic board and display assembly replacement under warranty.

                    <p>What this article is about, what I assume you to know, how the article is structured and how it is to be used.</p>
                    <div id="section_intro">
                      <p>The Conjugate Gradient method is one of the most important ideas in scientific computing: It is applied for solving large sparse linear equations, like those arising in the numerical solution of partial differential equations 
                        and it is also used as a powerful optimization method.

                      <p>This article is trying to give an intuitive introduction to the <span>Conjugate Gradient method.<span>from now on often abbreviated as "CG"</span></span></p>
                      <p>The CG method is based on a beautiful geometric idea but this idea is barely explained in most exposition texts, a fact that was lamented (and alleviated) by Jonathan Shewchuk's grandiose paper "An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain". 
                        This article tries to transfer Shewchuk's brilliant explanations into a more interactive medium. 
                      </p>
                      <p>Note that this article is designed to be read on a decently sized monitor. While a phone screen will show the necessary info, there are some features and visualizations that might not work satisfactorily.</p>
                      <p>If you find errors, have comments on the mathematical and/or didactical exposition, please drop me an email at contact@pwacker.com.</p>
                      <p>I assume you need this algorithm for one of the following use-cases:
                        </p><ol>
                          <li>Solving a linear system of equations \[A x = b\]for a matrix \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) 
                            symmetric and positive definite and vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\). This setting typically arises when you need to solve partial differential equations numerically.</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a quadratic function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c\] with a matrix 
                            \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) symmetric and positive definite, vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\) 
                            and a scalar \(c\in \mathbb R\)</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a more complicated function \[f : \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R.\]</li>
                        </ol>
                          <p>The first two cases are equivalent (<span><i onclick="clickMinimizeUnminimize(['equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'], this, event)" onmouseout="unhighlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'), col='lavender')" onmouseover="highlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'))"></i> </span>).</p>
                          <p>
                            Note that the quadratic function is differentiable and has gradient \(\nabla f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(A^T + A)x - b = Ax - b\) (last step by symmetry of \(A\)) and (by positive definiteness of \(A\)) 
                            is guaranteed to have exactly one minimum which needs to fulfill \(\nabla f(x) = 0\). Hence, minimization of \(f\) amounts exactly to solving the linear equation \(Ax = b\).
                          </p>
                          <p>Although CG was developed for minimization of quadratic functions, it is
                            applied to non-quadratic minimization problems as well.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Obviously, the solution to \(Ax = b\) is \(x = A^{-1}b\) but we assume that the dimension \(n\) of the problem 
                            is so high that we cannot invert the matrix. From here on, we won't allow matrix inversion as a feasible operation. We even forbid 
                            explicitly solving linear equations of the form \(Ax = b\). This is not the same as inverting \(A\) and multiplying \(A^{-1}b\) and is a lot 
                            faster than that, but we assume that the problem is so big that even this will not work.
                            We allow, on the other hand, all kinds of (valid) multiplications between vectors and matrices and assume that those can be 
                            done efficiently.
                          </p>
                          <p>Because the CG method is most intuitively understood in the context of optimization, we will drop the \(Ax = b\) aspect for now and 
                            we will mostly look at the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of the form \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c.\]
                            We also make the standing assumption that \(A\) is square, symmetric and positive definite. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Because we assume that exact solution of the minimization problem (or equivalently, solving the corresponding linear equation) cannot be done efficiently, 
                            we will look at <emph>iterative methods</emph>, i.e. we will construct an iteration \(x_{i}\mapsto x_{i+1}\) such that the sequence 
                            \[ x_0, x_1,x_2,\ldots\] converges to the minimum.
                          </p>

                        <p>We are going to discuss iterative optimization methods, i.e. we will construct
                          a sequence \[x_0, x_1, x_2,\ldots\] such that

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-13-bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/cover.png" alt="illustration">
Back in spring 2020 at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
we were looking to replace our <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>-<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
duo by a more lightweight framework to power our future Kotlin microservices.
We did some detailed (at times philosophical) theoretical comparisons that I much enjoyed,
but these cannot substitute a hands-on experience.
We decided to implement proof-of-concept microservices using the most viable frameworks,
stressing them in a benchmark along the way.
While <strong>Kotlin</strong> was the main language,
I saw this as an opportunity to have some fun at home and test (my proficiency with) <strong>Rust</strong>,
which is touted for being fast.
I ended up stress-testing Kotlinâ€™s <a href="https://www.http4k.org/"><strong>Http4k</strong></a>, <a href="https://ktor.io/"><strong>Ktor</strong></a>,
and Rustâ€™s <a href="https://actix.rs/"><strong>Actix</strong> Web</a>, read on to see how they fared.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <a href="#the-results">jump to the results</a> and read the background later, if youâ€™re impatient.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">On TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Why not just refer to excellent <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">TechEmpower Benchmarks (TEB)</a>?</p>

<p>A very valid question to ask. A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submitted TEB implementations tend to be rather optimised.
We wanted to measure such a code style that we would normally write:
one striving to be simple/idiomatic/readable,
but finished promptly and not extensively profiled.
On the other hand, we wanted to include production-grade API error handling
(correct HTTP codes and JSON error messages listing problems of individual parameters etc.),
request logging, and OpenAPI (Swagger) spec generation.</li>
  <li>Besides high-water req/s performance and associated latencies,
we wanted to capture more operational characteristics like memory usage, CPU usage and efficiency,
along the lifetime of a microservice instance.</li>
  <li>In production, we run our microservices in a rather high-density Kubernetes cluster,
where every instance has to be CPU- and memory-constrained.
We wanted to simulate this environment
and check whether we can use trending â€œserverlessâ€� offerings for new services.</li>
  <li>Our data store, Elasticsearch, differs from ones included in TEB,
and we were curious how synchronous vs. asynchronous flavours of the Elasticsearch client compare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-service">The Service</h2>

<p>For a description of the service to implement &amp; benchmark,
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/api-spec.md">see its API Spec document available in the locations-rs repository</a>.</p>

<p>We benchmark its simplest <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint,
whose work is to look up a <code>city</code> document by id in Elasticsearch,
look up associated <code>region</code> document,
and render response JSON.
It uses internal in-memory cache for regions (there is just tens of them),
but no cache for much more numerous cities.</p>

<p>To reduce bandwidth when fetching documents from Elasticsearch,
all implementations instruct it to strip (at least) the largest property <code>geometry</code>.
This property is only used in Elasticsearch-side filtering, not by the microservice.
I believe the stripping significantly strains Elasticsearch
(or rather transfers the strain from the microservice to it).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark">The Benchmark</h2>

<h3 id="recipe">Recipe</h3>

<p>The benchmark consists of multiple identical â€œrunsâ€� for each Dockerised implementation spawned
by <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/bench-3-impls.py">bench-3-impls.py</a>.
The runs are named after the implementation and their ordinal number,
thus <code>rs-actix-1</code> is the first run of the Rust (Actix) implementation,
and <code>kt-ktor-3</code> is the third run of Kotlin (Ktor) implementation.</p>

<p>Each run simulates the first couple of minutes of the microservice instance using <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/test-image.py">test-image.py</a>.
Steps of one run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Docker container is started, measuring the time until the service starts responding,</li>
  <li>a suite of HTTP checks is made ensuring correct responses and error handling behaviour,</li>
  <li>HTTP load is generated using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>
in a series of 10-second long steps with increasing concurrent connection count;
the metrics are collected from <code>wrk</code> and Docker API after each step:
    <ul>
      <li>first 5 steps use just one concurrent connection, acting as a warm-up,</li>
      <li>each of the next 11 steps doubles concurrent connection count, i.e. continuing with 2, 4,
8, â€¦, 1024, 2048.<sup id="fnref:conn-count" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conn-count">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all runs are plotted using the awesome <a href="http://www.pygal.org/">Pygal</a> library
in <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/render-tests.py">render-tests.py</a>.
Different runs of a single implementation use the same colour,
allowing for visual inspection of the variance between them.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Docker is told to constrain resources available to the microservice containers,
a practice usual in typical Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>The CPU is limited to 1.5 CPU-units using an equivalent of the <code>--cpus=1.5</code> Docker option.
This means that even though the instance has access to all 4 CPU cores of the machine,
it can use only 15 CPU-seconds (out of theoretical 40 CPU-seconds) in each 10-wall-clock-second step.
The value of 1.5 was chosen small enough to ensure the tested microservice is the actual bottle-neck during the benchmark,
and large enough to assert frameworks make proper use of multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>Memory is limited to 512 MiB. I argue that anything beyond 512 MiB should not be called a <em>micro</em>service.</p>

<p>The two JVM-hosted Kotlin implementations run in OpenJDK 11,
with <code>-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75</code> as the sole option.
It should allow JVM to allocate up to 75% of available 512 MiB memory to Java heap.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>The benchmarks run on 2 Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine
located in the same zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st VM, <code>n2d-highcpu-4</code> machine type (4 AMD Epyc <em>Rome</em> vCPUs, 4 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the benchmarked microservice in a Docker container <em>and</em> the <code>wrk</code> load generator.</li>
      <li>As the container is limited to 1.5 CPU and <code>wrk</code> takes less than leftover 2.5 CPUs,
they should not affect each other.</li>
      <li>Indeed, the maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 70%.</li>
      <li>The N2D <a href="https://www.quortex.io/post/an-open-source-framework-to-benchmark-cloud-providers-performances-for-live-streaming">machine type is said to have the best performance/cost ratio on GCP and even across cloud providers</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2nd VM, <code>e2-custom</code> machine type
(12 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/understanding-dynamic-resource-management-in-e2-vms">high-density vCPUs</a>, 6 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs a stock Dockerised Elasticsearch 7.8.0 instance, storage backend for the microservices.</li>
      <li>Maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 80% â€”
I have scaled the number of Elasticsearch CPU cores up until it ceased to be a bottleneck, arriving at 12.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-contenders">The Contenders</h2>

<ol>
  <li><code>locations-kt-http4k</code>: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tree/kt-http4k">code on GitLab</a>

      <li>programming model: classic <strong>synchronous</strong> (threads &amp; blocking I/O calls)</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We also initially implemented a Kotlin proof-of-concept in <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>,
but it turned out none of the team members was keen on the programming paradigm this framework suggested
(which may be a subjective matter), so we hadnâ€™t proceeded further with it.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-http4k">The Story of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code></h3>

<p>Http4k Locations service was written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>.
It became the production implementation at GoOut
and is thus most complete along with extras like Swagger serving.</p>

<p>Http4k <a href="https://www.http4k.org/guide/modules/servers/">allows one to select from several server backends</a>,
so we first need to do a qualification benchmark and select the best performing engine to be fair.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-server-engines-pub/bench-results.html"><strong>Kttp4k server engine results on a dedicated page</strong></a>.
Line labels on the graph correspond to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tags">tags in the locations-kt-http4k repository</a>.</p>

<p>One nice side-effect of this benchmarking was that
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141#issuecomment-679330954">discovered a cause</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141"><strong>Netty</strong> backend performance issue</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/pull/480">@<strong>daviddenton</strong> was quick to fix it</a>.
The <code>netty-updfix-*</code> graphs, which exhibit some nice latency characteristics, already contain the fix.
It was later released in http4k v3.259.0 (be sure to upgrade if you use this backend).</p>

<p><strong>Apache HttpCore</strong> version 4.4, labelled as <code>apache4-*</code>, was most CPU-efficient backend
and achieved shared first place in peak req/s performance.
However, it tends to draw too much memory as the number of concurrent connections grows,
and is out-of-memory-killed once their number reaches (extreme) 1024.
Apache HttpCore version 5.0 (<code>apache-*</code>) and a variant with lowered socket backlog (<code>apache-q100-*</code>)
suffer from the same problem.
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/481">opened an issue</a> to see if thatâ€™s a bug or not,
insights welcome.
Meanwhile, I would recommend different http4k backends for services not shielded by load balancers.</p>

<p>The winner of this qualification round is the <strong>Undertow</strong> backend
(<code>undertow-*</code> for v3.163.0 and <code>undertow-upd-*</code> for v3.258.0),
which shares the first place in high-water req/s performance,
but also brings good all-round results in the rest of the metrics,
especially memory consumption under load.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jetty</strong> backend (<code>jetty-*</code>) slightly but consistently lags behind other production engines
in most metrics.
For completeness, I have also included the <strong>SunHttp</strong> backend that is intended for development only,
which the benchmarks confirm.</p>

<p><em>Update: Http4k author <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/issues/1">has pointed out that OpenAPI generation through Contracts API may incur some performance penalty</a>.

<p>Ktor variant was also written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
I later tweaked the <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint for functional parity with other implementations.
It remains the least complete implementation with just this single endpoint.</p>

<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client">es-kotlin-wrapper-client</a> to wrap

<p>Ktor also allows for pluggable HTTP server engines which I benchmarked.
See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-ktor-server-engines/bench-results.html"><strong>Ktor server engine benchmarks page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is similar here with <strong>Netty</strong> being more efficient and performant than <strong>Jetty</strong>,
thus qualified as Ktorâ€™s engine of choice for the main benchmark.</p>

"We call it the silent killer," she&nbsp;told <a href="http://cbc.ca/day6"><em><u>Day 6</u></em></a><em> </em>host Brent Bambury.</p>  <p>According to a <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125937/">recent study out of Duke University</a></u>, heat-related illnesses are responsible for more than 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.</p>  <p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control, meanwhile, puts that number at approximately 600. Baughman-McLeod says the lower number is likely the result of underreporting given many health record-keeping systems don't allow for heat-related mortality and morbidity in most places.</p>  <p>"Part of the challenge is that we don't keep records of heat-related illness and death, and oftentimes you would show up to the emergency room with a heat illness and it would be categorized as a kidney failure or a heart attack," she said.</p>  <h2>Protecting the most vulnerable</h2>  <p>Several cities — including Athens, Tel Aviv and Melbourne — and international climate organizations have signed on in support of the alliance's naming goal.</p>  <p>Those living in cities are more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Cities are built from materials that trap heat and lead to a "heat island effect" that can increase temperatures by up to 8 C, sayid&nbsp;Baughman-McLeod.</p>    <p>She believes that naming heat waves could help create measures that protect those most vulnerable to the heat, including those living in cities without access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down.</p>  <p>"Farm workers and delivery workers and construction workers ...&nbsp;wouldn't be expected to work during a named heat wave where they are," she said as an example.</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Area residents capture video along the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as the city's skies are blanketed with smog and debris from wildfires throughout the state.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:45</span></span></span></p>  <p>With a name, she argued, news and social media could more easily elevate awareness of a heat wave.</p>  <p>But not everyone agrees on what is considered extreme heat, a challenge Baughman-McLeod is aware of.</p>  <p>She says that for this to work, an international framework must be created. From there, regions will be able to adapt what is considered extreme to their own climate.</p>  <p>"It will be about local conditions and the people who live in those areas there, what they're used to," she said.</p>  <p>When the U.S.-based Weather Channel began naming winter storms, there was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74744/why-it-controversial-name-winter-storms">disagreement</a> among meteorologists and scientists. While Baughman-McLeod acknowledges that it has presented some challenges, she believes her group is working to develop the best framework.</p>  <p>"We are in discussions with those groups of scientists and researchers, applied scientists, climatologists, heat-health scientists, social scientists," she told <em>Day 6.</em></p>  <p>"We will 100 per cent depend on science- and data-informed strategy to get to heat wave naming."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Jason Vermes&nbsp;with files from The Associated Press.

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/mexican_calendar_systems.jpg" alt="Confusing Mexican Calendar, at least for those not in the know" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Freetype, included in the <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">font stack on
Unix</a>, is quite
complex. There are so many layers to get it to do what it does that
it’s easy to get lost. From finding the font, to actually rendering it,
and everything in between.<br>
Like most of the world, I use a rather low screens definition
(1366x768 with 96 dpi) and rather old-ish laptop, unlike some <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/">font
designers that live in a filter bubble where everyone has the latest
macbook</a>. Thus, good and legible font
rendering is important.<br>
Let’s play with lesser known toggles available to us when it comes to font
rendering and see what they do, let’s have fun and explore possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="a-general-picture">A General Picture</h2>

<p>Generally, to make a font look better on screens, which are arrays of
pixels, we use a combination of these three:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Antialiasing</strong>: Applying a light shade around the glyph. It is useful
at small scale, when you don’t have enough pixels, but it makes most
glyphs look bolder.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_antialias.jpg" alt="Font anti-alias example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subpixel rendering</strong>: A technique similar to antialias but using
subpixels, the color components inside the pixels. By applying a
small amount of colors on the sides you can reach more granular
precision. However, if applied clumsily, or if you simply move the
window containing the text, these colored subpixels will become
apparent, what we call fringe.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_subpixel_rendering.jpg" alt="Font sub-pixel rendering example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hinting</strong>: Pixels are blocks but text is made of curves, that means
these curves will never match exactly with screen pixels. Hinting
is about repositioning or selecting the closest pixels while trying
as much as possible to keep the shape of the glyph intact. There are
multiple levels of hinting, hinting information provided by the font
itself (bytecode interpreter hinting), and hinting provided by the
rendering library (auto-hinting).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_hinting.jpg" alt="Font hinting example" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>NB</em>: “It’s just text”… This article is yet another that
shows how fonts aren’t as easy as they look.  For more info
about the font stack, please visit <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">my previous article on the
topic</a>, and if you
want an idea of what it means to draw them on the screen take a look a
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/09/02/fonts-xcb.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>What is applied, when, how to control all of this, can we see what they
do, and should we even care?</p>

<p>Freetype and fontconfig default rendering these days is pretty good,
so there shouldn’t be anything to worry about; Until there’s something
to worry about, like a font not looking the way you want.<br>
Our first stop will be something that intrigued me because I haven’t
heard many talk about it: the Freetype driver’s properties.<br>
The Freetype driver is used whenever hinting is needed, so this is the
part it actually changes — how hinting is applied.</p>



<p>Let’s start with arming ourselves with ways to easily test all this.<br>
Freetype2 demos utilities are a must, you can clone them
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/09/14/git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2-demos.git">here</a>
or fetch them from your package repositiory, for example
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/freetype2-demos">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2-demos/">Arch
Linux</a>.<br>
These will give you a bunch of useful tools such as <code>ftdiff</code>, <code>ftview</code>,
<code>ftstring</code> <code>ftgrid</code>, <code>fttimer</code>, <code>ftbench</code>, and others. The most important
ones for us are <code>ftdiff</code> and <code>ftgrid</code>.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 20 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftstring <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-m</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, you can install <code>pango-view</code> from <code>pango-tools</code>
to later test if fontconfig applies your configurations
properly. It can be used by preparing a file written in <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html">pango
markup</a>
and displaying it using <code>pango-view --markup file.pangpang</code>.<br>
You can set the fontconfig debug level higher to see which font is
actually loaded by setting the <code>FC_DEBUG</code> to something like 4096,
<code>FC_DEBUG=4096</code>.</p>

<p>More values can be found here, we’ll use them later to see if our
fontconfig settings are applied properly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="man">Name         Value    Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------
MATCH            1    Brief information about font matching
MATCHV           2    Extensive font matching information
EDIT             4    Monitor match/test/edit execution
FONTSET          8    Track loading of font information at startup
CACHE           16    Watch cache files being written
CACHEV          32    Extensive cache file writing information
PARSE           64    (no longer in use)
SCAN           128    Watch font files being scanned to build caches
SCANV          256    Verbose font file scanning information
MEMORY         512    Monitor fontconfig memory usage
CONFIG        1024    Monitor which config files are loaded
LANGSET       2048    Dump char sets used to construct lang values
MATCH2        4096    Display font-matching transformation in patterns</code></pre></figure>

<p>Yet another way is to test directly in your browser URL bar:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml">data:text/html,<span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf8"</span><span>&gt;&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"font-family: Times New Roman;"</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-freetype2-drivers-properties">The Freetype2 Drivers Properties</h2>

<p>So let’s get back to our testing of Freetype2 drivers.<br>
On <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-properties.html">this documentation
page</a>,
ft (freetype) properties are listed and are said to affect the behavior
of the drivers, each touching a different one. They are set by modifying
the <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment variable, normally loaded from
<code>/etc/profile.d/freetype2.sh</code>.<br>
However, most of the ones listed are targeted at the CFF, Type 1,
and CID fonts driver and not at TrueType fonts, so they do nothing
if you don’t have these font types. The only toggle <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-tt_driver.html">available for
TrueType</a>
is the <code>interpreter-version</code> which controls the bytecode interpreter,
the rasterizer, and thus how the outline gets hinted.</p>

<p>The options available to us are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 — For classic mode GDI (Win 98/2000)</li>
  <li>38 — GDI+ old (Vista, Win 7), Infinality, considered slow</li>
  <li>40 — For minimal mode (stripped down Infinality, this is the default)
(After Win 7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of weird that we jump from 35 to 38, where did 36 and the rest go? The
answer is that it’s a choice from the Freetype devs to only include those
and not the ones in between.</p>

<p>And the differences look as follows, notice the native hinter in the
left column:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v35.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=38"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v38.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v40</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=40"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=40"</span> ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 36 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v40.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We can also test using <code>pango-view</code> (remember again that this should be a font
that has native hinting enabled but not the auto-hinter):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;span</span> <span>font_family=</span><span>"Times New Roman"</span> <span>font=</span><span>"10"</span> <span>foreground=</span><span>"black"</span> <span>alpha=</span><span>"83%"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also change the font via the <code>--font=</code> argument of <code>pango-view</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> pango-view <span>--markup</span> text.bangarang</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v35.png" alt="pango interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v38.png" alt="pango interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v40</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v40.png" alt="pango interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>So definitely, older interpreter versions were rougher with hinting, much
bolder, and could deform the glyphs. The newer ones are more minimal with
it. We also notice that the auto-hinter isn’t that bad and that avoiding
hinting can help. I took the specific case of the Windows font ‘Times New
Roman’ because it has the reputation of rendering badly with Freetype,
mostly because of the job the interpreter does. Applying very light or no
hinting at all helps tremendously, even at very small point size as you
can see in the next comparison. The hinting does indeed help legibility
at this scale but the font shape and personality is completely destroyed.</p>

<p>From left to right: v35, v38, v40.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_small_point.png" alt="pang interpreter small point comparison" loading="lazy"></p>

<h2 id="how-fontconfig-works">How Fontconfig Works</h2>

<p>We’re not done with hinting yet, there can be many levels of hinting
that can be applied, but let’s first take a detour and learn a bit about
fontconfig and how to use it.</p>

<p>Fontconfig is the layer in the font stack responsible for loading the
font along with the configurations that tell the next layer how to find
the font file and what changes to apply when rendering it. It is usually
composed of a library, a preset of configuration files, and a bunch
of helpful tools all starting with the prefix <code>fc-</code> such as: <code>fc-cache</code>,
<code>fc-query</code>, <code>fc-match</code>, and <code>fc-conflist</code>, to name a few.</p>

<p>The configuration files are usually found in <code>/etc/fonts/</code> and split into
the presets available <code>/etc/fonts/conf.avail</code>, and the chosen presets in
<code>/etc/fonts/conf.d</code>, which are symbolic links to the former.<br>
The precedence of the rules is alphanumerical, a first-come
first-served principle, thus <code>01-custom-rule.conf</code> will be loaded
before <code>99-not-important-rule.conf</code>. Local user configurations, in
the user’s <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig</code> directory, are loaded from
one of these configurations that contains an include statement. On
my machine it is the <code>50-user.conf</code>, so it’s precedence is lower
than anything loaded before it. This isn’t practical when testing
rules so rename this file to something like <code>01-user.conf</code>. Now
anything you put in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d</code> or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> should have priority.<br>
You can make sure the order and configurations are loaded properly by
using the <code>fc-conflist</code> command. It lists in order of precedence the
configurations found, the ones starting with a <code>+</code> are loaded, the ones
with <code>-</code> are not.</p>

<p>These files are composed of mainly 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match rules: If something matches, then edit the properties
mentioned. There are ton of matching and editing rules, even including
stuff like the program name that is currently trying to load …</li></ul></article></div></div>

</header><p>
I was mystified when I first came across the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">“Most Inflationary”</a> winning
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/">entry</a> in the 2018 <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.  Written by the <a href="https://bellard.org/">incredibly prolific</a> Fabrice
Bellard, this tiny program with just 4KB of source code emitted a
128×128 resolution version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#Criticism">(in)famous</a> Lena test image.  Voodoo!
The IOCCC judges wrote “We could understand some of the arithmetic but none
of the magic.”  I was determined to figure out the magic and inspired by
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard</a> to try to write up how it works.
</p>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward enough, and both the source and the
details of running it can be found on its IOCCC page.  I used GCC to
compile it and piped the output directly to ImageMagick to view it:
</p>

<div>
<pre>gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
./prog | display -                        # Show embedded image
./prog d &lt; vintage_cars.bin | display -   # Show an external image
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running it with no arguments like the first case will decompress the
embedded data and produce the following image (zoomed for detail):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/image.png" alt="image.png">

</figure>

<p>
Admittedly, this has a fair number of compression artifacts, but it’s still
pretty darned impressive for 2439 bytes of image data and 1544 bytes of
source code for the decompressor.
</p>

<p>
So let’s see how it works.  This will be a deep dive and by far my longest
post yet (I’ve erred on the side of too much detail), so make
yourself comfortable!  From here on in, I’m going to show the pieces of the
original program juxtaposed with the corresponding pieces from my
deobfuscated version.  When I mention line numbers, I’ll be referring to
the later unless noted otherwise.  I’ll typically use italicized numbers in
parenthesis to denote these.
</p>

<p>
For my version I have expanded the lone macro (used to compact <code>for</code>
loops), reformated the source, and renamed the variables.  The only
structural changes that I have made are from updating to modern style
function headers and pushing declarations down to be as local in scope as
possible (C99 style).  In one case, I gave a variable different names when
pushing it down into two blocks where it had been reused in different ways.

We’ll start at the end of the program with the <code>main()</code> function and then
work our way backwards to the beginning; we’ll essentially go from top to
bottom in terms of control flow.  Here’s the <code>main()</code> function:

<span>250: </span>}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The image is basically encoded in two distinct layers.  The lower level
uses a lossless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoding</a> scheme that stores only single bits and
unsigned integers.  We’ll see this in detail later.  For now, it’s enough
to know that the first line (<i>230</i>) checks for an argument to determine
whether to expect the image on standard input or to decompress the image
from an internal string.  The data is stored slightly differently in the
two modes and the related value here doubles as a flag.  The second line
(<i>231</i>) then primes the pump for the decoding this bitstream.  (However,
this turns out to be superfluous as it would have been called later
anyway.)
</p>

<p>
At the higher level, the first thing to be decoded (<i>232–236</i>) is a small
header comprised of four integers.  The first of these stores the image
width as a power of two.  Due to a fixed-size array used to store the
decompressed image, the width is limited to 1024.  The second integer
stores how many lines shorter the image height is compared to the width.
This will be zero for square images but means that only square or landscape
oriented images are possible.  The next two lines decode a pair of
parameters related to the image quality.  Higher numbers here give greater
compression at the expense of image quality.  The lowest legal values for
each are 1 and should produce near lossless results.  For the built-in Lena
image, the four values in this header are 7, 0, 41, and 82, respectively.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4f12528">
<h2 id="org4f12528">PPM Output</h2>
<div id="text-org4f12528">
<p>
The decoded image is written to standard output in the form of a PPM file.
This is a <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">wonderfully simple format</a> for writing that consist of a small
header indicating the image type, resolution, and maximum color value.  A
single <code>printf()</code> suffices for this (<i>238</i>).  Following this, the image
data itself is simply a series of unsigned bytes in interleaved RGB order
for each pixel and the pixels in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
(<i>245–247</i>).  Because of the lossy format, the decompressed RGB values may
fall outside the 0 to 255 range, so a small helper function is used to
clamp and then write them:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>109: </span><span>K</span>(b){
<span>110: </span>putchar(b&lt;0?0:b&gt;255?255:b);
<span>111: </span>}
</pre>

<div>
<pre><span>223: </span><span>int</span> <span>write_byte_clamped</span>( <span>int</span> <span>byte</span> )
<span>224: </span>{
<span>225: </span>    putchar( byte &lt; 0 ? 0 : byte &gt; 255 ? 255 : byte );
<span>226: </span>}
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3b7761">
<h2 id="orgf3b7761">YCgCo Color Space</h2>
<div id="text-orgf3b7761">
<p>
The compressed image data is not actually encoded using the usual RGB color
space, though of course it outputs this at the end.  Instead, it uses the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCgCo">YCgCo</a> color space.  This is easily transformed back to RGB (<i>244–247</i>) but
has some nice properties where image compression is concerned.  Notably,
it decorrelates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance">chroma</a> data.
</p>

<p>
To see this, lets look at the just the Y (luma) color channel of the
built-in image.  We can do this by zeroing out the Cg (green–magenta) and
Co (orange–blue) chroma channels before transforming back to RGB:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/y.png" alt="y.png">

</figure>

<p>
Note how the result is simply the image in greyscale.
</p>

<p>
We can also look at the Cg channel in isolation by setting the Y values in
all pixels to 128 and the Co values in all pixels to zero.  This will show
us how the Cg data looks added to a neutral grey image:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/cg.png" alt="cg.png">

</figure>

<p>
And we can do likewise to view the Co channel in isolation by setting the Y
values to 128 and the Cg values to zero:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/co.png" alt="co.png">

</figure>

<p>
Hopefully it is clear now why this transform is useful: the majority of the
actual image detail is contained in the Y channel with only a little bit in
the Cg and Co channels.  Moreover, the human eye is more sensitive to
luminance than chrominance so by separating these out the encoder can
compress them with different degrees of lossiness.  This is why there are
not one but two image quality factors (<i>235–236</i>).
</p>

<p>
Many lossy image and video codecs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Downsampling">JPEG</a>, offer an option called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>.  When used, the luminance channel is typically stored
at full resolution while the chrominance channels are downscaled and stored
as a lower resolution image by the encoder, then upscaled by the decoder.
The tiny image decoder doesn’t bother with this.  Instead, the encoded
images just crank up the lossiness factor for the chrominance channels
(which JPEG images usually do too).
</p>

<p>
It’s also worth noting (<i>241–243</i>) that the decoder decompresses
the Y, Cg, and Co channels to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar format</a> in memory before writing the
transformed RGB values in the PPM-required <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_pixel">interleaved</a> form.

<h2 id="orgdf2665b">Quadtree Traversal</h2>
<div id="text-orgdf2665b">
<p>
The actual extraction of the image to these planes in memory occurs
completely within the function called at line 237.  This is the main
routine for the higher level decoding of the image and is by far the
largest function in the program:

<p>Why Should I Care?</p>



<p>Applications, even databases come and go, but data is the most important part of the story. Usually, data is the purpose of the system exists in the first place. That’s why we should consider a database system not only as a black box to hold our data, but also a tool to verify and guard it against corruptions.</p>



<p>This is achieved with a help of robust and well-thought database design. Of course, business logic is coded in the application layer and it makes sure data is in a proper format before arriving at the database. But who guarantees that a network failure or a bug will not allow corrupted “guests”? Also, the application layer is not the only “door” to the database. We can have import scripts, maintenance scripts, and mere mortal DBAs and developers interacting with it. Having preventive measures at a very low level ensures our data is always checked before stored.</p>



<p>Having robust, reliable data also helps with development and testing. Setting a column as a Not Null excludes many test scenarios assuming the emptiness of that column and also simplifies code freeing developers to check value [nearly] every time before accessing it.</p>



<p>Having stressed the importance of good database design, let’s have a look at the tools at our disposal to achieve it.</p>



<p>Normalization</p>

<p>This is of no doubt the first rule of good design. We are not going to delve into normalization rules here, just want to emphasize it’s importance. A good piece of reading about the topic could be&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article.</a></p>



<p>Data Types</p>



<p>Defining proper types for attributes is another thing that needs attention. This will not only improve the performance of the database but also validate the data before storing it. So we should keep numeric data in “integer”, “numeric” fields. Timestamps in “timestamp”, “timestamptz” fields. Booleans in “bit”, “char(1)” or “boolean” (whichever RDBMS supports) fields, etc.</p>



<p>Dates deserve a specific mention. If a Date attribute is supposed to have only the date part (OrderDate, ReleaseDate) use a type without a time portion (“date”). If you need to keep only the time (StartTime, EndTime) use a suitable time type. If you don’t need precision specify it as zero (“time(0)”). The problem with dates having a time portion is that you always have to cut off the time part to display only the date and make sure not to display yesterday or tomorrow when you format it in a different timezone than your database. Dates with time portion also may cause problems with subtracting and addition when hopping over daylight change dates.</p>

<p>Constraints</p>



<p>Constraints are our main topic of discussion today. They are what keeps invalid data out and ensures the robustness of it. Let’s look at them one by one.</p>



<p>Not Null Constraint</p>



<p>If business rules state that attribute should always be present, make it Not Null without hesitating. Good candidates to be Not Null are fields like Id, Name, AddedDate, IsActive, State, CategoryId (if all items should have a category), ItemCount, Price, and many others. Usually, these attributes play important roles in business logic. Other optional informative fields may still be Null.</p>



<p>But be careful not overusing Not Null constraint for attributes that CAN BE Null. For example, a long-running Task always has a StartTimestamp (Not Null), but EndTimestamp is updated only when the task finishes (Null). Or another classic example: Employee table has ManagerId, but not all employees have a manager. Don’t be tempted to make ManagerId Not Null and insert “0” or “-1” for employees that don’t have a manager. This will lead to other problems down the way when we will be adding Foreign Key constraints.</p>



<p>Unique Constraint</p>



<p>Again, depending on business rules, some attributes (or combinations of attributes) should be unique, such as Id, PinNumber, BookId and AuthorId, OrderNo, etc. These attributes should be made unique by adding Unique constraints. One more note: you may use Unique Index to achieve the same effect, but adding constraint is a better approach. Because when you add a Unique constraint a non-unique index is created automatically. So if for some reason you would have to temporarily disable/enable the constraint it’d be very easy. In the case of a unique index, you would have to drop/recreate the index which is an expensive operation in terms of performance degradation and time.</p>



<p>Primary Key</p>



<p>Not Null and Unique constraints together make up a Primary Key. Columns like Id or ObjectId quickly come to mind when we think of primary keys. But primary keys can also be composite, like BookId and AuthorId. The dilemma here is whether to have a separate Id column as a primary key, or make a composite primary key of them both? Having a separate Id column is usually a better method as it makes your joins cleaner and also allows easily add another column to a unique combination. However, having a separate primary key (Id) doesn’t free us from the need to add a Unique constraint to BookId and AuthorId columns.</p>



<p>Check Constraint</p>



<p>Check constraints allow us to define valid values/ranges for data. Perfect candidates for check constraints are Percent (between 0 and 100), State (0, 1, 2), Price, Amount, Total (greater than or equal to 0), PinNumber (fixed length), etc. Again don’t try to code business logic into check constraints. I remember a case when adding a Check constraint “greater than or equal to zero” to the AccountBalance column saved us from accidental over-drawing balances.</p>



<p>Default Constraint</p>



<p>Default constraints are also important. They allow us to add new Not Null columns to existing tables and make the “older” API to be compatible with the new structure until all parties are upgraded (though after complete upgrade default constraint should be removed).</p>



<p>One thing to remember here. Don’t code business logic into a Default constraint. For example function “now()” can be a good fit (though not always) as a default value for a Timestamp field in a Log table, but not for an OrderDate field in an Orders table. You may be tempted to omit OrderDate in inserts, relying on a default constraint and this means spreading your business logic down to the database level. Also at some point business may decide to assign OrderDate only after it has been approved and because the Default constraint is buried deep into the database it will not be obvious when we make changes to the code in the application layer.</p>



<p>Foreign Key Constraint</p>



<p>Foreign Key constraint is the king of the relational database design. Together with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys ensure data consistency at the inter-table level. Normalization rules tell us when to extract data into its table and reference it with Foreign keys. Here we will focus on subtle nuances, like OnDelete and OnUpdate rules.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy part: OnUpdate. Foreign keys reference primary keys and they are rarely (if ever) changed. So the OnUpdate rule is not very popular, but it makes sense to set it to Cascade, as sometimes we may have to update the primary keys of some rows (usually after migration). This way database will allow us to make the update and new ids will be propagated to the child tables.</p>



<p>OnDelete rule is a bit more complicated. Depending on the database we have options NoAction, Restrict, SetNull, SetDefault, and Cascade. So which one to choose?</p>



<p>NoAction is usually selected for keys referencing lookups or entities that can exist without referencing entity. For example, Products -&gt; Categories, Books -&gt; Authors, etc. Restrict in most cases is the same as NoAction, though for some databases there’re subtle <a href="https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/on-delete-restrict-vs-on-delete-no-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">differences</a>.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Cascade is selected when child records can not exist without their parent. In Book and Author example, when a book is removed we should remove records from the BookAuthor table too. Other examples: OrderDetails -&gt; Orders, PostComments -&gt; Posts etc. Here some of you may disagree that the database should not automatically remove child rows, they should be removed by the application layer. Depending on business logic, yes, that’s true. But sometimes “unimportant” child deletions can be delegated to the database.</p>



<p>SetNull is rarely used. For example, the Foreign key between Employee.ManagerId and Employee.Id can be Set Null. When a manager is removed (if ever) his subordinates become orphans. Obviously, this rule should be selected only if the column is nullable.</p>



<p>SetDefault is the rarest among his counterparts. It sets the column to its default value when the parent record is removed. Because foreign keys reference primary keys we can hardly imagine a hard-coded default value for a field with a foreign key. But anyway this option exists in case we need it.</p>



<p>Indexes</p>



<p>Indexes are an important part of good database design, but a bit off-topic for our discussion, as they do little to protect our data (except for unique indexes). One underwater rock to be aware of: some RDBMS systems (e.g. Oracle) will automatically create an index on foreign key creation and we don’t have to worry about that. Others (e.g. MS SQL Server) will not and we have to add indexes ourselves.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A well-thought design can save us many hours of coding, testing, and troubleshooting. Writing queries and reports against a well-designed database is a pleasure. Publishing and migrating that data to a new system is also very easy.</p>



<p>Opinions presented in this article are the result of many years dealing with various database systems. Some may be suitable for your case and some even contrary. So don’t take them for granted.</p>



<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <p>A while ago, the camera on my phone started acting up: opening it would show an image for a couple seconds but then go black. Simultaneously, when I turned my wireless headphones on there would be a couple seconds of sidetone (hearing through your own microphone) before it cut to the expected silence.</p>

<p>I promptly got a new phone and the old one was sent to forensics.</p>

<p>A little while after that, my stereo receiver started randomly losing its internet connection, causing streaming from Spotify to break. If I reset it to factory settings – and retrained the room calibration, speaker configuration, etc – it would come back, but within a week it would decide to give up on internet connectivity once again.</p>

<p>All of this was both frustrating and unnerving. We’ve become inured to the poor reliability and security of modern electronics – they are simply too complicated – and one thing I’ve had a hard time reconciling is my feeling that we <em>have</em> to do better with the reality that most things do not experience a strong economic pressure to do so. It is extraordinarily expensive to develop avionics software and other similar safety-critical things, and this is a sign to me both that the fundamental toolchain is broken and that most consumers simply don’t care. Even after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach">OPM hack</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks">DNC cyberattacks</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach">Equifax breach</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack">Sony Pictures hack</a> still no one has developed any good firewalls I would actually trust with my life. They are all too complex, composed of millions of lines of unproven code written by humans.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I see the problem as being the fact that the space of things a system <em>can</em> do being a tiny subset of things the systems is <em>physically capable</em> of doing.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://maxhodak.com/images/system-function-bubble.png">
</p>

<p>There is no meaningful difference between buggy software and insecure software – security vulnerabilities are just bugs used for a malicious intent. In order to build truly secure systems, we must shrink the space of things the machine is capable of doing to things we want it to do and formally prove this.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult to formally verify a program of any meaningful size. One common approach – used by some autopilots, among other things – is to write a model DSL and a small code generator that is feasible to formally verify, and then use that to generate the much larger source code of the actual program, which by extension is verified. This is a good idea and I’d love to see things like this used more widely.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use a language with lots of safety features like strong algebraic typing, immutable memory and no dynamic allocation. These are often functional languages and can go a long way towards making it so that if it compiles, it’s probably correct.</p>

<p>Ultimately you also need awareness of the hardware you are running on: no one was talking about speculative execution attacks five years ago, but now they’re just one example of practical attacks stemming from complex hardware performance optimizations.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://sel4.systems/">SeL4</a> and especially its verified <a href="https://riscv.org/2020/06/sel4-is-verified-on-risc-v/">RISCV implementation</a>. Yes, RISCV made some microarchitecture trade-offs that are somewhat academically pure at a cost to practicality, but for something like a brain implant you definitely want to prioritize making the intended-behavior and possible-behavior bubbles as close to equal as possible.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency world also feels these issues acutely: bugs in smart contracts quickly become large financial losses. Long term, I think the investments they are making into formal verification could be one of their largest contributions back to the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>These problems are all things Neuralink is going to have to invest in over time in order to ensure that the implants are reliable and secure. We will probably need to go way beyond traditional guidelines like MISRA and develop more powerful formal verification tools and code generation for verified hardware, but I think that’s only the tip of the iceberg towards systems that I’d really trust to put in my brain and connect to an increasingly hostile internet. There definitely needs to be much greater investment in these kinds of things, and hopefully an ecosystem develops that explores many possible approaches in parallel.</p>

    <p>First, I want to make it clear that I’m not accusing the compositor of true evil, which I define roughly as deliberately causing suffering. There’s unfortunately too much of that in the world. I mean it in the more metaphorical sense that it causes serious problems and forces other parts of the system to be more complex to work around its limitations.</p>

<p>I will also outline a better design that might be implemented in the future, as well as some possibilities for how applications can deal with the current situation. But first, to understand better how we got into this mess, we’ll look a bit into the past.</p>

<h2 id="8-bit-systems-video-processing-engines">8-bit systems: video processing engines</h2>

<p>Early home computers and video games had 8-bit CPUs and only a few kilobytes of RAM. Some computers, like the Apple II, allocated some of the RAM as a frame buffer and used the CPU to fill it, but this approach is quite limiting. So designers of most other systems of the time got creative - in particular, they augmented the CPU with a graphics processing engine. This engine did a fair amount of processing during <em>scanout,</em> in other words on the fly as the system generated a video signal.</p>

<p>The details of these early graphics processors varied, but most were a combination of four basic operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indirect lookup of tile images (also useful for text).</li>
  <li>Expansion of low bit depth pixels into more colors through a palette.</li>
  <li>Control over the offset in video memory to read (for scrolling effects).</li>
  <li>Overlay of small graphic elements (sprites).</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of even a modest CPU and one of these video processing engines led to a creative explosion of games, with a unique aesthetic formed from the primitives provided by the video chip: colorful scrolling backgrounds formed from tiles, with the player avatar and other characters overlaid, also moving dynamically. One of the most popular (and best documented) such chips is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">C64 VIC-II</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Processing_Unit">NES PPU</a> is another classic example. People still create software for these beloved systems, learning from tutorials such as <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/22/when-visibility-matters">VIC-II for beginners</a>.</p>

<p>While the constraints of the hardware served as artistic inspiration for a diverse and impressive corpus of games, they also limited the kind of visual expression that was possible. For example, any attempt at 3D was primitive at best (though there were driving games that did impressive attempts, using the scrolling and color palette mechanisms to simulate a moving roadway).</p>

<p>The most ambitious games and demos agressively poked at the hardware, “racing the beam” to dynamically manipulate the registers in the video chip, unlocking more colors and other graphical effects that no doubt were not even anticipated by the original designers of the hardware.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning as an extreme example is the Atari 2600, which had all of 20 bits (that’s right, two and a half bytes) devoted to what might be considered a frame buffer. Basically all graphical effects needed to be implemented by racing the beam. Fortunately, the programmer could make use of the deterministic cycle counts for instructions on the 6502 microprocessor, so that writes to the video registers would happen with timing considerably finer than one scan line. Even so, it requires some <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67b32347d5ca97d21a4c9e69a3b1a1a3">fairly tricky code</a> to even display the <a href="https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.6.0/embed.html?p=vcs&amp;r=TFpHAAAQAAAAAR1Ufls8AQMFDBJ42KIAiqjKmkjQ%2B6kOhQKFAErQ%2Ba2EAgyGCanGhQaFB6kAhQipGIUKDI%2BiJYUCytD7hgGgB4YNhg6GD4UCBADqEg%2BFEIURhQKI0PugEKIMeQ2FDrki8YUPuVXxhRu5ZfGFBLkz8YUNuUTxhQ4MFww%2BytDYuQAMSxEMCwyk6uoFDhyI0LKgOAUERgzH%2B6kChQGpIYUCjZYCBQOXTAvwABIeEgb8rFz4wPwE9BIDBPwAAPCgUPAw8ADwEgMA8AAAwMDAgADAQBIFwAUJNGwAqAULRDcSIRIR%2FxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh4SHBIIAPAA8A%3D%3D">Recurse Center logo</a> in all three colors.</p>

<p>An important aspect of all these systems, even those as underpowered as the Atari 2600, is that latency was <em>very</em> low. A well coded game might process the inputs during the vertical blanking interval, updating scroll and sprite coordinates (just a few register pokes), so they apply to the next frame being scanned out - latency under 16ms. Similar math applies to the latency of typing, which is why the Apple IIe <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">scores so well</a> on latency tests compared to modern computers.</p>

<h2 id="16-and-32-bit-home-computers-cpu--framebuffer">16 and 32 bit home computers: CPU + framebuffer</h2>

<p>Through the late 80s, while arcade games continued to evolve their graphics hardware, the IBM PC became ascendant as a home computer. From its roots as a “business” computer, its CPU performance and RAM grew dramatically, but video output was generally a framebuffer with almost none of the capabilities listed above. Even so, display resolutions and bit depths improved (VGA was 640x480 with 16 colors per pixel). A reasonably powerful CPU, especially in the hands of an expert coder, can produce rather impressive graphics. An example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, which had 3D graphics, fully drawn in software.</p>

<p>Another landmark release was the original Doom, released in 1993, which also was entirely software-rendered graphics, complete with lighting and textures.</p>

<p>The rendering of UI and 2D graphics continued to evolve during this time as well, with proportional spaced fonts becoming the standard, and <a href="http://www.truetype-typography.com/ttalias.htm">antialiased font rendering</a> slowly becoming standard as well during the 90s. (Likely the <a href="https://telcontar.net/Misc/GUI/RISCOS/#text">Acorn Archimedes</a> was the first to ship with antialiased text rendering, around 1992)</p>

<h2 id="multiple-windows-and-process-separation">Multiple windows and process separation</h2>

<p>A trend at the same time was the ability to run multiple applications, each with their own window. While the idea had been around for a while, it burst on to the scene with the Macintosh, and the rest of the world caught up shortly after.</p>

<p>Early implementations did <em>not</em> have “preemptive multitasking,” or what we would call process separation. Applications, even when running in windowed mode, wrote directly into the framebuffer. The platform basically provided a library for applications to keep track of visible regions, so they wouldn’t paint in regions where the window was occluded. Related, when an occluding window went away, the system would notify the application it needed to repaint (WM_PAINT on Windows), and, because computers were slow and this took a while, the “damage region” was visible for a bit (this is explained and animated in Jasper St. Pierre’s <a href="https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/x-basics.html">X Window System Basics</a> article).</p>

<p>In this early version of windowing GUI, latency wasn’t seriously affected. Some things were slower because resolution and bit depth was going up, and of course text needed to be rendered into bitmaps (more computationally expensive with antialiasing), but a well-written application could still be quite responsive.</p>

<p>However, running without process separation was a serious problem, if for no other reason than the fact that a misbehaving application could corrupt the entire system; consumer desktop systems were seriously behind the Unix/X11 ecosystem in this regard. System crashes were extremely common in the days of pre-X Mac OS, and pre-NT Windows (though Windows 95 had a limited form of process separation in that the display server bounded the window’s drawing area). Certainly in the Unix tradition, applications would run in their own process, with some kind of client-server protocol to combine the presentation of the multiple applications together. The X System (aka X11) came to dominate in Unix, but before that there were many other proposals, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">NeWS</a>. Also common to the Unix tradition, these would commonly run across a network.</p>

<h2 id="apples-aqua-compositor">Apple’s Aqua compositor</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0">OS X</a> (now macOS) first shipped in 2001, it was visually striking in a number of ways. Notably for this discussion, the contents of windows were blended with full alpha transparency and soft shadows. At the heart of this was a <em>compositor.</em> Applications did not draw directly to the screen, but to off-screen buffers which were then composited using a special process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor">Quartz Compositor</a>.</p>

<p>In the first version, all the drawing and compositing was done in software. Since machines at the time weren’t particularly powerful, performance was bad. According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2/">retrospective review</a>, “in its initial incarnation, Aqua was unbearably slow and a huge resource hog.”</p>

<p>Even so, things improved. By 10.2 (Jaguar) in August 2002, Quartz Extreme did the compositing in the GPU, finally making performance comparable to pre-compositor designs.</p>

<p>While there have been changes (discussed in some detail below), Quartz Compositor is fundamentally the modern compositor design used today. Microsoft Vista adopted a similar design with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview">DWM</a>, first in Vista, and made non-optional by Windows 8. Also, while I consider Aqua the first real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositor</a> in the modern sense, there were important predecessors, notably the Amiga. Jasper St. Pierre points out that Windows 2000 had a limited compositor, known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-features#layered-windows">“layered windows”</a>, where certain windows could be redirected offscreen.</p>

<h2 id="doing-more-in-the-compositor">Doing more in the compositor</h2>

<p>Using the GPU to just bitblt window contents is using a tiny fraction of its capabilities. In the compositing process, it could be fading in and out alpha transparency, sliding subwindows around, and applying other effects without costing much at all in performance (the GPU is already reading all the pixels from the offscreen buffers and writing to the display surface). The only trick is exposing these capabilities to the application.</p>

<p>On the Apple side, this was driven by iOS and its heavy reliance on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">Core Animation</a>. The idea is that “layers” can be drawn using relatively slow software rendering, then scrolling and many other effects can be done smoothly at 60fps by compositing these layers in the GPU.</p>

<p>Core Animation was also made available in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). The corresponding Windows version was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal">DirectComposition</a>, introduced in Windows 8 and a core feature of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro</a> design language (which was not very popular at the time).</p>

<p>These features have made the compositor more integral to modern GUI software, though there is a range of how aggressively applications make use of compositor feature.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-latency-come-from">Where does the latency come from?</h2>

<p>I talk a lot about latency, but let’s understand why introducing the compositor fundamentally adds so much of it. Some of this is also discussed in the blog post <a href="http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/dwm_latency.html">Desktop compositing latency is real and it annoys me</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15747650">HN discussion</a>).</p>

<p>The amount of time needed to render a frame of content varies. If the goal is smooth 60fps (as I think it should be!) then …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

September 13, 2020 | https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/08/how-do-computers-generate-random-numbers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/08/how-do-computers-generate-random-numbers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 40,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 40,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNG</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;This was meant to be a high-level introduction into this topic. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators#Pseudorandom_number_generators_(PRNGs)">here a few other PRNGs to consider. </a> </p>

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-13-bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/cover.png" alt="illustration">
Back in spring 2020 at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
we were looking to replace our <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>-<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
duo by a more lightweight framework to power our future Kotlin microservices.
We did some detailed (at times philosophical) theoretical comparisons that I much enjoyed,
but these cannot substitute a hands-on experience.
We decided to implement proof-of-concept microservices using the most viable frameworks,
stressing them in a benchmark along the way.
While <strong>Kotlin</strong> was the main language,
I saw this as an opportunity to have some fun at home and test (my proficiency with) <strong>Rust</strong>,
which is touted for being fast.
I ended up stress-testing Kotlinâ€™s <a href="https://www.http4k.org/"><strong>Http4k</strong></a>, <a href="https://ktor.io/"><strong>Ktor</strong></a>,
and Rustâ€™s <a href="https://actix.rs/"><strong>Actix</strong> Web</a>, read on to see how they fared.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <a href="#the-results">jump to the results</a> and read the background later, if youâ€™re impatient.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">On TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Why not just refer to excellent <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">TechEmpower Benchmarks (TEB)</a>?</p>

<p>A very valid question to ask. A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submitted TEB implementations tend to be rather optimised.
We wanted to measure such a code style that we would normally write:
one striving to be simple/idiomatic/readable,
but finished promptly and not extensively profiled.
On the other hand, we wanted to include production-grade API error handling
(correct HTTP codes and JSON error messages listing problems of individual parameters etc.),
request logging, and OpenAPI (Swagger) spec generation.</li>
  <li>Besides high-water req/s performance and associated latencies,
we wanted to capture more operational characteristics like memory usage, CPU usage and efficiency,
along the lifetime of a microservice instance.</li>
  <li>In production, we run our microservices in a rather high-density Kubernetes cluster,
where every instance has to be CPU- and memory-constrained.
We wanted to simulate this environment
and check whether we can use trending â€œserverlessâ€� offerings for new services.</li>
  <li>Our data store, Elasticsearch, differs from ones included in TEB,
and we were curious how synchronous vs. asynchronous flavours of the Elasticsearch client compare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-service">The Service</h2>

<p>For a description of the service to implement &amp; benchmark,
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/api-spec.md">see its API Spec document available in the locations-rs repository</a>.</p>

<p>We benchmark its simplest <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint,
whose work is to look up a <code>city</code> document by id in Elasticsearch,
look up associated <code>region</code> document,
and render response JSON.
It uses internal in-memory cache for regions (there is just tens of them),
but no cache for much more numerous cities.</p>

<p>To reduce bandwidth when fetching documents from Elasticsearch,
all implementations instruct it to strip (at least) the largest property <code>geometry</code>.
This property is only used in Elasticsearch-side filtering, not by the microservice.
I believe the stripping significantly strains Elasticsearch
(or rather transfers the strain from the microservice to it).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark">The Benchmark</h2>

<h3 id="recipe">Recipe</h3>

<p>The benchmark consists of multiple identical â€œrunsâ€� for each Dockerised implementation spawned
by <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/bench-3-impls.py">bench-3-impls.py</a>.
The runs are named after the implementation and their ordinal number,
thus <code>rs-actix-1</code> is the first run of the Rust (Actix) implementation,
and <code>kt-ktor-3</code> is the third run of Kotlin (Ktor) implementation.</p>

<p>Each run simulates the first couple of minutes of the microservice instance using <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/test-image.py">test-image.py</a>.
Steps of one run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Docker container is started, measuring the time until the service starts responding,</li>
  <li>a suite of HTTP checks is made ensuring correct responses and error handling behaviour,</li>
  <li>HTTP load is generated using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>
in a series of 10-second long steps with increasing concurrent connection count;
the metrics are collected from <code>wrk</code> and Docker API after each step:
    <ul>
      <li>first 5 steps use just one concurrent connection, acting as a warm-up,</li>
      <li>each of the next 11 steps doubles concurrent connection count, i.e. continuing with 2, 4,
8, â€¦, 1024, 2048.<sup id="fnref:conn-count" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conn-count">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all runs are plotted using the awesome <a href="http://www.pygal.org/">Pygal</a> library
in <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/render-tests.py">render-tests.py</a>.
Different runs of a single implementation use the same colour,
allowing for visual inspection of the variance between them.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Docker is told to constrain resources available to the microservice containers,
a practice usual in typical Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>The CPU is limited to 1.5 CPU-units using an equivalent of the <code>--cpus=1.5</code> Docker option.
This means that even though the instance has access to all 4 CPU cores of the machine,
it can use only 15 CPU-seconds (out of theoretical 40 CPU-seconds) in each 10-wall-clock-second step.
The value of 1.5 was chosen small enough to ensure the tested microservice is the actual bottle-neck during the benchmark,
and large enough to assert frameworks make proper use of multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>Memory is limited to 512 MiB. I argue that anything beyond 512 MiB should not be called a <em>micro</em>service.</p>

<p>The two JVM-hosted Kotlin implementations run in OpenJDK 11,
with <code>-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75</code> as the sole option.
It should allow JVM to allocate up to 75% of available 512 MiB memory to Java heap.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>The benchmarks run on 2 Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine
located in the same zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st VM, <code>n2d-highcpu-4</code> machine type (4 AMD Epyc <em>Rome</em> vCPUs, 4 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the benchmarked microservice in a Docker container <em>and</em> the <code>wrk</code> load generator.</li>
      <li>As the container is limited to 1.5 CPU and <code>wrk</code> takes less than leftover 2.5 CPUs,
they should not affect each other.</li>
      <li>Indeed, the maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 70%.</li>
      <li>The N2D <a href="https://www.quortex.io/post/an-open-source-framework-to-benchmark-cloud-providers-performances-for-live-streaming">machine type is said to have the best performance/cost ratio on GCP and even across cloud providers</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2nd VM, <code>e2-custom</code> machine type
(12 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/understanding-dynamic-resource-management-in-e2-vms">high-density vCPUs</a>, 6 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs a stock Dockerised Elasticsearch 7.8.0 instance, storage backend for the microservices.</li>
      <li>Maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 80% â€”
I have scaled the number of Elasticsearch CPU cores up until it ceased to be a bottleneck, arriving at 12.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>We also initially implemented a Kotlin proof-of-concept in <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>,
but it turned out none of the team members was keen on the programming paradigm this framework suggested
(which may be a subjective matter), so we hadnâ€™t proceeded further with it.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-http4k">The Story of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code></h3>

<p>Http4k Locations service was written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>.
It became the production implementation at GoOut
and is thus most complete along with extras like Swagger serving.</p>

<p>Http4k <a href="https://www.http4k.org/guide/modules/servers/">allows one to select from several server backends</a>,
so we first need to do a qualification benchmark and select the best performing engine to be fair.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-server-engines-pub/bench-results.html"><strong>Kttp4k server engine results on a dedicated page</strong></a>.
Line labels on the graph correspond to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tags">tags in the locations-kt-http4k repository</a>.</p>

<p>One nice side-effect of this benchmarking was that
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141#issuecomment-679330954">discovered a cause</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141"><strong>Netty</strong> backend performance issue</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/pull/480">@<strong>daviddenton</strong> was quick to fix it</a>.
The <code>netty-updfix-*</code> graphs, which exhibit some nice latency characteristics, already contain the fix.
It was later released in http4k v3.259.0 (be sure to upgrade if you use this backend).</p>

<p><strong>Apache HttpCore</strong> version 4.4, labelled as <code>apache4-*</code>, was most CPU-efficient backend
and achieved shared first place in peak req/s performance.
However, it tends to draw too much memory as the number of concurrent connections grows,
and is out-of-memory-killed once their number reaches (extreme) 1024.
Apache HttpCore version 5.0 (<code>apache-*</code>) and a variant with lowered socket backlog (<code>apache-q100-*</code>)
suffer from the same problem.
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/481">opened an issue</a> to see if thatâ€™s a bug or not,
insights welcome.
Meanwhile, I would recommend different http4k backends for services not shielded by load balancers.</p>

<p>The winner of this qualification round is the <strong>Undertow</strong> backend
(<code>undertow-*</code> for v3.163.0 and <code>undertow-upd-*</code> for v3.258.0),
which shares the first place in high-water req/s performance,
but also brings good all-round results in the rest of the metrics,
especially memory consumption under load.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jetty</strong> backend (<code>jetty-*</code>) slightly but consistently lags behind other production engines
in most metrics.
For completeness, I have also included the <strong>SunHttp</strong> backend that is intended for development only,
which the benchmarks confirm.</p>

<p><em>Update: Http4k author <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/issues/1">has pointed out that OpenAPI generation through Contracts API may incur some performance penalty</a>.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-contractless/bench-results.html"><strong>Benchmarks confirm that removing the Contracts layer indeed increases performance</strong></a>, shifting Http4k closer to Ktor.
Graphs below reflect the original version with Contracts (OpenAPI support).</em></p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-ktor">The Story of <code>locations-kt-ktor</code></h3>

<p>Ktor variant was also written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
I later tweaked the <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint for functional parity with other implementations.
It remains the least complete implementation with just this single endpoint.</p>

<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client">es-kotlin-wrapper-client</a> to wrap
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-getting-started-asynchronous-usage.html">intrinsic async API of the Elasticsearch client</a>
into Kotlin coroutines.</p>

<p>Ktor also allows for pluggable HTTP server engines which I benchmarked.
See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-ktor-server-engines/bench-results.html"><strong>Ktor server engine benchmarks page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is similar here with <strong>Netty</strong> being more efficient and performant than <strong>Jetty</strong>,
thus qualified as Ktorâ€™s engine of choice for the main benchmark.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-rs">The story of <code>locations-rs</code></h3>

<p>I wrote the Rust clone in my free time, closely following the development of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code>.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iqq8k9/announcing_actixweb_v30/">Actix Web 3.0 was <em>just</em> released</a>
and I was eager to compare how it fares against v2.0 performance-wise.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-actix-versions/bench-results.html"><strong>The one-to-one benchmark shows v3.0 is at least on par with v2.0</strong></a>.
I think thatâ€™s good news given that v3.0 …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Understanding the Problem</h2><p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1398/problem/B">Substring Removal Game</a> is an 800-point problem at codeforces, I&nbsp;hope you have read the problem carefully and have tried thinking about solving it. This problem basically states as its name sounds to say, to remove a substring.</p><p>Per each test, you're given a string of binary characters (0's and 1's)&nbsp;and you're required to remove each consecutive 1's to make Alice win. Who is Alice? Alice and Bob are players in the game, and the winner is the one who removes the highest numbers of 1's. Your duty is to make Alice win given that Alice is the first to move.</p><h2>How to Think for a Solution</h2><p>This problem has two inputs:</p><ul role="list"><li>input for test cases</li><li>input for each string of binary characters per each test case</li></ul><p>You can think of this problem as capturing all consecutive ones in the string first and then we can make a decision on which 1's we should focus on to make Alice win. For example, if the input is 01111001 this means that we have 4 consecutive 1's and then just 1; to make Alice win in this case, we should make her take that move which is obviously her first move already and then Bob can take the second move which is the last 1 in the string.</p><p>Let's have another example, 111111 these are 6 ones which can be the first move for Alice so 6 moves will be her win.</p><p>How about this tricky one:&nbsp;101010101?</p><p>So there are 5 ones .. which of them should be Alice's moves? That would be the first and the third and the fifth .. so here 3 moves for Alice.</p><p>What for this one:&nbsp;011011110111?</p><p>Here, we have 2 consecutive ones, 4 consecutive ones, and 3 consecutive ones. Which moves can make Alice win? so we need then to think how we can make number of moves the highest possible so if we sort numbers of consecutive ones in descending order and then start on the highest number that would give us the first move for Alice, and the second move should be a step two from that one. So in this case:&nbsp;[4 3 2] Alice will take moves 4 and 2 which sum up to 6.</p><p>‍</p><p>That's how I&nbsp;thought about this problem and below is my implementations in Python and Javascript:</p><h2>Python</h2><p>‍</p><h2>Javascript</h2><p>‍</p><h2>Shoutout</h2><p>I'd like to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE8qf5sfn4Y&amp;ab_channel=codeExplainer">this video</a> because the idea of solving this solution is from this guy. Check out his solution in C++&nbsp;if you're interested.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

September 13, 2020 | https://aparcar.org/running-openwrt-with-selinux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aparcar.org/running-openwrt-with-selinux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>This blog post describes the creation and testing of OpenWrt images running
SELinux to improve security. The support is still limited and not ready for any
productive usage, however this post should give a basic idea of its current
state.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Back in November 2019 Thomas Petazzoni sent a <a href="https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2019-November/025973.html">first patchset</a> adding optional
SELinux support to OpenWrt. Due to the complexity of integrating SELinux into
the OpenWrt build system and missing bits in the patchset, the patches never
made it into the main branch.</p>
<p>In July 2020 W. Michael Petullo gave the patchset a <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/3207">second spin</a>, updated
legacy Python2 to Python3, rebased everything and reworked all change requests
from the reviewers. Special thanks to Daniel Golle. Due to the deep integration
of SELinux inside the operating system special versions of <code>busybox</code>, <code>procd</code>
and <code>f2fs-tools</code> <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/3303">were created</a>, keeping the regular (non SELinux)
images small while allowing to integrate the additional SELinux feature via
package installations.</p>
<h2 id="creating-images">Creating images</h2>
<p>To try SELinux on OpenWrt it is currently required to compile the Kernel with
additional options. There are ideas to provide dual Kernel ImageBuilders with a
regular and a SELinux ready version, however this isn’t ready just yet.</p>
<p>You’ll need a OpenWrt <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/quickstart-build-images">build system</a> and a bit of time!</p>
<p>As of 2020/09 only <code>x86/64</code>, <code>armvirt/64</code> and <code>ath79/generc</code> using a <em>squashfs</em>
filesystem where tested with SELinux, if you use a different target, please
share your results.</p>
<p>The following build options are required:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Global build settings -&gt;
	<span># CONFIG_TARGET_ROOTFS_SECURITY_LABELS=y</span>
	<span>[</span>*<span>]</span> Enable rootfs security labels

	Kernel build options -&gt;
		<span># CONFIG_KERNEL_SECURITY_SELINUX=y</span>
		<span>[</span>*<span>]</span> NSA SELinux Support
</code></pre></div><p>These options will automatically select the package <code>refpolicy</code> to set labels
inside the created <code>squashfs</code> filesystem.</p>
<p>Select the SELinux variants of <code>procd</code>, <code>busybox</code> and (optionally)
<code>mkf2fs</code>. Be sure to deselect the <em>regular</em> versions as there is currently
a dependency error if both variants are selected.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Base system -&gt;
	&lt;*&gt; busybox-selinux
	&lt;*&gt; procd-selinux

Utilities -&gt;
	Filesystem -&gt;
		<span># optional: only if target uses f2fs</span>
		&lt;*&gt; mkf2fs-selinux			
</code></pre></div><h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>The following will run an <code>armvirt/64</code> image:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">BIN_DIR<span>=</span>./bin/targets/armvirt/64

Now itâ€™s grades, but tomorrow it may be â€œRich people are evil, Iâ€™m not evilâ€�. </p><p>You may feel good about yourself, but if you follow this idea, you wonâ€™t get what you want. Instead, ask the question: â€œHow can I get good grades and *not kiss up?â€� Find people like that and learn from them.</p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>Anytime you want something that you donâ€™t have, this thinking will materialize. â€œOh people who are fit spend so much time in the gym, Iâ€™m not that kind of personâ€�, etc etc. Be careful about the constraints you set with your ideas.</em></p><p><strong>Be wary of all or nothing thinking</strong></p><p>Slave morality can get hard to swallow, so they may say â€” <em>but grades are unfair. Even if I do well the teacher can knock me for â€œparticipationâ€�, thatâ€™s why the kiss-up people get good grades.</em></p><p>Youâ€™re right. This is frustrating and unfair. And thereâ€™s a reason some people kiss up: itâ€™s easier to do that. But, just because some parts are unfair and some people cheat, doesnâ€™t mean you should give up on what you want. The world isnâ€™t so black and white.</p><p><em>Tell yourself: you will do whatâ€™s under your control.</em> Learn from the people you admire who behave the way you think is right. Yes some people have an advantage, yes some things are plain unfair, but you can still get what you want. If you do all of that and it doesn't work, you'll know you tried your best, and something better will certainly happen regardless. </p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>I remember Ramit Sethi telling the story of someone who wanted to start working out, but only had one day free a week. Instead of working out once a week, they didnâ€™t work out at all. They thought it had to be 5 times a week. The more you can let go of the black and white nature of childhood, the more youâ€™ll flourish</em></p><p><strong>Be wary of comfort</strong></p><p>A final interjection may come from comfort â€” <em>I want to learn this thing, but I donâ€™t want to look dumb, etc.</em>  </p><p>If you lived in our village, youâ€™d be <em>prettyy cool.</em> Wow you study in the big city, wow, you know so much math, wow you are good at fighting.</p><p>But imagine if you met a navy seal from Afghanistan. How do you think your fighting skill would stack up?</p><p>If you <em>actually</em> want to become great, you have to get outside of your comfort zone<em>.</em> Actively look for those opportunities. Youâ€™ll have an urge to drop them because you want to feel coolâ€¦but hey itâ€™s better to <em>be</em> cool then to <em>feel</em> cool</p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>Ask yourself constantly, where are the people I can learn from? It can be uncomfortable to go from the best person in the room to a <a href="http://paulgraham.com/noob.html" target="_blank">noob</a>, but this is the path forward</em> </p><p><strong>Appreciations</strong> </p><p>Many of these ideas crystallized by reading two people have inspired me: Nassim Taleb and Paul Graham. Nassim for elucidating the life of the flaneur, and Paul for his essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html" target="_blank">â€œWhat youâ€™d wish youâ€™d knownâ€�</a></p><p><em>Thanks to Nino Parunashvili, Elene Asanidze, Alex Reichert, Julien Odent for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><span>At Uber, real-time analytics allow us to attain business insights and operational efficiency, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to improve experiences on the Uber platform. For example, our operations team relies on data to monitor the market health and spot potential issues on our platform; software powered by machine learning models leverages data to predict rider supply and driver demand; and data scientists use data to improve machine learning models for better forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span>In the past, we have utilized many third-party database solutions for real-time analytics, but none were able to simultaneously address all of our functional, scalability, performance, cost, and operational requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>Released in November 2018, AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. An emerging tool for real-time analytics, GPU technology has advanced significantly over the years, making it a perfect fit for real-time computation and data processing in parallel. </span></p>
<p><span>In the following sections, we describe the design of AresDB and how this powerful solution for real-time analytics has allowed us to more performatively and efficiently unify, simplify, and improve Uber’s real-time analytics database solutions. After reading this article, we hope you try out AresDB for your own projects and find the tool useful your own analytics needs, too! </span></p>
<h3>Real-time analytics applications at Uber</h3>
<p><span>Data analytics are crucial to the success of Uber’s business. Among other functions, these analytics are used to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Build </span><b>dashboards</b><span> to monitor our business metrics</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>automated decisions</b><span> (such as </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>trip pricing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/advanced-technologies-detecting-preventing-fraud-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fraud detection</span></a><span>) based on aggregated metrics that we collect</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>ad hoc queries</b><span> to diagnose and troubleshoot business operations issues</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We can summarize these functions into categories with different requirements as follows:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Dashboards</b></td>
<td><b>Decision Systems</b></td>
<td><b>Ad hoc Queries</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Pattern</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Arbitrary </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query QPS</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Latency</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Dataset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>All data</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span>Dashboards and decision systems leverage real-time analytical systems to make similar queries over relatively small, yet highly valuable, subsets of data (with maximum data freshness) at high QPS and low latency.</span></p>
<h4>The need for another analytical engine</h4>
<p><span>The most common problem that real-time analytics solves at Uber is how to compute time series aggregates, calculations that give us insight into the user experience so we can improve our services accordingly. With these computations, we can request metrics by specific dimensions (such as day, hour, city ID, and trip status) over a time range on arbitrarily filtered (or sometimes joined) data. Over the years, Uber has deployed multiple solutions to solve this problem in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the third-party solutions we’ve used for solving this type of problem include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Apache Pinot</b></a><span>, an open source distributed analytical database written in Java, can be leveraged for large-scale data analytics. Pinot employs a lambda architecture internally to query batch and real-time data in columnar storage, uses inverted bitmap index for filtering, and relies on star-tree for aggregate result caching. However, it does not support key-based deduplication, upsert, joins, and advanced query features such as geo-spatial-filtering. In addition, being a JVM-based database, query execution on Pinot runs at a higher cost in terms of memory usage.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Elasticsearch</b></a><span> is used at Uber for a variety of streaming analytics needs. It was built on Apache </span><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Lucene</span></a><span> for full-text keyword search that stores documents and inverted index. It has been widely adopted and extended to also support aggregates. The inverted index enables filtering, yet it is not optimized for time range-based storage and filtering. It stores records as JSON documents, imposing additional storage and query access overhead. Like Pinot, Elasticsearch is a JVM-based database, and as such, does not support joins and its query execution runs at a higher memory cost. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While these technologies have strengths of their own, they lacked crucial functionalities for our use case. We needed a unified, simplified, and optimized solution, and thought outside-of-the-box (or rather, inside the GPU) to reach a solution.</span></p>
<h3>Leveraging GPUs for real-time analytics</h3>
<p><span>To render realistic views of images at a high frame rate, GPUs process a massive amount of geometries and pixels in parallel at high speed. While the clock-rate increase for processing units has plateaued over the past few years, the number of transistors on a chip has only increased per </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moore’s law</span></a><span>. As a result, GPU computation speeds, measured in Gigaflops per second (GFLOP/s), are rapidly increasing. Figure 1, below, depicts the theoretical GFLOP/s trend comparing NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs over the years:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5345"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png 1999w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-300x157.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-768x402.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1024x536.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-696x365.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1068x559.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-802x420.png 802w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1920x1006.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5345">Figure 1: Comparison of CPU and GPU single precision floating point performance through the years. Image taken from Nvidia’s CUDA C programming guide.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>When designing our real-time analytics querying engine, integrating GPU processing was a natural fit. At Uber, the typical real-time analytical query processes a few days of data with millions to billions of records and then filters and aggregates them in a short amount of time. This computation task fits perfectly into the parallel processing model of general purpose GPUs because they:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Process data in parallel very quickly. </span></li>
<li><span>Deliver greater computation throughput (GFLOPS/s), making them a good fit for heavy computation tasks (per unit data) that can be parallelized. </span></li>
<li><span>Offer greater compute-to-storage (ALU to GPU global memory) data access throughput (not latency) compared to central processing units (CPUs), making them ideal for processing I/O (memory)-bound parallel tasks that require a massive amount of data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Once we settled on using a GPU-based analytical database, we assessed a few existing analytics solutions that leveraged GPUs for our needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kinetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Kinetica</b></a><span>, a GPU-based analytics engine, was initially marketed towards U.S. military and intelligence applications in 2009. While it demonstrates the great potential of GPU technology in analytics, we found many key features missing</span> <span>for our use case, including </span><span>schema alteration, partial insertion or updates, data compression, column-level memory/disk retention configuration, and join by geospatial relationships.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.omnisci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>OmniSci</b></a><span>, an open source, SQL-based query engine, seemed like a promising option, but as we evaluated the product, we realized that it did not have critical</span><span> features for Uber’s use case, such as deduplication. While </span><span>OminiSci</span> <span>open sourced their project in 2017, after some analysis of their C++-based solution, we concluded that neither contributing back nor forking their codebase was viable.</span></li>
<li><span>GPU-based real-time analytics engines, including </span><a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/gpuqp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUQP</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://cogadb.dfki.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CoGaDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p817-yuan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p709-heimel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ocelot</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1374-he.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OmniDB</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://github.com/bakks/virginian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Virginian</span></a><span>, are frequently used by academic institutions. However, given their academic purpose, these solutions focus on developing algorithms and designing proof of concepts as opposed to handling real-world production scenarios. For this reason, we discounted them for our scope and scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, </span><span>these engines</span><span> demonstrate the great advantage and potential of data processing using GPU technology, and they inspired us to build our own GPU-based, real-time analytics solution tailored to Uber’s needs. With these concepts in mind, we built and open sourced AresDB.</span></p>
<h3>AresDB architecture overview</h3>
<p><span>At a high level, AresDB stores most of its data in host memory (RAM that is connected to CPUs), handling data ingestion using CPUs and data recovery via disks. At query time, AresDB transfers data from host memory to GPU memory for parallel processing on GPU. As shown in Figure 2, below, AresDB consists of a memory store, a meta datastore, and a disk store:</span></p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p><span>Unlike most </span><span>relational database management systems (</span><span>RDBMSs), there is no database or schema scope in AresDB. All tables belong to the same scope in the same AresDB cluster/instance, enabling users to refer to them directly. Users store their data as fact tables and dimension tables.</span></p>
<h5>Fact table</h5>
<p><span>A fact table stores an infinite stream of time series events. Users use a fact table to store events/facts that are happening in real time, and each event is associated with an event time, with the table often queried by the event time. An example of the type of information stored by fact tables are trips, where each trip is an event and the trip request time is often designated as the event time. In case an event has multiple timestamps associated with it, only one timestamp is designated as the time of the event displayed in the fact table.</span></p>
<h5>Dimension table</h5>
<p><span>A dimension table stores current properties for entities (including cities, clients, and drivers). For example, users can store city information, such as city name, time zone, and country, in a dimension table. Compared to fact tables, which grow infinitely over time, dimension tables are always bounded by size (e.g., for Uber, the cities table is bounded by the actual number of cities in the world). Dimension tables do not need a special time column.</span></p>
<h4>Data types</h4>
<p><span>Table below details the current data types supported in AresDB:</span></p>

She co-edited a book in 1993 that became known to many as an early manifesto for feminist economics, and has spent her career questioning assumptions - of both the human mind and the discipline of economics.</p><p>She is an economics professor (emeritus) at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, a senior research fellow at the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts, and a senior assistant teacher at the Greater Boston Zen Center.

<p>It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong.</p>



<p>The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Don’t Make Me Think</a> thesis.</p>



<p><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, the seminal web usability book by Steve Krug, tells us that products should be as simple as possible for users to use. Products shouldn’t be self-explanatory (ie understandable given a set of instructions), they should be self-evident (ie so obvious that they can be used <em>without</em> having to read instructions). A good door has a push/pull sign to make it self-explanatory, but it still requires you to read and think. An even better door wouldn’t even need that label at all—you know what to do instinctively.</p>



<p>But somehow, we’ve perverted that idea. Users are lazy, even stupid, we say. They just want to flick their fingers down an infinite feed, letting their eyes wander from item to item.</p>



<p>But in <em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, Krug never refers to users in a derogatory way. He tells us how good products should work, and why basic psychology supports that. People want to reduce cognitive friction as much as possible. People don’t like unneeded cognitive friction. People skim quickly and “muddle through” products. And, most of all, people won’t undertake effort unless they believe it’s worth the cost. These are all facts backed by usability research and psychology.</p>



<p>In other words, he tells us <em>what</em> good products should look like, and <em>how</em> people use them. But he doesn’t pass judgment on users. That’s up to us.</p>



<p>And so naturally, we apply our view of the world, our values. If you view your users with contempt, then the reason behind why people don’t like complicated products is because they are stupid and lazy. If, on the other hand, you <em>respect</em> your users, you might view things differently.</p>



<p>Firstly, our brains have been wired, through millions of years of evolution, to conserve effort and time. That’s actually not being lazy, it’s being smart and protective of one of our most valuable assets. Naturally, we don’t undertake an activity unless we believe it’s worth the cost (though there are ways to trick us, more on that later). And if it takes effort to even figure out how much effort an activity will require, we’ll avoid that activity altogether. That’s the functional, practical piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>Secondly, we are a complex bundle of emotions. Even if we’re smart, we don’t like <em>feeling</em> stupid. And complex, difficult things makes us feel stupid. They strike at our very identity and self-worth. So we try to avoid them like we avoid that hard topic we were never good at in school. <em>That</em> part is the emotional piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>So what explains the rise of products like Facebook, which have gotten a large part of humanity mindlessly scrolling through feeds of what can most easily be described as garbage content? Well, we humans aren’t perfect. If you’ve got billions of dollars, some of the brightest minds, and a lot of data at your disposal, you can get a lot of people to do what you want. If you treat users as stupid and lazy, you can turn them into stupid and lazy people in the context of your product… but that’s a subject for another post.</p>



<p>So here’s how I think about people and product design.</p>



<p>Firstly, products should definitely be as simple as possible. Because I <em>respect </em>users’ time, not because I look down on their intelligence.</p>



<p>Second, have a theory of how people behave. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">Self-determination Theory</a>, which states that people value autonomy, relatedness, and competence. And I love building product that help people improve all those three dimensions.</p>



<p>Three, have a set of principles for your product. For instance, of the three axes of self-determination, I particularly care about autonomy (control). And I’ve found that good products, ones that respect their users, <em>give them more control</em>. Bad products <em>take away control</em>. Simplicity can fulfill both of those purposes. It can give people control by abstracting away things they don’t care about and helping them focus. Or it can take away control by only letting users do things the product’s designers want them to do. So that’s one of my principles: give people control. Help them do things <em>they </em>want to do, not things <em>you</em> want them to do.</p>



<p>Let’s respect our users. Technology can bring out the best or worst in us, both individually and collectively. Let’s focus on the best.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The above article is what I wrote, in its half-formed state on a Sunday morning. It looks like it’s blowing up on HackerNews, so I wanted to just add a few points.</p>



<ul><li>I know I can come across as idealistic. I’ve even gotten that as feedback on a formal performance review (but also, I’ve gotten that I’m cynical, so *shrug*). I’m not saying people can’t be lazy, entitled, or stupid. We can. We have that <em>capacity</em>. But we have the <em>capacity</em> for so much more than that. And we should focus our tools, our technology, on our best capacities.</li><li>If Self-determination Theory resonates with you, I’d urge you to think about how it applies to building teams or even parenting. Your employees and colleagues, or your children and family members, have all the human capacities as well (though obviously, for children, they are still under development). Since I’m much more experienced at managing teams (dozen years) than being a parent (two years), I’ll just say that companies that view employees as lazy and incompetent are a scourge. If you can afford to avoid working at companies like that, try your best. And if you’re tasked with building companies or teams, you get to choose. You still need rules, hierarchies, and processes, but if you give people autonomy and relatedness/purpose, and trust their competence, I hope you’ll be pleasantly surprised. If you treat employees as stupid and lazy, they will be.</li><li>On simplicity vs. control/flexibility: I’m a big fan of the Alan Kay quote that “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>.” I think great products find a way of achieving both those objectives. You keep things simple, but don’t throw out the baby with the bath-water. Like the word processor. 99% of the time, you just want to type some text, so you get a cursor and WYSIWIG typing. But sometimes, you want to style, you want to indent, you want to program macros. We apply this principle often at <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> (personal finance platform that I’m working on) and so far have found it to be quite successful.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post covers why I believe local and national governments should
adopt and invest in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS).</p>

<p>This has been in the news recently due to the city of Munich renewing 
it’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-not-windows-why-munich-is-shifting-back-from-microsoft-to-open-source-again/">LiMux Linux distribution</a>
thanks to an agreement between the local SDP and Green politicians, and
the efforts of the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money, Public Code</a> campaign.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>

<h2 id="limux">LiMux</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux">LiMux</a> is a project by the German city of Munich to migrate its desktop
infrastructure to FOSS solutions, specifically to the LiMux Linux
distribution (based on Ubuntu) and LibreOffice (initially to OpenOffice). The project was started in 2004, and
migration began in 2006.</p>

<p>By the end of 2013, 15,000 desktops had been migrated successfully.
However, in September 2016 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-germany-moves-into-a-new-headquarters/">Microsoft announced the opening of a new headquarters in Munich</a>, and then
in 2017 the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10/">city council decided to switch back to Microsoft Windows and Office</a>.
The timing of this decision led to many accusations of effective
bribery, using the potential office opening to pressure the council in to using
Microsoft products (note that there is no evidence of a kick-back scheme
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-pay-25m-to-doj-and-sec-in-hungary-bribery-case/">like practiced by Microsoft Hungary</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200506-01.en.html">this decision has now been reversed</a>, and LiMux 
development and roll-out will continue.</p>

<h2 id="other-cities">Other cities</h2>

<p>Munich is not the only city choosing Free Software solutions, many
others are beginning to see the potential benefits too. In Catalonia,
Barcelona’s <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/es/transformacion-digital/tecnologia-para-un-gobierno-mejor/software-libre">Digital Transformation programme supports Free Software</a>.
From first-hand experience this means that the government transport /
road organisation use LibreOffice for all documents - so local driving
schools, etc. do not need a copy of Microsoft Office to handle the
necessary digital paperwork.</p>

<p>In Valencia, <a href="https://www.muylinux.com/2013/08/22/generalitat-valenciana-libreoffice/">the local government migrated its administration and
schools to LibreOffice</a>
saving 1.5 million euros per year, and saving students and other
end-users from having to purchase their own copies of Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>However, it is not always straightforward. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/737818/">Munich faced a lot of push-back in some areas</a>, and the <a href="https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/politica/colau-gasta-4-5-millones-en-microsoft-mientras-promete-software-libre_32165_102.html">city of Barcelona still pays almost 5 million
euros</a>
in license costs to Microsoft.</p>

<p>The main issue here is not so much the direct cost to the city itself
(which is substantial, but not critical compared to other costs -
especially since any migration will incur a significant short-term
cost), but more that the cost must be paid over and over again by all
users separately. Barcelona continues to pay millions to Microsoft every
year, but so will other cities in Spain and across Europe, and then so will all
users of those services that may have to use a copy of Microsoft Office for
compatibility reasons (i.e. students and small businesses).</p>

<p>The same cost is paid over and over again to a foreign company that will
not hire local developers or invest in the local economy, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft#Vendor_lock-in">uses vendor lock-in</a>
to eventually control all of the critical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-foss">Benefits of FOSS</h2>

<p>The most commonly cited benefit of Free Software is certainly the cost
savings vs. proprietary licensing. Whilst this can be a benefit
in some circumstances, I think it overlooks many greater far-reaching
benefits, and may not actually manifest itself in the short-term due to
the additional costs of the actual migration (i.e. costs of deployment
and training).</p>

<h3 id="shared-investment">Shared investment</h3>

<p>The main benefit of using FOSS solutions is that any investment in the
development and improvement of the software also benefits all other
users of the software.</p>

<p>That is, whilst the city of Munich might need <a href="https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux">some improvements in
handling templates</a>, other cities
might need other improvements - however they can all benefit from
each others’ investment, with no need to pay again just to keep a license.</p>

<p>This helps to build up a commonwealth of high-quality, well-maintained
software which anyone can use. There is no central, unique
owner of the projects (any project could be forked if necessary), so
there is no company that can demand payments just to allow you to keep using the
existing software.</p>

<p>Any investment in development made is truly an investment, leading directly
to project improvements, rather than just money sent to a foreign
company whilst the customers have no ownership of the actual product,
allowing the company to charge even more in the future just for the
right to keep using it (usually this is done by giving discounts for the
early migration which then result in higher prices later once the
customer is locked in).</p>

<p>Note that this initial investment might be higher than the current costs
of existing proprietary software licensing, when considering the
migration and training costs and possible development costs. However,
unlike those licensing costs it is a one-time cost, and the customer
retains some ownership over the resulting product (i.e. there is not a
license that can be revoked).</p>

<h3 id="freedom-for-development">Freedom for development</h3>

<p>There is also more freedom in the development process. The fact that the
products aren’t owned by a company means that contributions can be made
by anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Users of the software (such as the cities mentioned above) could fund
<a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops">local co-operatives of developers</a> to add desired features and maintain
the projects, instead of being forced to fund a foreign corporation with
no local investment.</p>

<p>In the long-term this might also help to break up some of the monopolistic
Big Tech companies, and result in a freer society and business
environment for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="national-security">National security</h3>

<p>In Europe especially, the current dependence on proprietary software
often means a dependence on foreign corporations which operate in
co-operation with their country’s intelligence service. As revealed by
Edward Snowden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">Microsoft provided backdoor access to encrypted messages</a> to
the NSA, CIA and FBI as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM programme</a>.</p>

<p>It is indefensible that such a company can run the critical infrastructure
of the vast majority of local and central government administrations, as
well as personal computers. Especially when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel">NSA has been proven to
intercept communications of supposedly allied nations</a>.</p>

<p>With FOSS software there is no central company to be pressured by
intelligence services or build in backdoors. All of the code can be
scrutinised by developers and users. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s Law</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same concept applies to introducing backdoors to access private data. It
might be possible to pressure or bribe one company to do so, but it
isn’t possible to do the same to tens of thousands of independent users and
developers.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture">Bigger picture</h2>

<p>The effects of co-ordinated FOSS adoption are much more far-reaching and
positive than solely saving the costs of current software licenses.</p>

<p>The adoption of FOSS and investment by many governments (at all levels)
would help to create a commonwealth of quality Free Software for all
citizens and government bodies to benefit from.</p>

<p>It would also allow development of these projects to be done from
anywhere, allowing users to fund local developers or co-operatives. This
would help to break up the massive, monopolistic Big Tech companies, and
could also be used as a way of bringing investment and jobs to parts of
the country/region that require it.</p>

<p>This would also be highly beneficial to developers, as they would have
more control over their own work (as they are not tied to the few
employers that own these popular products), and would also likely be
able to negotiate a larger portion of the compensation directly since
there would not be the overhead of salespeople and lawyers, etc. present in
current large software companies.</p>

<p>All Free Software users would benefit from the greater usage and
investment - GNU/Linux users could expect better hardware support for
example, as it becomes more commonplace.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h2>

<p>Whilst the benefits of adopting FOSS are clear, the cases in Munich and
Hungary show that it will not be an easy path to greater adoption. We
cannot just rely on central government eventually carry out the adoption
as the few representatives are easily pressured by the beneficiaries of
the status quo, and are serving a much larger political platform.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the solution lies in applying “Linus’s Law” to
politics itself. It is no coincidence that the successes in FOSS
adoption so far have been concentrated in local government - in specific
city councils and regional administrations, because it is easier for
engaged groups of citizens to have a direct effect in local government.</p>

<p>At a national level, it might be possible for a large software company
to pressure a few political leaders and policy makers, however, it is
much harder to do the same to a whole board of a dozen or more local
councillors (especially across the multitude of different counties and
regional administrations). There is “safety in numbers” as it becomes
unfeasible to pressure and manipulate large groups of
politically-engaged citizens.</p>

<p>It it is the responsibility of every citizen in a democratic society not
only to inform themselves and vote in national elections, but also to really partake in the
political system: by joining a political party, taking part in local and
regional elections, and ensuring that the democratic standards are
upheld both inside the party and in political institutions.</p>

<p>This should have support from across the political spectrum, as
guaranteeing the security and privacy of citizens’ data whilst also
cutting out the middlemen of massive foreign corporations, shouldn’t be
a controversial policy.</p>

<p>Efforts in local politics have already proven successful, such as the
LiMux project and others mentioned previously. So if you agree with the
points raised here I hope you will join whichever local political party
you agree most with, and help to bring about FOSS adoption by your
government.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Greater FOSS adoption by our governments benefits the administrations
themselves by being free …</p></div></div>

September 13, 2020 | https://filingdb.com/b/pdf-text-extraction | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://filingdb.com/b/pdf-text-extraction">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>There is a common view that extracting text from a PDF document should not be too difficult. After all, the text is right there in front of our eyes and humans consume PDF content all the time with great success. Why would it be difficult to automatically extract the text data? </p><p>Turns out, much how <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">working with human names is difficult</a> due to numerous edge cases and incorrect assumptions, working with PDFs is difficult due to the extreme flexibility given by the PDF format.</p><p>The main problem is that PDF was never really designed as a data input format, but rather, it was designed as an output format giving fine grained control over the resulting document.</p><p>At its core, the PDF format consists of a stream of instructions describing how to draw on a page. In particular, text data isn’t stored as paragraphs - or even words - but as characters which are painted at certain locations on the page. As a result, most of the content semantics are lost when a text or word document is converted to PDF - all the implied text structure is converted into an almost amorphous soup of characters floating on pages.</p><p>As part of building <a href="https://www.filingdb.com/">FilingDB</a>, we’ve extracted text data from tens of thousands of PDF documents. In the process, we have seen how every single assumption we had about how PDF files are structured was proven incorrect. Our mission was particularly difficult as we had to process PDF documents coming from a variety of sources, with wildly different styling, typesetting and presentation choices.</p><p>The list below documents some of the ways PDF files have made it difficult (or even impossible) to extract text contents.</p><h2>PDF read protection</h2><p>You may have come across PDF files which refuse to let you copy their text content. For example, here is what SumatraPDF shows when attempting to copy text from a copy-protected document.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tCFgGsFAVfhZQqJx.png" alt="copy denied.png"></p><p>Interestingly, the text is already visible, yet the PDF viewer is refusing to populate the clipboard with the highlighted text.</p><p>The way this is implemented is by having several “access permissions” flags, one of which controls whether copying content is allowed. It’s important to keep in mind that this restriction is not enforced by the PDF file - the actual PDF contents are unaffected and it is up to the pdf renderer to honour this flag.</p><p>Needless to say, this offers no real protection against extracting the text out of the PDF, as any reasonably sophisticated PDF handling library will allow the user to either toggle the flags or ignore them.</p><h2>Off-page characters</h2><p>It is not uncommon for PDF files to contain more textual data than is actually displayed on the page. Take this page from the 2010 Nestle annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/rWwxfWHHBcjvZQul.png" alt="Nestle hidden text.png"></p><p>There is more text associated with this page than meets the eye. In particular, the following can be found in the content data associated with this page:</p><blockquote>“KitKat celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010 but remains young and in touch with trends, having over 2.5 million Facebook fans. It is sold in over 70 countries and enjoys good growth in the developed world and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, India and Russia. Japan is its second biggest market.”</blockquote><p>This text is actually positioned outside the page’s bounding box, so it is not displayed by most PDF viewers, but the data is there and will appear when programmatically extracting the text.</p><p>This occasionally happens due to last minute decisions to remove or replace text during the type setting process.</p><h2>Small / invisible characters on page</h2><p>PDFs occasionally introduce very small or hidden text on the page. For example, here is a page from the Nestle 2012 annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kqduhxcugDRKTbDC.png" alt="hidden characters.png"></p><p>The page contains small white text on white background with the following contents:</p><blockquote>​“Wyeth Nutrition logo Identity Guidance to markets</blockquote><blockquote>Vevey Octobre 2012 RCC/CI&amp;D”</blockquote><p>This is sometimes done for the benefit of accessibility, similar to how the alt attribute is used in HTML.</p><h2>​Too many spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs include extra spaces between letters in a word. This is most likely done for kerning purposes. (“Kerning” is the process of adjusting distances between characters during the type setting process)</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: the 2013 Hikma Pharma annual report contains the following text:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LNAUhbShXUkPbOhc.png" alt="an_excellent.PNG"></p><p>Copying the text gives:</p><blockquote>“ch a i r m a n ' s s tat em en t”</blockquote><p>Reconstructing the original text is a difficult problem to solve generally. Our most successful approach has been applying OCR techniques.</p><h2>Not enough spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs do not contain spaces or replace them with a different character.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: The following extract from the 2017 SEB annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/byRVQrWFscgwqUbM.png" alt="global trends.PNG"></p><p>The extracted text shows:</p><blockquote>“Tenyearsafterthefinancialcrisisstarted”</blockquote><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: The 2013 Eurobank annual report shows the following</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/cNjRRWVALUGfSnRl.png" alt="eurobank.PNG"></p><p>Extracting the text gives:</p><blockquote>“On_April_7,_2013,_the_competent_authorities”</blockquote><p>Again, our most successful solution was to run OCR on these pages.</p><h2>Embedded fonts</h2><p>PDF font handling is complex to say the least. To understand how PDF files store text data we must first know about glyphs, glyph names, fonts.</p><ul><li>A glyph is a set of instructions describing how to draw a symbol or character.</li><li>A glyph name is the name associated with that glyph. For example “trademark” for the “™” glyph and “a” for the “a” glyph.</li><li>Fonts are lists of glyphs with associated glyph names. For example, most fonts have a glyph that most humans would recognize as the letter “a”, with different fonts showing various ways of drawing that letter.</li></ul><p>In a PDF, the characters are stored as numbers, called “codepoints”. To decide what to draw on the screen, a renderer has to go:</p><p><code>codepoint -&gt; glyph name -&gt; glyph</code></p><p>For example, a PDF document can contain codepoint 116, which it maps into the glyph name “<code>t</code>” which, in turn, maps into the glyph describing how to draw “<code>t</code>” on the screen.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/boPNiRoKrNIlOHHD.png" alt="unicode glyphs.png"></p><p>Now, most PDF files use a standard codepoint encoding. A codepoint encoding is a set of rules that assign meaning to the codepoints themselves. For example:</p><ul><li>ASCII and Unicode both use codepoint 116 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”.</li><li>Unicode maps codepoint 9786 to “<code>white smiley face</code>”, rendered as ☺, whereas ASCII is not defined at that codepoint. </li></ul><p>However, PDF documents occasionally use their own custom encoding together with custom fonts. It might seem strange, but a document can use codepoint 1 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”. It will map codepoint 1 into the glyph name “<code>c1</code>”, which will map into a glyph describing how to draw the letter “<code>t</code>”.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/oLGIEmjOegjUtsiQ.png" alt="custom glyphs.png"></p><p>While for a human the end result looks the same, a machine will get confused by the codepoints it is seeing. If the codepoints do not follow a standard encoding, then it is virtually impossible to programmatically know what codepoints 1, 2 and 3 represent.</p><p>Why would a PDF document contain nonstandard fonts and encodings?</p><ul><li>One reason is to make text extraction more difficult.</li><li>Another is the use of subfonts. Most fonts contain glyphs for a very large number of codepoints and a pdf might only use a subset of these. To save space, a PDF creator can strip away all unneeded glyphs and create a compact subfont which will most likely use a non-standard encoding.</li></ul><p>One workaround is to extract the font glyphs from the document, run them through OCR software and build the map from font glyph to unicode. This then lets you translate from the font-specific encoding to the unicode encoding e.g: codepoint 1 is mapped to name “<code>c1</code>” which, based on looking at the glyph, should be a “<code>t</code>”, which is unicode codepoint 116.</p><p>The encoding map that you’ve just generated, the one going from 1 to 116, is called a ToUnicode map in the PDF standard. PDF documents can provide their own ToUnicode map, but it’s optional and many do not.</p><h2>Word and paragraph detection</h2><p>Reconstructing paragraphs and even words from the amorphous character soup of PDF files is a difficult task.</p><p>The PDF document provides a list of characters on a page and it is up to the consumer to identify words and paragraphs. Humans are naturally effective at doing this as reading is a widespread skill.</p><p>The common approach is to have a grouping or clustering algorithm which compares letter sizes, positions and alignments in order to determine what is a word/paragraph.</p><p>Naive implementations can easily have complexity larger than O(n²), resulting in long processing times on busy pages.</p><h2>Text and paragraph order</h2><p>Deciding on text and paragraph order is difficult on two levels.</p><p>First, sometimes there is no correct answer. While documents with conventional, single column typesetting have a natural order of reading, documents with more adventurous layouts are challenging. As an example, it is not clear if the following inset should appear before, after, or during the article it is placed next to:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tdNisrVDTpYeRiVU.png" alt="paragraph order.PNG"></p><p>Second, even when the answer is clear to a human, determining robust paragraph order is a very difficult problem to solve, perhaps even AI-hard. This might sound like an extreme statement, however there are cases where the correct paragraph order can only be decided by understanding the text content.</p><p>Consider the following two-columns layout, describing how to prepare a vegetable salad:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LVpxBZtdQdXIYMfv.png" alt="recipe.png"></p><p>In the western world, a reasonable assumption is that reading is done left to right and top to bottom. So the best we can do without looking at the contents is to reduce the answer to 2 options: A B C D and A C B D.</p><p>By looking at the content, understanding what it is talking about and knowing that vegetables are washed before chopping, we can determine that A C B D is the correct order. Determining this algorithmically is a difficult problem.</p><p>That being said, a “works most times” approach is to rely on the order in which the text is stored inside the PDF document. This usually corresponds to the order the text was inserted at creation time and, for large bodies of text containing multiple paragraphs, they tend to reflect the writer-intended order.</p><h2>Embedded images</h2><p>It is not uncommon for some (or all) of the PDF content to actually be a scan. In these cases, there is no text data to extract directly, so we have to resort to OCR techniques.</p><p>As an example, the Yell 2011 annual report is only available as a document scan:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kMKEqcgsWNHNhiXI.png" alt="scan.PNG"></p><h2>Why not OCR all …</h2></div></div></div></div>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><del>The Nokia 3310 3G is a</del> <em>Some versions</em> of the Nokia 3310 3G works as a descent podcast player, but you have to manage
your podcasts on a real computer.</p>
<h2>The story about why I bought candy bar feature phone in 2020</h2>
<p>Nokia 3310 3G is a feature phone with at least a design
heritage from the much loved Nokia 3310 of the late nineties.
A feature phone in 2020 is maybe not as strange as it might seem.
While the smart-phones are getting ever more advanced, there is also
a counter trend of digital decluttering.</p>
<p>I used to love my smartphone. I was on reddit (back when the mobile website worked)
and youtube all the time on my phone. I use it as a music player while I'm doing kitchen stuff.</p>
<p>But the main use was as a podcast player. Pre-corona I had a commute of
about an hour in each direction (bike + bus). I spent most of the bike time
with podcasts in my ear (the bus time was spent on hobby programming projects).</p>
<p>In January of 2020 I went on paternal leave and the podcast time picked up
significantly as I spent the days lugging around my sleeping then 7 months old boy
while walking the 8 months old lab. I would get about 10 hours of battery time out of
my phone, a 2016 model of Samsung A3. Now, clearly the battery had seen better
days. And it was never a high end phone to begin with. But 10 hours battery time
was getting to be a stress factor.</p>
<p>The thing is I sort of have to have a smartphone. Swish payments is one factor.
Most things that used to be actual currency transactions is Swish payments now.
Buy meat from the cattle farmer? Swish. Buy honey from the beekeeper? Swish. Buy socks
to support your coworkers kids soccer team? Swish. And Swish is available on phones only.
The chromebook that I use for mostly everything can run Android apps but the Swish app
refuses to install on a non phone device.</p>
<p>Another factor is BankID. BankID used to be only a bank issued smart card and a special
little card reader. You would stick the card into a slot in the reader and enter your pin
on the readers keypad. To log into you bank or to a government service you would get a 9 digit
code from the website that you would enter into the reader. The BankID reader would then display
a 6 digit answer code that you would enter into the website and the BankID system would then
guarantee your identity to the bank or government service. But then Mobile Bank Id showed up.
It's a smartphone app that does the same thing except the code-answer code exchange is done
automatically without user interaction now. And lots of websites are starting to retire
the old reader way identifying yourself, leaving Mobile BankID with the only option.</p>
<p>Being on paternal leave I did not have the money for a brand new smartphone, other than one
really low end one. It was also clear to me that it was the podcast consumption that was eating
up my battery. The days that I didn't listen to podcast I would get 24 hour of battery or more.
I'm not sure why podcasts in particular are so hard on the battery, it seemed that about equal
time on Spotify would not drain it nearly as much. I suspect that the fact that the podcast files
are stored on a external SD card has something to do with it.</p>
<p>I started looking at buying dedicated MP3 player. I know from buying an mp3 player for my oldest
daughter that the cheap ones are shit for podcasts and audio books. They reset the play list when
you turn them off and there is no way to have them turned on all the time. They power down when
taking a charge. San-disk still makes an mp3 player that are good for podcast and audio books.
"Resume function" is the keyword to look for. Roxcore also has one (I got one for my daughter when
the <em>really</em> cheap one turned our to be shit).</p>
<p>But then I saw the Nokia 3310 phones. At 600 SEK it's about the same price as a Roxcore mp3 player.
So I started to think I would get one and use it as an mp3 player <em>and</em> have it double as a backup
phone in case my smartphone had drained it's battery. But I was a bit hesitant, because I couldn't get
good information on weather the 3310 did the resume thing or not.</p>
<p>Eventually I bought one anyway. And I bought a 32 GB micro SD for it to store podcasts.
The 3310 has apps but no app store. You supposedly <em>can</em> download java apps for the Java Micro
framework or whatever its called and run them on the phone. But I haven't bothered. The phone has a
music player that picks up any mp3 file stored in the "Music" folder on the SD card, or the phone itself.
The music player really likes those mp3 tags for sorting the music by artist and albums, so it's not ideal
for podcasts. As a last ditch it sorts the files by name, so it kind of works out anyway. And yes, it does
"resume". Even if you exit the music player app it resumes where you stopped. And I get 4 to 5 days of battery
time even with rather heavy use. My old Samsung spends most of it's time in my bag now, and when not used, that
thing has pretty fantastic battery time too.</p>
<p>I use GPodder on windows to manage podcast downloads as the phone cant handle downloads.
It's pretty OK. I don't use the sync feature though, I just let it download everything,
and then I pick and choose what to transfer to the phone.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>I got a mail from <a href="http://ibawizard.net/">Jakub</a> where he wondered how I got the "resume" function
to work. He also has a 3310 (model of 2018), and apparently <em>his</em> phone does not resume anything,
but instead resets the player even on "stop". My phone has software version 30.0.0.17.03 (no build date), his phone
has software version V11.02.11, build date 2017-04-26. You can get the software version by dialing *#0000#
Since the version is completely differently formatted, I suspect that it's a different OS altogether.</p>
<p>So be careful I guess, some phones with earlier software may not work as a podcast player. My advice is do buy
from a bricks-and-mortar store and check the software version before you give them your money.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Jugaad is an attitude towards delivery which originated in India and consists of three simple tenets:</p>



<ul><li>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</li><li>Openness: keep your options open</li><li>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</li></ul>



<p>Jugaad is agility taken to the extreme and most suitable for projects with a high degree of change, risk and uncertainty. Nothing demonstrates the essence of jugaad better than the homonymous improvised vehicles built in India. All essential mechanical parts lay open and are easily accessible instead of being enclosed in casings. The vehicle can be assembled from commonly available, repurposed parts. It can be customised and extended to fit a variety of personal and professional needs, workloads and environments. The choice of parts can adapt the jugaad vehicle to different types of terrain, usage, fuel and availability of parts.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p>This post is not the result of studying literature, most of which seems to have been written around the peek of the jugaad hype in 2010. It rather distils the experience of a decade working with delivery teams in India, what I learned from their approach to delivery and from being immersed in Indian corporate culture. Through large parts of this post it may seem that I advocate the adoption of jugaad and the abolition of other agile methods; the opposite is true – I will try to make the point that the wholistic approach of jugaad to solution design should be paired with the tactical discipline of a framework like agile or XP.</p>



<h2>The tenets work together</h2>



<p>The three tenets (Humility, Openness, Frugality) complement and contradict each other in a beautiful way: Humility <em>generates</em> options for a solution, openness <em>guides</em> and <em>combines</em> them and frugality <em>eliminates</em> them. Only solutions adhering to all three tenets are built in the jugaad spirit.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1741" data-permalink="https://blog.georgovassilis.com/options/" data-orig-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png" data-orig-size="607,165" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="options" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=607" src="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=607" alt="" srcset="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png 607w, https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=150 150w, https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"><figcaption>Tenets refine options</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</h2>



<p>Delivery methods like Waterfall, Scrum and XP wage religious wars over definitions (eg. what is the right sprint length?), processes (eg. degree of upfront planning), skills (eg. which framework should we use) and tools (eg. Maven or Gradle) all of which are more or less derivatives of adherence to a method. Jugaad replaces those definitions, processes, skills and tools with a central guidance: <em>be conscious about the shortcuts taken</em> with respect to the two other tenets. Jugaad frequently comes with a high degree of “out of the box” thinking and requires, for it to work, the humility to let go of technical and methodological preconceptions about what is the “appropriate” way and focus solely on the result.</p>



<p>Humility is the starting point in jugaad in that using “whatever works” generates a plethora of options. So how do we choose amongst these options? That is where Openness takes over.</p>



<h2>Openness: keep your options open</h2>



<p>The ostensible carelessness with which jugaad approaches delivery is built on the solid foundation of Openness. Whatever we build should be easy to extend, change or reverse. Openness often lacks elegance and conciseness, the inner workings of things are exposed, there is not much polish and one can see the parts a solution is made of – not to mention the security concerns arising from such solution. Just think of the jugaad vehicle we talked about earlier if you need a mental picture. But those trade-offs enable easily modifiable solutions and are exactly that: conscious trade-offs, not shortcomings. A solution which is open to change is a solid project or product foundation as it can adapt to unforeseen changes and doesn’t require much up-front design. Openness takes Humility’s options and guides them into coherent patterns. Not all options will form a good solution and not all combinations of options will work; Openness tells us which of them <em>might</em> work without losing an arm and a leg in the process of finding out.</p>



<h2>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</h2>



<p>Frugality is about risk management: reducing upfront costs <em>now </em>allows exploring more value propositions and solution approaches <em>now</em> while spending resources <em>later</em> on improving the solution. A low cost incurred early jeopardises a project less than a large cost incurred at the same time, especially if whatever that cost bought us turned out to be the wrong thing. Frugality is a holistic view on the patterns guided by Openness – it takes into consideration synergies between options and maximises value, both in terms of business value created for the solution (how many of the requirements were implemented at what effort) as well as value added to the project delivery (how much delivery and quality was improved, what was learned etc).</p>



<h2>Comparison by example</h2>



<p>Jugaad is illustrated best with a couple of examples which contrast traditional, “proper” design with improvised jugaad design.</p>



<h3>Example: receipt system</h3>



<p>Design a system that generates, stores and sends receipts via email to customers. Customer support should be able to retrieve receipts.</p>



<p>The traditional, “proper” solution:  we program a system that stores receipts in a relational database, generates receipt PDFs, stores those PDFs in the database, sends the PDFs to customers. We program a web interface for use by customer service which can query the database for receipts.</p>

<p>The jugaad-engineered solution: we program a system that generates HTML receipts, emails them to customers and BCCs a customer support email account with the same receipt. Customer support can use their email client to retrieve receipts. These components are either packaged and require no development effort (Customer support E-Mail client, E-Mail server), there a only few components and they are easy to implement.</p>

<p>Let’s evaluate the jugaad-engineered solution against jugaad’s tenets and compare it with the “traditional” solution.</p>



<p>Humility: the design relies on packaged components which probably already exist and it only minimally invades the existing IT landscape. It reuses high quality packaged solutions (e-mail server, e-mail client) which may already exist in the organisation and reduces implementation tasks to e-mail server and e-mail client configurations. The traditional delivery method places several requirements on how the solution is built: it mandates formal APIs, probably a particular technology platform, a pre-defined method according to which components are structured (eg. SOLID), technical documentation and thorough test automation long before it is clear that the project will make it into production, but nevertheless increasing conceptional and real complexity of the solution and the delivery process and requiring an increased skill set for project participants. </p>



<p>Openness: the e-mail protocols between the application, e-mail servers and e-mail clients are well understood and extensible. Using E-Mail clients requires low to no training and the IT department probably maintains them already. The components themselves can be substituted without affecting much the rest of the solution; eg. a new field can be added to future receipts without modifying already issued receipts. Because many components can be operated by human agents (the e-mail server and e-mail clients), many new features and workarounds can be implemented as manual processes before coding and automating them into software. Since not much effort has been put at the initial stage into upfront design there isn’t much effort wasted when requirements change and implementations follow.</p>



<p>Frugality: the use of packaged components, especially when they are already familiar, reduces implementation effort and speeds up delivery at the cost of the finished product showing incongruities where different components interface.  New requirements needing larger changes can be implemented by exchanging existing components for components better fitting the requirements or even rewriting them from scratch, if needed. In many cases the early progress made thanks to the low initial effort should more than make up for the higher, later cost. The traditional solution contrasts badly with jugaad in terms of effort. For example, it will mandate a particular API design such as a REST API for the receipt generator and receipt retrieval or even a REST API between the receipt generator and the email server, because… principles. Technical documentation will be written for the components long before it is clear that the project will ever go live, not considering that any effort spent on non-value adding features jeopardises a go-live. And last not least unit tests will be written to achieve an arbitrarily agreed upon test coverage before it is clear that they generate business value eg. by catching regressions. The jugaad-engineered solution will produce formal APIs, documentation and test automation when their added value outweighs the implementation effort.</p>



<h2>Contrast with agile</h2>



<p>Jugaad has no processes like Scrum or XP. It talks about the values worth striving for. It doesn’t talk about velocity or quality; even the focus on low cost introduces the discipline to achieving openness, thus being able to revisit a previously built solution. Agile highlights <em>reactiveness</em>, it’s main point being the ability to react to unforeseen changes, but it uses a predefined process such as Scrum or Kanban. The process must adapt to organisational changes or changing skill sets. Jugaad does not dictate any delivery process, so in a way it is orthogonal to existing agile practices. By adding formalised steps to it, a mature jugaad practice may evolve into Scrum or Kanban if that seems useful.</p>



<p>But jugaad is not about agile without …</p></div></div>

                    <p>James A. Bashford and colleagues <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425399/"><strong>aimed to identify a novel quantitative biomarker related to fasciculations</strong></a> that could monitor patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis over time.</p>

<p>Fasciculations are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Their presence precedes the onset of muscle weakness. However benign fasciculation syndrome is not considered a prodrome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p>The authors have recently developed Surface Potential Quantification Engine (SPiQE), which is an automated analytical tool designed to detect and characterize fasciculation potentials from resting high-density surface electromyography. SPiQE is capable of analysing 30-min recordings, producing simple outputs related to fasciculation frequency, amplitude, inter-fasciculation intervals and data quality. SPiQE’s analytical pipeline achieved a classification accuracy of 88% when applied to 5318 fasciculation potentials that had been identified manually.</p>

<p><img src="https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/img/Hand_Motor_Units_web.jpg" width="400">

<p>A motor unit comprises the motor neuron cell body, axon, terminal branches and connecting muscle fibres. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis leads to a process called chronic partial denervation. This means that as motor units succumb to the disease and die, surviving motor units are instructed to sprout and branch to reinnervate orphaned muscles fibres.</p>

<p>This is an evolutionary, compensatory mechanism designed to maintain muscle power in the face of a reduced motor unit pool. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a reinnervating motor unit steadily acquires new muscle fibres and consequently produces motor unit action potentials of larger amplitude, longer duration and greater complexity.</p>

<p>However, due to the relentless loss of motor units in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, this process of reinnervation cannot maintain muscle strength indefinitely. A saturation point is reached and muscle fibres consequently atrophy, leading swiftly to clinical weakness. By assessing fasciculation amplitude serially as a surrogate of this reinnervation process, the scientists hoped to gain insight into this process.</p>

<p>It had been suggested that motor unit firing pattern is evidence for motoneuronal or axonal fasciculations; namely interspike intervals of approximately 5&nbsp;ms (doublet intervals) provide evidence for the axonal firing. Fasciculation doublets have been shown to occur in biceps brachii, vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as the gastrocnemius (along with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle) from both patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign fasciculation syndrome.</p>

<p>Fasciculation doublets are defined as the occurrence of two almost identical motor unit potentials, presumed to both arise from the same motor unit, with a very short IFI of &lt;100 ms. Shorter inter-fasciculation intervals (5–10 ms) are likely to arise distally in the terminal branches, whereas longer inter-fasciculation intervals (40–80 ms) are thought to originate proximally at the soma.</p>

<p>Faced with the low occurrence rate of doublets during electrical stimulation, the scientists hypothesized that collection of vast numbers of fasciculations would be required to observe IFI peaks in these ranges. In turn, this might help to elucidate the origin of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p>So in this study, Bashford and colleagues compared amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with control subjects who have benign fasciculation syndrome, a condition that is defined by the isolated presence of fasciculations, particularly in muscles of the lower limbs, without evidence of underlying motor neuron degeneration</p>

<p>Twenty patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and five patients with benign fasciculation syndrome each underwent up to seven assessments at intervals of 2 months 
A total of 420 (210 biceps, 210 gastrocnemius) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 116 (58 biceps, 58 gastrocnemius) benign fasciculation syndrome recordings were analyzed. Ten biceps recordings from two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were excluded due to contamination from a Parkinsonian resting tremor</p>

<p>The scientists tested whether the presence of muscle weakness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis influenced the change in fasciculation frequency over time. The scientists divided the data into strong and weak muscles. The scientists divided each muscle into pre-weakness, peri-weakness and post-weakness groups. This allowed them to assess the chronology of disease by equating these groups to early, middle and late stages of disease, respectively. This was only possible due to the anatomical specificity of the high-density surface electromyography technique, which is a major strength in this setting.</p>

<p>For biceps, fasciculation frequency in strong amyotrophic lateral sclerosis muscles was 10× greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline, while fasciculation frequency in weak muscles started at levels 40× greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline. Over the 14 months of the study, fasciculation frequency decreased in weak muscles at a rate three times faster than average. This supported the suspicion of the authors that biceps fasciculation frequency was non-linear, first rising steadily from a pre-morbid baseline in strong muscles and subsequently falling as weakness ensued.</p>

<p>Given that there was no significant change in biceps fasciculation frequency over the 14 months of the study in strong amyotrophic lateral sclerosis muscles, Bashford and colleagues hypothesize that the rising phase is slow, perhaps starting many years before clinical weakness. In contrast to biceps, gastrocnemius demonstrated a significant decline in fasciculation frequency in strong muscles, but plateaued in weak muscles.</p>

<p>The most striking implication from these results was the rise and subsequent fall of fasciculation frequency in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis biceps muscles. This non-linear pattern had been previously suggested after statistically modelling fasciculation counts using muscle ultrasound and might explain why a previous surface EMG study of fasciculation frequency did not show a significant linear change over time.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesize that the two main contributing factors to fasciculation frequency are the size of the affected motor unit pool and the relative degree of hyperexcitability. The size of the viable motor unit pool declines over time in biceps muscles, even while muscles remained strong (albeit at a slower rate than weak muscles). 
However, it remains unknown what proportion of motor units are affected (and therefore hyperexcitable) at a given stage of the disease.</p>

<p>The decline in fasciculation frequency can be attributed to the relentlessly shrinking motor unit pool. The picture above highlight the proposed model of the interactions between muscle power, size of viable motor unit pool (as assessed by MUNIX) and fasciculation frequency in benign fasciculation syndrome and three stages of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425399/bin/EMS94304-f006.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>The diagrams depict the dynamic changes in motor unit architecture and relative hyperexcitability (depicted by electric bolts) as a consequence of motor neuron degeneration and motor unit loss.</p>

<p>In benign fasciculation syndrome, there is global hyperexcitability affecting all motor units to a similar degree in the absence of motor neuron degeneration.</p>

<p>In early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a subset of motor units are hyperexcitable, motor unit loss has begun and mild–moderate compensatory reinnervation has occurred. Due to the stability of biceps fasciculation frequency in strong muscles over 14 months (at a firing rate ~10 greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline), the rising phase is hypothesized to begin many years before muscle weakness first appears.</p>

<p>It is postulated that towards the latter end of the rising phase, the rate of increase in fasciculation frequency speeds up, so that by the onset of weakness, fasciculation frequency is ~40 the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline.</p>

<p>In the middle stage, the ongoing loss of motor units has promoted extensive re-innervation of surviving motor units, which then become hyperexcitable themselves. This compensatory mechanism leads to fasciculations of greater amplitude and allows muscles to remain strong by staving off muscular atrophy.</p>

<p>However, as a tipping point is reached, these compensatory mechanisms saturate, leading to the onset of muscle atrophy and weakness.</p>

<p>In late amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the death of the most re-innervated motor units leads to worsening muscle atrophy and weakness. The relentless loss of motor units drives the falling fasciculation frequency. Evidence of doublets with inter-fasciculation intervals in the 20–80 ms range is consistent with the period of motor unit subtypes (fast-slow), supporting a proximal origin of fasciculations at the soma. Throughout all stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in benign fasciculation syndrome, the degree of hyperexcitability of the lower motor neuron is likely to be driven and/or influenced by descending corticospinal inputs.</p>

      <p>One of the <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/questions">Collison questions</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is Bloom's "Two Sigma" phenomenon real? If so, what do we do about it?</strong></p>
<p>Educational psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bloom">Benjamin Bloom</a> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf">found</a> that one-on-one tutoring using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a> led to a <em>two sigma</em>(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?</p>
<p>In a related vein, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919">this large-scale meta-analysis</a> shows large (&gt;0.5 <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d">Cohen's d</a>) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Answering the question requires first to explain what <em>Direct Instruction</em> and <em>Mastery Learning</em> mean.</p>
<h3 id="scope-of-the-present-article">Scope of the present article</h3>
<p>This article is concerned with a general study of Bloom's two sigma problem, which in turn involves an examination of an educational method, mastery learning, and tutoring. I have also included a review of software-based tutoring. Later on I look at educational research in general, spaced repetition, and deliberate practice, as these seem closely related to the core topics of this review for reasons that will be obvious after reading through it.</p>
<p>I am only concerned here with student performance in tests, not with other putative benefits from education; I don't look in detail at what keeps students motivated, what makes them feel well, what makes them more creative, or better citizens.. I could have looked at longer term measures of success (e.g. income later on in life) but I couldn't find such studies.</p>
<p>As a general note, when discussing effect sizes here,  unless otherwise noted, the effect sizes are of the intervention being discussed vs business as usual, using whatever educational method the school was using.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<h4 id="the-two-sigma-problem">The Two Sigma problem</h4>
<p>Benjamin Bloom, decades ago, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf">found</a> that individual tutoring raised student's performance relative to a baseline class by two standard deviations, which is a MASSIVE<sup><a href="#massive">1</a></sup> effect. As 1:1 tutoring is very expensive, he wondered if there are approaches that approximate such an effect that were applicable for larger classrooms. Finding such a method was the "two sigma problem". And Mastery Learning seemed to be the promising way to solve it.</p>
<p><img src="https://nintil.com/images/2019-07-03-bloom-sigma/bloom.png" alt="Image result for bloom two sigma"></p>
<h4 id="direct-instruction">Direct Instruction</h4>
<p>From the meta-analysis cited above, Direct Instruction is a teaching program originally developed by Siegfried Engelmann in the 60s that assumes that any student can learn any given piece of material, and this will happen when </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) they have mastered prerequisite knowledge and skills and (b) the instruction is unambiguous. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't sound that helpful; fortunately the <a href="https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/basic-philosophy.html">National Institute for Direct Instruction</a> has a bit more information. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main features of DI that ensure students learn faster and more efficiently than any other program or technique available:</p>
<p><strong>Students are placed in instruction at their skill level.</strong> 
When students begin the program, each student is tested to find out which skills they have already mastered and which ones they need to work on. From this, students are grouped together with other students needing to work on the same skills. These groups are organized by the level of the program that is appropriate for students, rather than the grade level the students are in.</p>
<p><strong>The program’s structure is designed to ensure mastery of the content.</strong> 
The program is organized so that skills are introduced gradually, giving children a chance to learn those skills and apply them before being required to learn another new set of skills. Only 10% of each lesson is new material. The remaining 90% of each lesson’s content is review and application of skills students have already learned but need practice with in order to master. Skills and concepts are taught in isolation and then integrated with other skills into more sophisticated, higher-level applications. All details of instruction are controlled to minimize the chance of students' misinterpreting the information being taught and to maximize the reinforcing effect of instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction is modified to accommodate each student’s rate of learning.</strong> 
A particularly wonderful part about DI is that students are retaught or accelerated at the rate at which they learn. If they need more practice with a specific skill, teachers can provide the additional instruction within the program to ensure students master the skill. Conversely, if a student is easily acquiring the new skills and needs to advance to the next level, students can be moved to a new placement so that they may continue adding to the skills they already possess.</p>
<p><strong>Programs are field tested and revised before publication.</strong> 
DI programs are very unique in the way they are written and revised before publication. All DI programs are field tested with real students and revised based on those tests before they are ever published. This means that the program your student is receiving has already been proven to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct Instruction is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_teaching">highly scripted</a>, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Contemporary_Educational_Psychology/Chapter_8:_Instructional_Strategies/Mastery_Learning"><em>including even the words they should speak while teaching</em></a>.</p>
<p>Note that Direct Instruction (titlecase) is not the same as <a href="https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/di-vs-di">direct instruction</a> (lowercase), there are various programmes around that have "direct instruction" in the name, like <a href="https://dataworks-ed.com/blog/2014/07/direct-instruction-di-vs-explicit-direct-instruction-edi/">Explicit Direct Instruction</a> . Unless otherwise noted, we'll be talking about Direct Instruction in this review. Both are teacher-centered methods in that the teacher is seen as the one who is transmitting knowledge to the student rather than, say, the student being aided by the teacher in a quest to discover knowledge. Direct Instruction is regulated by the National Institute for Direct Instruction, as mentioned above, while direct instruction is not.</p>
<h4 id="mastery-learning">Mastery learning</h4>
<p>Mastery learning (ML) is not the same as Direct Instruction, but ML <em>is a component of Direct Instruction</em>. It is also one of the methods Bloom originally looked at, so we also examine ML in this review. One key difference is that ML does not called for scripted lessons, while DI requires them.</p>
<p>The key principle of ML is simply to force students to master a lesson before moving on to the next one. At the end of each lesson, on a monthly or weekly basis, students' knowledge is tested. Those students that do not pass are given remediation classes, and they have to re-sit the test until they master it. This can be done in a group setting, as with Bloom's original Learning for Mastery (LFM) programme, or individually, as in Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), where each student advances as their own pace.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The literatures examined here are full of small sample, non-randomized trials, and highly heterogeneous results.</li>
<li>Tutoring in general, most likely, does not reach the 2-sigma level that Bloom suggested. Likewise, it's unlikely that mastery learning provides a 1-sigma improvement.
<ul>
<li>But high quality tutors, and high quality software are likely able to reach a 2-sigma improvement and beyond. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the methods (mastery learning, direct instruction, tutoring, software tutoring, deliberate practice, and spaced repetition) studied in this essay are found to work to various degrees, outlined below.</li>
<li>This essay covers many kinds of subjects being taught, and likewise many groups (special education vs regular schools, college vs K-12). The effect sizes reported here are averages that serve as general guidance.</li>
<li>The methods studied tend to be more effective for lower skilled students relative to the rest.</li>
<li>The methods studied work at all levels of education, with the exception of direct instruction: There is no evidence to judge its effectiveness at the college level.</li>
<li>The methods work substantially better when clear objectives and facts to be learned are set. There is little evidence of <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/low_transfer_of.html">learning transfer</a>: Practicing or studying X subject does not improve much performance outside of X.</li>
<li>There is some suggestive evidence that the underlying reasons these methods work are increased and repeated exposure to the material, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>, and fine-grained feedback on performance in the case of tutoring.</li>
<li>Long term studies tend to find evidence of a fade-out effect, effect sizes decrease over time. This is likely due to the skills being learned not being practiced.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="effect-sizes">Effect sizes</h4>
<p>Assessing if an effect size is meaningful may be hard. A common way of doing so is as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size">follows</a>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Effect size</em></th><th><em>d</em></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Very small</td><td>0.01</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>0.20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>0.50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>0.80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very large</td><td>1.20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Huge</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>However, one should be able to finetune the descriptive language used, by using a domain-specific reference. In this case, the average effect on performance from one year of schooling  (going from 5th to 6th grade) is d=0.26 for reading performance, and the average effect from 141 large scale RCTs of educational interventions is 0.06, from  Hugues &amp; Matthew (<a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/141754/">2019</a>). Because of this, I will be using a scale adapted from Kraft (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mkraft/files/kraft_2018_interpreting_effect_sizes.pdf">2018</a>):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Effect size</em> (E.S.)</th><th><em>d</em></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>&lt;0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>0.05-0.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>0.2-0.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very large</td><td>0.5-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extremely large</td><td>1-1.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Huge</td><td>&gt;1.5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>With that in mind, here is the summary of the main results, along with the best studies I could find to back up the claims. For comparison, I include Bloom's findings:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Method</em></th><th>E.S. (general)</th><th>E.S. (disadvantaged)</th><th>E.S. (Bloom)</th><th>Key references</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Tutoring*</td><td>Very large</td><td>-</td><td>Huge</td><td>VanLehn (<a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Ekvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf">2011</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software-based tutoring (High quality)*</td><td>Very large</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>VanLehn (<a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Ekvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf">2011</a>), Kulik &amp; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654315581420">Fletcher (2016)</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mastery learning**</td><td>Medium</td><td>Large</td><td>Extremely large</td><td>Kulik et al. (<a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Egmswan3/575/kulik_kulik_Bangert-Drowns_1990.pdf">1990</a>), Slavin (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00346543057002175">1987</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direct Instruction**</td><td>Medium</td><td>Large</td><td>-</td><td>Borman et al. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00346543073002125">2003</a>), Stockard et al. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919">2018</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* With really good tutors and really good software, the effect size can indeed be Huge.</p>
<p>** When considering narrow knowledge of a series of facts, or basic skills taught at the elementary level, the effects of ML and DI can be Large for the general population and Extremely Large for disadvantaged students. </p>

The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure.

<p>I am not one to cry from reading, but I imagine many a reader would when reading of the despair of life with a young family during a famine and of what they witness. There is much more emotional engagement elsewhere in the story, whether it is the despair of poverty; the frustration of the inequities between rich and poor, men and women, workers and freeloaders; the fear of violence and disappointment in the character's choices. [...]</p>
<p>Wang has known nothing other than the hardworking, precarious, life of a peasant. The life within the House of Hwang is as alien to him as the life of a Westerner. He does not consider how different his life might have been if he had been born into privilege. Nor does he realise, since upward financial and social mobility is his dream, how, if he were to succeed, it would change the way he feels about his wife, the way he would raise his sons or the life he would choose to lead. The thought that his sons might grow up in a completely different environment to himself, with personalities, opportunities, ambitions and wants completely foreign to his own would baffle him.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being productive all the time is not just difficult, it might actually burn you out, but that being said lack of productivity for an extended period of time is dangerous too because it gives the mind an excuse to start looking at all the negative things happening in the world, especially with the global pandemic going on. </p><p>So how does one stay productive consistently? I find that the only way to be productive is through feedback. To be productive you need to receive a small but noticeable reward for attempting to be productive. If that did not make any sense, let me try and explain it with an example.</p><p><strong>Kickstarting the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I wanted to write a piece of content today because I have not written anything in a long period of time. Once this piece is out there on a few social media platforms, I might see a small but noticeable spike in the traffic to my blog which I can confirm from my good friend google analytics. This little spike in traffic is my tiny reward which will kick start a feedback loop.</p><p>Now there is higher likelihood that I will try and write some more content next week because I still remember the feeling of that reward and I want to feel it again, but the difference now is that I have built a tolerance for this reward and the only way I would feel satisfied is if I receive a higher reward which in this case might translate to a higher spike in google analytics.</p><p><strong>Add incremental steps to the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>To receive a higher reward I am now motivated to write better quality content which reaches a wider group of audience and what gets even better is if people start engaging with me after reading my post and wish to dwell further into the subject. </p><p>If I can keep this up every week while slightly increasing the quantum of work but also the quantum of reward, eventually it becomes a habit that I can no longer ignore.</p><p><strong>Use the feedback loop for everything</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I build software, so for me the feedback loop translates to building a small software module that does one particular task, run a few tests on it to see if it functions like it should and this will kick start the feedback loop. I feel rewarded that I built one tiny part of a large project which works perfectly and is ready to be integrated with the rest of the project.</p><p>Incremental steps can then be added by combining different modules with each other and making them work together. The loop becomes much stronger once there is an actual visual component to look at and interact with because at this point you have basically created something tangible and the reward you get from that lasts much longer than the smaller rewards.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>It is entirely possible that I put out this piece of content today and nobody cares. Maybe I do not see any spike in google analytics at all. But the very fact that I managed to write something today and share it a few people who are at the very least likely to give it a read creates a feeling of accomplishment which serves as a small reward to kick start the feedback loop. </p><p>Sometimes the reward is not as great as expected but as long as it is not zero, the loop is strong enough to get you going.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently worked on an open source <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">project called Jupiter</a>, an online AI to beat the popular online game <a href="http://play2048.co/">2048</a>.</p>
<p>Go try out the AI:</p>
<p><a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtrp/jupiter/master/demo-image.png" alt="Jupiter Screenshot"></a></p>
<p>In writing this AI, I decided to use a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Monte Carlo algorithms like the one used in Jupiter have been used in several notable AIs, including DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>, which famously beat the Go world champion in May 2017.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why the Monte Carlo method works</li>
<li>When and where Monte Carlo algorithms can be useful </li>
<li>How I used the Monte Carlo method in an AI to beat 2048</li>
<li>How to implement Monte Carlo algorithms in JavaScript and other languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I got the idea of using a Monte Carlo method to beat 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<h2>What is the Monte Carlo Method?</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is the idea of using a large number of random simulations of an experiment to gain insights into the experiment's end results. Random simulations of an experiment are frequently referred to as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you were flipping a coin, and trying to figure out the probability of the coin landing heads. With the Monte Carlo method, we could simulate 10,000 coin tosses, and calculate the percentage of coins that landed heads.</p>
<p>Here's what that would look like.</p>

<p>As can be seen, the result converges to the expected value, 50%. A notable feature of Monte Carlo simulations is that a higher number of simulations is correlated with higher accuracy. For example, if we only performed two simulations, there is a high (25%) probability of heads landing in both simulations, giving a result of 100%. This is very inaccurate in comparison to the expected result of 50%.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations <strong>work because of the Law of Large Numbers</strong>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you simulate the same experiment many times, the average of the results should converge to the expected value of the simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Monte Carlo simulations are a way to estimate what will happen in a given experiment <strong>without having to implement any specific algorithms or heuristics</strong>.</p>
<h2>When and Where the Monte Carlo Method Can Be Useful</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is used in a variety of fields, including game AI development, finance and economics, and evolutionary biology to name a few.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method can be useful in any experiment with a random factor, where end results cannot be predicted algorithmically. For example, in 2048, a new tile at a random location is added after every move, making it impossible to calculate the exact location of upcoming tiles and subsequently the end result of the game as well.</p>
<p>In these types of experiments, running a large number of Monte Carlo simulations can help get a sense of the average end results, the probability of various events occurring, and the relationship between the variables in the experiment.</p>
<p>For example, using the Monte Carlo method to in Jupiter allowed me to better understand how variables like starting move, number of moves in a game, and best tile in the board affected the end results of the game.</p>
<h2>How I Used the Monte Carlo Method in Jupiter, an AI to Beat 2048</h2>
<p>Let's start with a few definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board and Tiles</strong>: a 4x4 grid with tiles optionally placed on each grid spot</li>
<li><strong>Game State</strong>: a set of tiles on the board which represents the board at a specific time</li>
<li><strong>Game Score</strong>: the sum of all the tiles on the board</li>
<li><strong>Real Game</strong>: the game that is being played and shown on the browser, not a simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given game state, let's assume that four possible moves can be made: left, right, up, or down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are indeed cases where a certain move is not possible in a given game state. Removing impossible moves can be easily added to the algorithm later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Monte Carlo method, we can run a set of game simulations for every move.</p>
<p>For each possible move, the program simulates a set of simulations which <strong>start by playing the move for that set first</strong>. After that, the rest of the game can be played completely randomly until it is over.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, this algorithm looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>// assume Game object exists
// assume currentGame variable exists as the real game

const totalSimulations = 200; // 50 simulations are played for each move 

const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
possibleMoves.forEach((move) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>After all the simulations are completed, the program can gather the total final game scores of all the simulations, and average them for each move. We can then find the optimal move by optimizing for the highest final game score.</p>
<p>For example, if the simulations which started by playing left had an average final score of 250, whereas the ones which started by playing the other moves had an average final game score of 225, then left is the optimal move.</p>
<p>In this program, <strong>the optimal move is the one with simulations with the highest average final game score</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: I could have chosen to optimize for a different value such as the number of moves in the game.</strong></p>
<p>However, this would actually make no difference in how the algorithm functions, because the number of moves in the game almost exactly predicts the game score. In 2048, the new tile added after each game move is normally a 2 tile, but has a 10% chance of being a 4 tile instead. This means the expected value of the new tile is 2.2 (<code>2 × 90% + 4 × 10%</code>). The total value of tiles is also preserved after every tile combination (ex: 2 tile combined with another 2 tile gives a 4 tile). As a result, game score can be calculated by multiplying the expected value of the new tile by the number of moves in the game, or with this formula: <code>2.2 × (real game move count + average move count)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add this functionality of optimizing for highest score to our current code: add an array of total final scores for the simulations for each possible move, and choose the move with the highest value in that array to play like so:</p>
<pre><code>const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
const totalSimulations = 200;

let moveSimulationTotalScores = [0, 0, 0, 0];

possibleMoves.forEach((move, moveIndex) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
    moveSimulationTotalScores[moveIndex] += simulation.getScore();
  }
});

// make best move with highest total simulation scores
let topScore = Math.max(...moveSimulationTotalScores);
let topScoreIndex = moveSimulationTotalScores.indexOf(topScore);
let bestMove = possibleMoves[topScoreIndex];

currentGame.makeMove(bestMove);</code></pre>
<p>In the end, this algorithm is simple to implement given a well-written 2048 game class. In JavaScript, there are a number of performance upgrades that can be made, starting by adding concurrency with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> and pruning moves with very low final game scores.</p>
