<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" alt="" width="652" height="447" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em> <a href="https://slouchingtowardsthatcham.com/2019/07/10/social-media-for-influencers-organic-reach/">Organic reach in social media is going down and will continue to do so.</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>
<h2>Privacy is a BIG Issue </h2>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6054437144226106686" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
    Under general relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead it is a distortion of spacetime. Objects in free-fall move along geodesics (straight lines) in spacetime, as seen in the inertial frame of reference on the right. When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen on the left.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this system there is only one space dimension, shown on the vertical axis and labeled in meters. The time dimension is the horizontal axis and labeled in seconds. The gravitational field is constant within the area of interest. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the first slider to change the acceleration of the frame of reference in the middle. When the frame has zero acceleration it is said to be an inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the second slider to move the time window. Note that all the trajectories remain as straight lines in the inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can drag the start and end position of each object to change their trajectories. All free-fall trajectories in the inertial frame of reference are straight lines.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the more helpful frameworks that I’ve found in my career has been to aggressively avoid unforced errors in management. In tennis, unforced errors are cases where a player missed a shot due to their own mistake, rather than due to their opponent. In management, unforced errors are problems where the source is <em>you</em>, rather than an objective business need or external circumstance.</p>

<p>I define unforced errors as problems caused by taking action, when doing absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> would have worked just fine: cases when you mess with something that wasn’t broken in the first place. In addition to being annoying, unforced errors distract from existing priorities and open up new fronts in any battles that you’re currently engaged in. And since the solution is so easy – just do nothing – learning how to identify them can pay dividends.</p>

<h2 id="common-types-of-unforced-errors">Common Types of Unforced Errors</h2>

<p>Unforced errors generally come in a few easy to identify forms.</p>

<p>The most common is deciding to “fix” a problem that doesn’t matter, or that doesn’t exist at all. One of the prototypical examples is the decision to migrate to a new technology stack because it seems cool, or because your current technology choice is no longer in vogue. Maybe you’re running Ruby or PHP but really want to try out Rust, despite the fact that your product is otherwise working fine and you’re not having trouble finding and retaining engineers. This invention of a problem can lead to Tech Debt Science Projects in which your team rebuilds otherwise working technology. If anything breaks (it likely will), you’ve caused an unforced error.</p>

<p>Another class of unforced errors comes from deciding to standardize or regulate a system that’s working fine. For example, imagine a case where your engineering teams are all running agile processes differently. Some teams aren’t disciplined about retrospectives, some teams are highly regimented about story sizing while others wing it, and some teams occasionally insert “break” weeks in between sprints so that schedules never quite align. To a certain kind of person, this type of inconsistency feels deeply wrong – like a house in which all of the walls were a very slightly different color.</p>

<p>But your business doesn’t require consistency for aesthetic purposes, or for its own sake. In some situations, you can tolerate somewhat haphazard team processes for a surprisingly long time – dodging the upfront effort of standardization, the ongoing effort of maintaining it, and the overall risk of standardizing on a system that doesn’t actually help everyone on balance. (of course, if there are real upsides to enforcing consistency then you should go for it)</p>

<h2 id="catching-unforced-errors-before-they-happen">Catching Unforced Errors Before They Happen</h2>

<p>In my experience unforced errors often stem from a yearning for control. When times are tough it can be tempting to latch onto areas where you already have mastery and look for ways to optimize them, and this optimization feels like productive work. Ironically, this means that you’re more likely to cause unforced errors, as these familiar domains are areas where you’re probably doing well – focus is needed in the areas of the business that you rarely think about, where your existing decisions are the least battle-tested.</p>

<p>The general solution to unforced errors is to ruthlessly prioritize. Focus on the problems that are truly existential threats to your business and team, or represent transformational opportunities.</p>

<p>My simple heuristic for avoiding unforced errors is to always imagine the worst thing that can happen if you just skip a new project – what would happen if you had never thought about this initiative at all? This is especially true when you’re talking about changing something rather than doing something new. If the worst that happens is that you miss a chance for a 5-10% optimization of a non-essential part of your business, alarm bells should be gently ringing.</p>

<p>Unforced errors are a pain – not only do they distract, but the optics can be pretty bad when a lot of hard work backfires. By avoiding these hiccups, you can keep your team happier and focus on getting the wins that are most important to your business.</p>

You may be using Mastodon wrong

<p>October 18, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa

<p>I'm sure you have already heard about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>,
typically marketed as <em>a Twitter alternative</em>.</p>

<p>I will try to convince you that the word <em>alternative</em> doesn't mean here what you think it means,
and why you may be using Mastodon wrong if you find it boring.</p>

<h4>An alternative community</h4>

<p>You should not expect to "migrate from Twitter to Mastodon."</p>

<p>Forget about the privacy angle for now. Mastodon is an alternative community, where people behave
differently.</p>

<p><strong>It's your chance to make new internet friends.</strong></p>

<p>There may be some people for whom Mastodon is a safe haven. Yes, some users really do migrate
there to avoid censorship or bullying but, for most of us, that will not be the case.</p>

<p>Let's put it this way: Mastodon is to Twitter what Linux is to Windows.</p>

<p>Linux is libre software. But that's not why most people use it. Linux users mostly want 
to get their work done, and Linux is an excellent platform.
There is no Microsoft Word, no Adobe Photoshop, no Starcraft. If you need to use these tools, honestly,
you'd better stick with Windows. You can use emulation, in the same way that there are
utilities to post to Twitter from Mastodon, but that would miss the point.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you can perform the same tasks, but the process will be different.
You can post <em>toots</em> on Mastodon, upload gifs, send DMs... but it's not Twitter, and that is fine.</p>

<h4>The Local Timeline is Mastodon's greatest invention</h4>

<p>The problem most people have with Mastodon is that they "get bored" with it quickly. I've seen it a lot, and
it means one thing: <strong>the person created their account on the wrong server</strong>.</p>

<p>"But," they say, "isn't Mastodon federated? Can't I chat with everybody, regardless of their server?"
Yes, of course. But discoverability works differently on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Twitter has only two discoverability layers: your network and the whole world. Either a small group of
contacts, or everybody in the whole world. That's crazy.</p>

<p>They try very hard to show you tweets from outside your network so you can discover new people.
And, at the same time, they show your tweets to third parties, so you can get new followers.
This is the way that
they try to keep you engaged once your network is more or less stable and starts getting stale.</p>

<p>Mastodon, instead, has an extra layer between your network and the whole world:
messages from <em>people on your server</em>. This is called the <em>local timeline</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The local timeline is the key to enjoying Mastodon.</strong></p>

<h4>How long it's been since you made a new internet friend?</h4>

<p>If you're of a certain age you may remember BBSs, Usenet, the IRC, or early internet forums.
Do you recall how exciting it was to log into the unknown and realize that there were people
all around the world who shared your interests?</p>

<p>It was an amazing feeling which got lost on the modern internet. Now you have a chance to relive it.</p>

<p>The local timeline dynamics are very different. There is a lot of respectful interactions among total strangers,
because there is this feeling of community, of being in a neighborhood. Twitter is just the opposite, strangers
shouting at each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the local timeline is more or less limited in the amount of users, you have the chance
to recognize usernames, and being recognized. You start interacting with strangers, mentioning them, sending them
links they may like. You discover new websites, rabbit holes, new approaches to your hobbies.</p>

<p>I've made quite a few new <em>internet friends</em> on my Mastodon server, and I don't mean followers or contacts.
I'm talking about human beings who I have never met in person but feel close to.</p>

<p>People are humble and respectful. And, for less nice users, admins enforce codes of conduct and, 
on extreme cases, users may get kicked off a server. But they are not being banned by a faceless corporation
due to mass reports, everybody is given a chance.</p>

<h4>How to choose the right server</h4>

<p>The problem with "generalist" Mastodon servers like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>
is that users have just too diverse interests and backgrounds.
Therefore, there is no community feeling. For some people, that may be exactly what they're looking for. But, 
for most of us, there is more value on the smaller servers.</p>

<p>So, how can you choose the right server? Fortunately, you can do a bit of research. 
There is an official <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities">directory of Mastodon servers</a> categorized by
interests and regions. </p>

<p>Since you're reading my blog, start by taking a look at these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bsd.network/">bsd.network</a>, for fans of BSD systems</li>
<li><a href="http://linuxrocks.online/">linuxrocks.online</a>, for Linux fans</li>
<li><a href="http://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, for free software in general</li>
<li><a href="http://tilde.zone/">tilde.zone</a>, for oldschool internet users</li>
<li><a href="https://merveilles.town/">merveilles.town</a>, with a very particular mixture of art and technology</li>
<li><a href="https://metalhead.club/">metalhead.club</a>, to enjoy those classic riffs</li>
</ul>

<p>And the regionals</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodont.cat/">mastodont.cat</a> for catalans</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.madrid/">mastodon.madrid</a> for madrileños</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more. Simply search online for "mastodon server MY_FAVORITE_HOBBY." And believe me, servers
between 500 and 5,000 people are the best.</p>

<h4>Final tips</h4>

<p>Before clicking on "sign up", always browse the local timeline,
the about page, and the most active users list. You will get a pretty good idea of the kind of people
who chat there.
Once you feel right at home you can continue your adventure and start following users from other servers.</p>

<p>Mastodon has an option to only display toots in specific languages. It can be very useful to avoid being
flooded by toots that you just have no chance of understanding or even getting what they're about.</p>

<p>You can also filter your notifications by types: replies, mentions, favorites, reposts, and more.
This makes catching up much more manageable than on Twitter.</p>

<p>Finally, Mastodon has a built-in "Content Warning" feature. It allows you to hide
text behind a short explanation, in case you want to talk about sensible topics or just about spoiling
a recent movie.</p>

<p>Good luck with your search, and see you on the Fediverse! I'm at

  <p>This article considers the conditions that lead teams to produce overengineered software and describes how you can avoid falling prey to such conditions.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-overengineering">What do we mean by “overengineering”?</h2>

<p>When a software developer says that a piece of software is <em>overengineered</em>, they are saying that they think it has too many moving parts, too much abstraction, or an excessive emphasis on performance. The number of concepts required to understand the thing feels unreasonable.</p>

<p>It’s a fundamentally subjective call, but you know it when you see it. Like a Ferrari at a go kart race, an overengineered system is out of scale with its operating environment and intended usage.</p>

<p>But how does it happen? Are there certain conditions that lead teams to produce systems that observers would perceive as overengineered?</p>

<p>To determine this, let’s consider two stereotypical software
engineering phenomena: cargo culting and a related pattern that I’ve
started to call “the Xoogler effect”.</p>

<p>From there, we can characterize certain cognitive biases that drive a team towards overengineering.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-culting">​​Cargo culting</h2>
<p><img src="https://evanm.website/images/overengineering/cloudnativelandscape.jpg" alt="The Trillion Dollar Homepage"><span>Fig. 1. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">The Trillion Dollar Homepage</a>.</span></p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> is a cultural phenomenon in which technologically-advanced artifacts become objects of obsessive ritual to a group of people outside of the artifact-producing society. While the term has fallen out of favor within the field of anthropology (in acknowledgement of its reductive and colonialist overtones), it’s fairly common in software circles.</p>

<p>To a software engineer, “cargo culting” is used pejoratively to refer to the adoption of a technology or practice based solely on its origin or popularity. Loosely, the thinking goes that if a tool, language, or convention was developed at or inspired by ideas from a large, successful company, then that tool must have contributed to the company’s success. Thus, in adopting it, you increase your odds of also succeeding.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Era-defining companies like Intel and Google used OKRs, so we should too.”</li>
  <li>“The SRE book talks about how Google relies on service level objectives, so using them will help our services become more reliable.”</li>
  <li>“Most successful companies end up needing advanced load balancing and request-proxying systems to scale their microservices architectures. Our 10-person startup should adopt these systems in order to help us scale.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Like incorporating in Delaware or only hiring graduates of name-brand universities, a particular practice correlating with notable instances of company growth doesn’t imply causation. Just because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">popular or successful</a> company uses a technology doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate or worthwhile for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-xoogler-effect">The Xoogler effect</h2>

<p>When people leave engineering jobs at big, successful tech companies, they take their former employer’s engineering culture with them. This tends to be highly valuable, for both the technical acumen of the new company and the incoming engineer’s compensation package.</p>

<p>But this tendency can be taken too far. The incoming employee, believing that they have a direct line to the state of the art, may go on to recreate systems in their former employer’s image to an unreasonable degree.</p>

<p>Not to pick on Googlers, but something about that company’s culture really brings this out. There are many notable examples of Xooglers replicating Google-internal systems and practices in the outside world, either as independent startups or efforts within existing companies. I don’t find this terribly surprising, given the tone that’s set within Google—you spend your time there constantly being told that you’re among the best software engineers to walk the face of the Earth, using technologies unmatched in their power, quality, and scalability. It makes sense that former employees feel compelled to emulate things that worked at Google<sup><a id="fn1ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But this generalizes to other large and/or successful companies. Many people leave the productivity bubble of a “FAANG and friends” company and end up building tools and systems that they miss. To name but a few, this is how we got Thrift, Envoy, and <a href="https://bazel.build/">three</a> <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">different</a> <a href="https://buck.build/">tools</a> based on Google’s build system.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-biases">Cognitive biases</h2>

<p>I think these two phenomena can be linked to a handful of widely-known cognitive biases. Cargo culting is a clear manifestation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">authority bias</a>. And the Xoogler effect seems related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">the law of the instrument</a>.</p>

<p>It’s rational to want to stay within your <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>, but it can be counterproductive in excess. When you’ve been inculcated in the expert use of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. Your thinking in new environments is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> by prior experience in old environments, which can impede learning and the development of new skills.</p>

<p>And it turns out that these two patterns can feed on each other. Cargo culting is <em>catalyzed by</em> the Xoogler effect in cases when a former big company employee’s experience is uncritically venerated by new colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-resist-the-urge-to-overengineer">How to resist the urge to overengineer</h2>

<p>Resisting the temptation to overengineer requires one to be honest with themselves about the context in which they’re operating.</p>

<p>You should always design systems to address problems that are in front of you instead of falling for solutions to problems faced by big companies in the past. You shouldn’t base your company’s infrastructure on GitHub stars. And as wistful as you may be for your last company’s tools, they may not be as applicable to your current situation as you think.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-cargo-without-becoming-a-cultist">Assessing cargo without becoming a cultist</h3>

<p>When evaluating a popular tool, language, or convention, it’s worthwhile to take the time to understand the underlying forces that motivated its invention<sup><a id="fn2ref" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Before making any decisions, try to contextualize a technology within the environment that formed it. From there, you can pattern match that environment to your own in order to determine if the technology is appropriate.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s consider everyone’s favorite overengineering punching bag: Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Kubernetes traces its conceptual lineage to Borg<sup><a id="fn3ref" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, the cluster-management system that’s run Google’s production workloads for over a dozen years. The main value that Borg provides to Alphabet is its ability to maximize the capital efficiency of their datacenters. The technology that we now call “container orchestration” allowed them to get more computing oomph out of their fleet by maximizing utilization and making more efficient use of machines they’d already paid for.</p>

<p>Is maximizing capital efficiency of your datacenter or cloud environment a concern for your company? If you believe Kubernetes offers other benefits<sup><a id="fn4ref" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>, are you confident that they outweigh the complexity and maintenance overhead?</p>

<p>I find this thought process helpful when evaluating new tools, patterns, frameworks, or management practices. Conventional wisdom advocates that you fully understand a problem before applying a solution to it. It’s also important to understand the conditions that led to a solution and how those conditions align with those you find yourself in.</p>

<p>Regardless of the decision you end up making, this process is likely to make you a better engineer. The job is fundamentally about building systems to solve problems at reasonable cost. That cost is measured not only as upfront capital expenditure, but in the ongoing drag associated with maintenance and cognitive load. More often than we realize, engineering is about right-sizing a solution in light of these ongoing costs.</p>

        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for programming in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> Programming Language and in other text editing environments that require a wide range of specialist and technical Unicode characters. It was intended as a fun experiment to be presented at the 2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal (which of course didn’t physically happen in Lisbon, but online).</p><p>The original temporary website used JuliaMono everywhere, so let's try to make the rest of this page do the same.</p><div><p>To download and install JuliaMono, see the instructions <a href="#download_and_install">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are different weights of JuliaMono, so you can control the amount of contrast you have in your highlighted code: <span>JuliaMono-Light</span>, JuliaMono-Regular, <span>JuliaMono-Medium</span>, <span>JuliaMono-Bold</span>, <span>JuliaMono-ExtraBold</span>, and <span>JuliaMono-Black</span>. <sup id="fnref:masters"><a href="#fndef:masters">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>(There are also versions of two of the fonts with “Latin” in the name: these are stripped down versions supporting just the basic MacRoman/Windows1252 “Latin” character sets, intended for use as place-holders, of interest mainly if you want to have more control over font loading times in web browser-based applications.)</p>
<p>In the hands of a virtuoso (such as Dr Zygmunt Szpak, the author of the following Julia code fragment<sup id="fnref:zscode"><a href="#fndef:zscode">[4]</a></sup>), the range of available Unicode characters can be quite expressive:</p>
<pre><code>function T(𝛉::AbstractArray,
           𝒞::Tuple{AbstractArray,
           Vararg{AbstractArray}},
           𝒟::Tuple{AbstractArray, Vararg{AbstractArray}})
    ⊗ = kron
    l = length(𝛉)
    𝐈ₗ = SMatrix{l,l}(1.0I)
    𝐈ₘ = SMatrix{1,1}(1.0I)
    𝐓 = @SMatrix zeros(l,l)
    N = length(𝒟[1])
    ℳ, ℳʹ = 𝒟
    Λ₁, Λ₂ = 𝒞
    𝚲ₙ = @MMatrix zeros(4,4)
    𝐞₁ = @SMatrix [1.0; 0.0; 0.0]
    𝐞₂ = @SMatrix [0.0; 1.0; 0.0]
    for n = 1:N
        index = SVector(1,2)
        𝚲ₙ[1:2,1:2] .=  Λ₁[n][index,index]
        𝚲ₙ[3:4,3:4] .=  Λ₂[n][index,index]
        𝐦    = hom(ℳ[n])
        𝐦ʹ   = hom(ℳʹ[n])

<p>One of the goals of JuliaMono is to include most of the characters that a typical programmer would reasonably expect to find. (Except for all those emojis - they are best handled by the operating system.) Here’s a thousand or so chosen at random:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicode-sample.svg" width="100%" alt="Unicode sampler"></p><p>In JuliaMono, every character is the same width, because this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced</a> typeface. Usually, typefaces with a lot of Unicode mathematical symbols are not monospaced, because they’re intended for use in prose and \( \LaTeX \) applications, rather than in programming code.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, forcing every character into the same size box is a problem. It’s like fitting every human being of whatever shape or size into identical airplane seats - some characters are bound to look uncomfortable. There’s never quite enough room for a nice-looking “m” or “w”.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl">UnicodePlots.jl</a> uses various Unicode characters to plot figures directly in a terminal window. <sup id="fnref:linespacing"><a href="#fndef:linespacing">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicodeplots.png" alt="UnicodePlots in action"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageInTerminal.jl">ImageInTerminal.jl</a> is similarly awesome, conjuring images from Unicode characters:</p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/imageinterminal.png" alt="ImageInTerminal"></p><p>JuliaMono is quite greedy<sup id="fnref:greedy"><a href="#fndef:greedy">[7]</a></sup>, and contains a lot of Unicode glyphs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/barchart.svg" width="100%" alt="silly barchart"></p><p>(Of course, size isn’t everything - quality can beat quantity, and other fonts will offer different experiences<sup id="fnref:otherfonts"><a href="#fndef:otherfonts">[8]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to support box-drawing characters and DataFrames.jl output (terminal permitting):</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; df = DataFrame(A=samples, B=glyphs)
df = 10×2 DataFrame

<p>(Can you spot the little used and sadly mathematically-unsupported "times" character?)</p>
<p>If you want to know whether you can use a Unicode character as an identifier in your Julia code, use the undocumented function <code>Base.isidentifier()</code>. So, for example, if you have the urge to use a dingbat (one of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats">Herman Zapf dingbat</a> designs), you could look for something suitable in the output of this:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; for n in 0x2700:0x27bf
			Base.isidentifier(string(Char(n))) &amp;&amp; print(Char(n))

<p>JuliaMono is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a> typeface. OpenType technology provides powerful text positioning, pattern matching, and glyph substitution features, which are essential for languages such as Arabic and Urdu. In English, OpenType features are often seen when letter pairs such as <span>fi</span> in certain fonts are replaced by a single glyph such as <span>ﬁ</span>. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature">ligatures</a> have been used ever since printing with moveable type was invented, replacing the occasional awkward character combination with a better-looking alternative.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not a big fan of their use in coding fonts (and I’m not the only one<sup id="fnref:nottheonlyone"><a href="#fndef:nottheonlyone">[9]</a></sup>). I like to see exactly what I’ve typed, rather than what the font has decided to replace it with. But, there are a few places in Julia where suitable Unicode alternatives are not accepted by the language, and where I feel that the ASCII-art confections currently used can be gently enhanced by the judicious use of alternate glyphs. There are also a few places where some subtle tweaks can enhance the readability of the language without introducing ambiguity.</p>
<p>In JuliaMono, the following substitutions are applied when the <strong>contextual alternates</strong> feature is active:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <th><p>typed</p></th>
    <th><p>displayed</p></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>::</td>
    <td>::</td>
    </tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>You can see these in action in the following code fragment:<sup id="fnref:width"><a href="#fndef:width">[10]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>julialang = true # (!= 0)
(x, y) -&gt; (x + y)
f(p::Int) = p * p
@inbounds if f in (Base.:+, Base.:-)
    if any(x -&gt; x &lt;: AbstractArray{&lt;:Number})
         nouns = Dict(
            Base.:+ =&gt; "addition",
            Base.:- =&gt; "subtraction",
        )
    end
end
df2 = df |&gt;
    @groupby(_.a) |&gt;
    @map({a = key(_), b = mean(_.b)}) |&gt;
    DataFrame # &lt;|</code></pre>
<p>OpenType fonts also offer you the ability to choose different designs for certain characters. These are stored as a ‘stylistic set’.</p>
<p>All the options are stored in the font, and are often referred to by their internal four letter code (not the best user-oriented design, really). For example, the contextual alternates listed above are collectively stored in the <strong>calt</strong> feature.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an application will show the options more visually in a Typography panel<sup id="fnref:typographypanel"><a href="#fndef:typographypanel">[11]</a></sup>, usually tucked away somewhere on a Font chooser dialog.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the stylistic sets currently available in JuliaMono.</p>

<p>
     The instruction set of the PDP-11 was designed towards a clean,
     general, symmetric instruction set.  It can be used as a
     register-based, stack-based, or memory-based machine, depending
     on the programmer's preferences.  Interrupt responsiveness is
     also important, supported with multiple interrupt levels for
     real-time computing as well as allowing for a separate interrupt
     handler for each device that generates interrupts.
</p><p>
     Word length is 16 bits with the leftmost, most significant bit
     (MSB) being bit 15.  There are eight general registers of 16 bits
     each.  Register 7 is the program counter (PC) and, by convention,
     Register 6 is the stack pointer (SP).  There is also a Processor
     Status Register/Word (PSW) which indicates the 4 condition code
     bits (N, Z, V, C), the Trace Trap bit, processor interrupt
     priority, and 4 bits for current and previous operating modes.
     Addressing on the -11 is linear from memory address 0 through
     177777.  Memory management allows access to physical memory with
     addresses of up to 22 bits (17777777).  All I/O devices,
     registers etc are addressed as if they were part of memory.
     These live in the 4KW of reserved memory space at the top of the
     addressing range.  Additionally, on most implementations of the
     PDP-11 architecture, the processor's registers are memory-mapped
     to the range 17777700-17777717 (there are many control registers
     beyond just the general registers, the specifics vary between
     implementations).  Thus Register 2 (R2) has an address of
     17777702.  All word memory addresses are even, except for registers.
     In byte operations, an even address specifies the least-significant
     byte and an odd address specifies the most-significant byte.
     Specifying an odd byte in a word operation will return an odd
     address trap.  Memory addresses from 0 to 400 octal are reserved
     for various exception traps such as timeouts, reserved
     instructions, parity, etc., and device interrupts.
</p><p>
     Addressing for the Single Operand, Double Operand and
     Jump instructions is achieved via six bits:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|_|_|_|
                         |Mode |Reg  |
</pre><p>
     where the modes are as follows: (Reg = Register, Def = Deferred)
</p><pre>     Mode 0  Reg           Direct addressing of the register
     Mode 1  Reg Def       Contents of Reg is the address
     Mode 2  AutoIncr      Contents of Reg is the address, then Reg incremented
     Mode 3  AutoIncrDef   Content of Reg is addr of addr, then Reg Incremented
     Mode 4  AutoDecr      Reg is decremented then contents is address
     Mode 5  AutoDecrDef   Reg is decremented then contents is addr of addr
     Mode 6  Index         Contents of Reg + Following word is address
     Mode 7  IndexDef      Contents of Reg + Following word is addr of addr
</pre><p>
     Note that the right-most bit of the mode is an indirection bit.
</p><p>
     Although not special cases, when dealing with R7 (aka the PC), some of
     these operations are called different things:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|1|1|1|
                         |Mode |  R7 |

     Mode 2  Immediate     Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 3  Absolute      Address of Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 6  Relative      Instr address+4+Next word is Address
     Mode 7  RelativeDef   Instr address+4+Next word is Address of address
</pre><p>
     Mainstream instructions are broken into Single operand and Double
     operand instructions, which in turn can be word or byte instructions.
</p>
<h2>Double Operand Instructions</h2>
<pre>                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                     |b|i|i|i|s|s|s|s|s|s|d|d|d|d|d|d|

                     | | Op  | Source    |  Dest     |
</pre><p>
     Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and
     byte-sized (b=1) operands.  In the table below, the mnemonics and
     names are given in the order b=0/b=1.
</p><p>
     The double operand instructions are:
</p><dl>

              </dt><dd>Compares values by subtracting the destination
              from the source, setting the condition codes, and
              then discarding the result of the subtraction.
</dd><dt>b 011 ssssss dddddd -- BIT/BITB  <i>Bit Test Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Performs a bit-wise AND of the source and the

</dd><dt>b 100 ssssss dddddd -- BIC/BICB  <i>Bit Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is cleared
              in the destination.  This is accomplished by taking the
              ones-complement of the source and ANDing it with the
              destination.  The result of the AND is stored in the
              destination.
</dd><dt>b 101 ssssss dddddd -- BIS/BISB  <i>Bit Set Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is set in
              the destination.  This is accomplished by ORing the
              source and destination, and storing the result in the
              destination.

              Note that this is a special case for b=1, in that
              it does not indicate that byte-wide operands are

</p><dl>
          <dt>b 000 000 011 dddddd -- SWAB/BPL   <i>Swap Bytes/Branch Plus</i>
              </dt><dd>Swap bytes exchanges the two bytes found in the
              destination, writing the result back to it.
<p>
              The branch (b=1) is described in the section on
              branches, below.
</p><p>
              Note that SWAB is actually a bit pattern from the
              range reserved for branches.  This particular
              pattern is otherwise unused, as it would be a
              modification of BR, Branch Always, which has no
              obvious semantics.
</p></dd><dt>b 000 101 000 dddddd -- CLR/CLRB   <i>Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Sets all the bits in destination to zero.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 001 dddddd -- COM/COMB   <i>Complement Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Calculates the ones-complement of the operand,
              and stores it.  The ones-complement is formed by

</dd><dt>b 000 101 010 dddddd -- INC/INCB   <i>Increment Word/Byte</i>

		</div><p>BERLIN — The European Union aims to spend up to €10 billion over the next seven years to help build up a homegrown cloud computing sector that could rival foreign corporations such as Amazon, Google and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Twenty-five EU countries signed a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-next-generation-cloud-europe" target="_blank">joint declaration</a> Thursday pledging public money to power up the cloud sector and establishing the "European Alliance on Industrial Data and Cloud," a partnership geared toward facilitating such projects.</p>
<p>The alliance — whose funding is to be drawn from existing EU programs and hoped-for pledges from industry and national capitals — will be launched by the end of the year. Cyprus and Denmark were the only EU member countries not to sign the declaration due to “technical reasons.”</p>
<p>The declaration “is a foundation stone for the establishment of European cloud technology, which will be very high performing,” said Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, following a meeting of European telecoms ministers organized by the German government, which currently holds the EU’s rotating Council presidency.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the prejudices, we are not late [on cloud development]. We are the first to get involved in the industrial cloud,” he added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services” — <em>Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The cloud alliance is a key part of the European Commission’s data strategy, which aims to create a single market for industrial data. Commissioner Breton in particular has lobbied hard to make the EU a worldwide data hub, and to develop data processing capabilities that would give Europe an edge over foreign rivals that currently dominate the cloud business.</p>
<p>It also fits in with broader efforts by European policymakers to make the Continent less dependent on foreign technology. Currently, U.S. technology firms dominate the global market for cloud storage.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the bloc is set to unveil by December a rulebook for platforms dubbed the “Digital Services Act," as well as binding laws for artificial intelligence that are set to be released early next year.</p>
<p>The new alliance will have the mandate to develop business, investment and implementation plans for European cloud technologies in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Signatories also pledge to create common European standards and policy norms to create pan-European cloud services, and help small and medium-sized businesses, startups and the public sector embrace cloud technology.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve digital sovereignty, we need to start approaching data processing the way major American and Chinese companies — the hyper-scalers — approach it,” said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.</p>
<p>“This is an area where we’re far from being equals,” he added.</p>
<h3>Money, money, money</h3>
<p>The Commission’s plan is to invest up to €10 billion to develop Europe's cloud and data infrastructures.</p>
<p>The EU’s executive arm would invest €2 billion from programs in its long-term budget such as the Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility 2 and InvestEU.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will come from both industry and member countries. National governments will be able to fund these projects through the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan, which has earmarked 20 percent toward digital projects.</p>
<p>The joint cloud declaration also issues demands to non-European cloud companies.</p>
<p>Cloud providers must “guarantee European standards in terms of security, data protection, consumer protection, data portability and energy efficiency and contribute to European digital sovereignty.”</p>
<p>The companies must offer “adequate assurance” that the EU will maintain control over its strategic and sensitive data.</p>
<p>“While all cloud providers are welcome in European cloud federation, the resulting cloud capacities should not be subject to laws of foreign jurisdictions,” the declaration read.</p>
<p>One of the first initiatives to come out of Europe’s cloud push is Gaia-X, a much-hyped European effort spearheaded by Germany and France to build up a European platform that sets common standards for cloud technology. Gaia-X has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1449266">limited</a> the voting rights of non-European cloud computing companies, and they cannot become directors of the association.</p>
<p>ETNO, the association representing Europe’s leading telecom operators, applauded the move.</p>
<p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services. We call for EU targets and commitments that reflect the demand side of the cloud investment story,” said Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general.</p>
<p>Tech lobby DigitalEurope was equally supportive, and announced it was applying for membership in Gaia-X.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Previously, we took a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pytorch-pipeline/">simple video pipeline</a> and made it as fast as we could without sacrificing the flexibility of the Python runtime. It’s amazing how far you can go — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">9 FPS to 650 FPS</a> — but we did not reach full hardware utilization and the pipeline did not scale linearly beyond a single GPU. There is evidence (measured using <a href="https://github.com/chrisjbillington/gil_load">gil_load</a>) that we were throttled by a fundamental Python limitation with multiple threads fighting over the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (GIL).</p>
<p>In this article we’ll take performance of the same <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300 model</a> even further, leaving Python behind and moving towards true production deployment technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html"><strong>TorchScript.</strong></a> Instead of running directly in the Pytorch runtime, we’ll export our model using TorchScript tracing into a form that can be executed portably using the <code>libtorch</code> C++ runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt"><strong>TensorRT.</strong></a> This toolset from Nvidia includes a “deep learning inference optimizer” — a compiler for optimizing CUDA-based computational graphs. We’ll use this to squeeze out every drop of inference efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk"><strong>DeepStream.</strong></a> While <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Gstreamer</a> gives us an extensive library of elements to build media pipelines with, DeepStream expands this library with a set of GPU-accelerated elements specialized for machine learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies fit together like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/deepstream_hybrid.svg" alt="DeepStream Hybrid Architecture"></p>
<p>This article will not be a step-by-step tutorial with code examples, but will show what is possible when these technologies are combined. The associated repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>.</p>
<h3 id="torchscript-vs-tensorrt">
  🔥TorchScript vs TensorRT🔥
  <a href="#torchscript-vs-tensorrt">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Both TorchScript and TensorRT can produce a deployment-ready form of our model, so why do we need both? These great tools may eventually be competitors but in 2020 they are complementary — they each have weaknesses that are compensated for by the other.</p>
<p><strong>TorchScript.</strong> With a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code we can generate a deployment-ready asset from essentially any Pytorch model that will run anywhere libtorch runs. It’s not inherently faster (it is submitting approximately the same sequence of kernels) but the libtorch runtime will perform better under high concurrency. However, without care TorchScript output may have performance and portability surprises (I’ll cover some of these in a later article).</p>
<p><strong>TensorRT.</strong> An unparalleled model compiler for Nvidia hardware, but for Pytorch or <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a>-based models it has incomplete support and suffers from poor portability. There is a plugin system to add arbitrary layers and postprocessing, but this low-level work is out of reach for groups without specialized deployment teams. TensorRT also doesn’t support cross-compilation so models must be optimized directly on the target hardware — not great for embedded platforms or highly diverse compute ecosystems.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a baseline from the previous post in this series — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">Object Detection from 9 FPS to 650 FPS in 6 Steps</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/#stage-2-postprocessing-on-gpu">Postprocessing on GPU</a> stage from my previous post is logically closest to our first DeepStream pipeline. This was a fairly slow, early stage in the Python-based optimization journey but limitations in DeepStream around batching and memory transfer make this the best comparison.</p>
<p>This Python-based pipeline runs at around 80 FPS:</p>








<p>After we get a basic DeepStream pipeline up and running we’ll empirically understand and then remove the limitations we see.</p>

<p>Our approach to using TorchScript and TensorRT together in a DeepStream pipeline will be to construct a hybrid model with two sequential components — a TensorRT frontend passing results to a TorchScript backend which completes the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">
  Hybrid DeepStream Pipeline
  <a href="#hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our hybrid pipeline will eventually use the <code>nvinfer</code> element of DeepStream to serve a TensorRT-compiled form of the SSD300 model directly in the media pipeline. Since TensorRT cannot compile the entire model (due to unsupported <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> ops) we’ll run the remaining operations as a TorchScript module (via <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/plugin-manual/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_details.html#wwpID0E0TDB0HA">the <code>parse-bbox-func-name</code> hook</a>).</p>
<p>However, the first pipeline will be the simplest possible while still following the hybrid pattern. The TensorRT model does no processing and simply passes frames to the TorchScript model, which does all preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. 0% TensorRT, 100% TorchScript.</p>
<p>This pipeline runs at 110 FPS without tracing overhead. However, this TorchScript model has already been converted to <code>fp16</code> precision so a direct comparison to the Python-based pipeline is a bit misleading.</p>








<p>Let’s drill into the trace with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nvidia’s Nsight Systems</a> to understand the patterns of execution. I have zoomed in to the processing for two 16-frame batches:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch_hu85cb8d526cf1fda403db89df3e60bf80_432723_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the red NVTX ranges on the <code>GstNvInfer</code> line we can see overlapping ranges where batches of 16 frames are being processed. However, the pattern of processing on the GPU is quite clear from the 16 utilisation spikes — it is processing frame-by-frame.  We also see constant memory transfers between device and host.</p>
<p>Drilling in to see just two frames of processing, the pattern is even more clear:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_421239_896x540_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="540">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>With a little knowledge of how DeepStream works the problem is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> sends batches of frames to the configured model engine (our empty TensorRT component) — great.</li>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> then sends the model output <em>frame by frame</em> to the postprocessing hook (our TorchScript component).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we have put our entire model into a TorchScript postprocessing hook we are now processing frame by frame with no batching, and this is causing very low GPU utilisation. (This is why we are comparing against a Python pipeline with no batching).</p>
<p><strong>We are using DeepStream contrary to the design</strong>, but to build a truly hybrid TensorRT and TorchScript pipeline we need batched postprocessing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing Hooks are Frame-by-Frame</strong></p>
<p>The design of <code>nvinfer</code> assumes model output will be postprocessed frame-by-frame. This makes writing postprocessing code a tiny bit easier but is inefficient by default. Preprocessing, inference and postprocessing logic should always assume a batch dimension is present.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Nsight Systems view above also shows a pointless sequence of device-to-host then host-to-device transfers. The purple device-to-host memory transfer is due to <code>nvinfer</code> sending tensors to system memory, ready for the postprocessing code to use it. The green host-to-device transfers are me putting this memory back on the GPU where it belongs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing is Assumed to Happen on Host</strong></p>
<p>This is a legacy of early machine learning approaches. Modern deep learning pipelines keep data on the GPU end-to-end, including data augmentation and postprocessing. See Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI">DALI library</a> for an example of this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, time to hack DeepStream and remove these limitations.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Nvidia have provided source for the <code>nvinfer</code> pipeline element. I’ve made two changes to better support our approach of doing significant work in the postprocessing hook and fix the above limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> model engine output is now sent in a single batch to the postprocessing hook.</li>
<li>Model output tensors are no-longer copied to host, but are left on the device.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  These <code>nvinfer</code> changes are unreleased and are not present in the companion repository (<a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>) because they are clearly derivative of <code>nvinfer</code> and I’m unsure of the licensing. Nvidia people, feel free to get in touch: <a href="mailto:paul@paulbridger.com">paul@paulbridger.com</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>With hacked DeepStream and no model changes at all this pipeline now hits 350 FPS when measured with no tracing overhead. This is up from 110 FPS with regular DeepStream. I think we deserve a chart:</p>








<p>The <code>Concurrency 1x2080Ti</code> stage from the Python pipeline is now the closest comparison both in terms of FPS and optimizations applied. Both pipelines have batched inference, video frames decoded and processed on GPU end-to-end, and concurrency at the batch level (note the overlapping NVTX ranges below). One additional level of concurrency in the Python pipeline is multiple overlapping CUDA streams.</p>
<p>The Nsight Systems view shows processing for several 16-frame batches:</p>

</a>

<p>We now have good GPU utilization and very few needless memory transfers, so the path forward is to optimize the TorchScript model. Until now the TensorRT component has been entirely pass-through and everything from preprocessing, inference and postprocessing has been in TorchScript.</p>
<p>It’s time to start using the TensorRT optimizer, so get ready for some excitement.</p>

<p>According to Nvidia, TensorRT <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">“dramatically accelerates deep learning inference performance”</a> so why not compile 100% of our model with TensorRT?</p>
<p>The Pytorch export to TensorRT consists of a couple of steps, and both provide an opportunity for incomplete support:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export the Pytorch model to the <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> interchange representation via <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#tracing-vs-scripting">tracing or scripting</a>.</li>
<li>Compile the ONNX representation into a TensorRT engine, the optimized form of the model.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you try to create an optimized TensorRT engine for this entire model (SSD300 including postprocessing), the first problem you will run into is the export to ONNX of the …</p></article></div>

			<p>This is a technical write up of the author’s investigation on how users of Samsung phones in Hong Kong (and Macau), using firmware released in September 2020, would be forced to use a public DNS service in Mainland China, which caused unease and privacy concerns among some of its users.</p>
<p>While this was investigated on a variant of a Galaxy Note 10+ phone targetting the Hong Kong market, it was reported that the issue exists for a wide range of recent Samsung phones, including those sold in other places when used in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Update: The firmware update released in Mid-October 2020 has fixed the DNS issue discussed in this Part, but the issue of DNS queries for <code>qq.com</code> discussed in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/15/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users-2/">Part 2</a> remained unchanged.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Shameless plug (for Hong Kong users): The author is the developer of Headuck Call blocker (useful only in Hong Kong). Earlier it got mistakenly flagged as malware by Google and lost many of its users, but the appeal was successful and the App is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headuck.headuckblocker.dev">on Google Play</a> again. Please re-consider the App if you got scared by the earlier Google Play malware warning.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In early October 2020, a Samsung phone user in Hong Kong, local forum (HKEPC) user dingwinslow209, <a href="https://www.hkepc.com/forum/viewthread.php?fid=168&amp;tid=2586830">reported that (link to forum post in Chinese)</a> an extra DNS server entry, <code>114.114.114.114</code> was added to the DNS setting of his Samsung mobile phone, which was updated with the latest firmware, whenever he was using a WiFi connection.&nbsp; This happened both when the DNS setting is static, or dynamic using DHCP (but not when VPN / mobile network was used).&nbsp; Even when both DNS1 and DNS2 were set to valid DNS servers (e.g. Google public DNS service using <code>DNS1 = 8.8.8.8</code> and <code>DNS2 = 8.8.4.4</code>), a new DNS3 entry pointing to <code>114.114.114.114</code> would appear in some utility app.</p>
<p>This immediately raised privacy concerns among some Samsung users in Hong Kong, as the public DNS server <code>114.114.114.114</code> is owned by Cogent Communications, under <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/114.114.114.114">Nanjing XinFeng Information Technologies Inc</a>, in Mainland China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in another local forum (lihkg), users captured DNS requests to <code>114.114.114.114</code>, and observed queries for “<code>qq.com</code>”&nbsp; (domain owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent), even when no software from Tencent is installed in the devices.&nbsp; There were reports that these DNS queries were sent once per minute, so long as the phone screen remained on.</p>
<p>There are further reports that when DNS queries to qq.com were blocked, the phone would report no internet connectivity via the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>The observation of the extra DNS entry was later independently confirmed by other forum users and the local media, using recent Samsung phones which have been updated in recent months.&nbsp; (See the links in the HKPEC post above, in Chinese).&nbsp; The issue persisted even when users reset their Samsung phone to factory settings. This showed that the issue originates from Samsung firmware instead of some third-party software malware.</p>
<p>The following documents the technical investigation and verification of the issue directly from analysing the code from firmware.&nbsp; The information should be sufficient for the issue and its extent to be independently verified.</p>
<h3>Getting and extracting the firmware</h3>
<p>To confirm the issue, a recent Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ firmware (SM-N9750 TGY, Hong Kong version), at Security Patch level 2020-09-01 was downloaded from one of the Samsung firmware download sites. Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the Samsung models reportedly&nbsp;affected.</p>
<p>After unzipping the downloaded firmware (in zip format), expanding the tar file beginning with “<code>AP_N9750ZSU3CTH1</code>“, decompressing the file <code>system.img.ext4.lz4</code> using <code>lz4</code>, converting it to ext4 format using <code>simg2img</code>, and mounting it as ext4 volume under Linux, one has access to the system image which would be installed when Note 10+ users update their phone to that patch level. (The same is accessible if a Note 10+ phone is rooted).</p>
<p>After some research, the culprit was found – a vendor specific service level component, added by Samsung to the Android framework, located at <code>/system/framework/wifi-service.jar</code>. This seems to work at the android system service level, supplementing the usual <code>services.jar</code>.</p>
<p>The decompiled source of the jar file (using <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this site</a>, with Jadx decompiler) has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY">https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY</a>.&nbsp; The following is a walkthrough of the relevant code when a user connects to a WiFi network, showing how the DNS entries were modified.</p>
<h3>Relevant flow of DNS entry addition</h3>
<p>The main culprit is the class <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, located in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>. The decompiled code contains the following:</p>
<p>line 129: the hardcoded address <code>114.114.114.114</code></p>
<pre>private static final String CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP = "114.114.114.114";</pre>
<p>line 878: addresses used for DNS probe (to be covered in next part).</p>
<pre>public final String DEFAULT_URL = "http://www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_CHINA = "http://www.qq.com";
public String DEFAULT_URL_STRING = "www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_STRING_CHINA = "www.qq.com";</pre>
<p>This large class is mainly a state machine of the various WiFi states. The state hierarchy are defined, and initial state set, at lines 1185-1197.</p>
<pre>addState(this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mNotConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mCaptivePortalState, this.mConnectedState);
addState(this.mEvaluatedState, this.mConnectedState);
....
setInitialState(this.mNotConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The base class for the StateMachine can be found under AOSP source (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/util/StateMachine.java?q=StateMachine.java&amp;ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject">StateMachine.java</a>).</p>
<p>When the device is connected to WiFi, it would enter <code>ConnectedState</code>.</p>
<p>line 1976 (under <code>processMessage()</code> of the initial <code>NotConnectedState</code>) would be invoked when a new WiFi connection is detected.</p>
<pre>wifiConnectivityMonitor.transitionTo(wifiConnectivityMonitor.mConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The <code>mConnectedState</code> variable is of class <code>ConnectedState</code>, defined from line 1988. The <code>enter()</code> method of <code>ConnectedState</code> contains the following code (from line 2090), which uses <code>CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP</code> (i.e. the Mainland Chinese controlled DNS server):</p>
<pre>if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager != null &amp;&amp; WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
    Message msg = new Message();
    msg.what = 330;
    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putString("publicDnsServer", WifiConnectivityMonitor.CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP);
    msg.obj = args;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager.callSECApi(msg);
}
</pre>
<p>From the code it seems to add the Mainland Chinese DNS service to the user’s list of DNS server automatically, when the device is connected to Chinese mobile network. There seems no option to disable the behaviour.</p>
<p><code>WifiConnectivityMonitor.inChinaNetwork()</code> is at line 11199.&nbsp; As suggested by its name, it should obtain the ISO code and return true only if the device is connected to a mobile network in China:</p>
<pre>public boolean inChinaNetwork() {
    String str = this.mCountryIso;
    if (str == null || str.length() != 2) {
        updateCountryIsoCode();
    }
    if (!isChineseIso(this.mCountryIso)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!DBG) {
        return true;
    }
    Log.d(TAG, "Need to skip captive portal check. CISO: " + this.mCountryIso);
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Digging deeper, this is how the ISO code (<code>mCountryIso</code>) is obtained, under <code>updateCountryIsoCode()</code> at line 11219 (fallback skipped).</p>
<pre>public void updateCountryIsoCode() {
    if (this.mTelephonyManager == null) {
        try {
            this.mTelephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) this.mContext.getSystemService("phone");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Exception occured at updateCountryIsoCode(), while retrieving Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE");
        }
    }
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = this.mTelephonyManager;
    if (telephonyManager != null) {
        this.mCountryIso = telephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso();
        Log.i(TAG, "updateCountryIsoCode() via TelephonyManager : mCountryIso: " + this.mCountryIso);
    }
    /* fallback when there is no mobile network skipped. The fallback is to read the CountryISO setting from a Samsung config file (cscfeature.xml) */
    ....
}
</pre>
<p>(While not shown here, this code is also invoked when initializing and when change in ISO code of telephone network is detected, so it need not be called during each check.) The country code is get from <code>TelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso()</code> which is a standard Android API, documented <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getNetworkCountryIso()">here</a>. It returns the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code equivalent of the MCC (Mobile Country Code) of the mobile operator. In Hong Kong, this is “HK”, and in Mainland China this is “CN”.</p>
<p>As one might suspect at this point, the problem lies in <code>isChineseIso()</code>, at line 11214:</p>
<pre>private boolean isChineseIso(String countryIso) {
    return "cn".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "hk".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "mo".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso);
}</pre>
<p>This means that you are treated as being connected to a Chinese mobile network if you are connected to a Hong Kong mobile network for the purpose of adding the 114 DNS service.&nbsp; (BTW, “MO” is the ISO-3166-1 code for Macau.) Perhaps Samsung might want to address cases when people travel to Mainland China while forgetting to reset their hardcoded DNS settings, and kindly “add” a DNS service which works within the Great Firewall of China. But they seemed to forget that both Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall, at least so far.</p>
<p>Back to the DNS setting code above (line 2090). It makes a binder call to <code>WifiManager.callSECApi()</code>, with message code = 330, with a <code>Bundle</code> setting <code>publicDnsServer</code> to our friend <code>114.114.114.114</code>. While <code>WifiManager</code> is a standard Android class the method <code>callSECApi()</code>, as suggested by its name, is Samsung specific.</p>
<p>The remote call to <code>WifiManager</code> would end up in the service class implementation at <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiServiceImpl</code>, implementing WifiService, at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiServiceImpl.java">WifiServiceImpl.java</a>. (The class is Samsung’s extension to the AOSP service class of the same …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Twice a day, we peak in intellectual performance. We can improve our productivity by understanding the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></p>
<h3><span id="Circadian_graph_and_brainwork">Circadian graph and brainwork</span></h3>
<p>Charting the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> makes it possible to find the best windows of time for brainwork. The <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> graph below was generated with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> using a log of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a>. In the graph, two yellow bands indicate the optimum time for brainwork. The exact timing may differ for each individual. However, the blocks can be easily determined:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Morning block</b>: soon after waking, after morning coffee, or after breakfast. The best brain slot may last 2-4 hours. If you are sleepy in the morning see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">Natural creativity cycle</a></li>
<li> <b>Evening block</b>: soon after <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. The second best brain slot may last 2-4 hours as well. If you do not nap, you may not fully benefit from that block (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Power_nap" title="Power nap">Power nap</a>). If you are sleepy during this slot see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping" title="Best time for napping">Best time for napping</a></li></ol>
<p>The graph explains the reasons for which the two brainwork blocks emerge:

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> <b>Optimizing the timing of brainwork with respect to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></b>. This graph was generated with the help of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> on the basis of 3-year-long daily measurements of a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> rhythm. The horizontal axis expresses the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_phase" title="Circadian phase">number of hours from awakening</a> (note that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free-running_sleep" title="Free-running sleep">free-running sleep</a> cycle period may be longer than 24 hours). <span>Light blue dots</span> are actual sleep episode measurements with timing on the horizontal, and the length on the left vertical axis. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">Homeostatic</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as the <b>ability to initiate sleep</b>. Percent of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>blue line</span> (right-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Adenosine-related <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic_sleep_propensity" title="Homeostatic sleep propensity">homeostatic sleep propensity</a> increases in proportion to mental effort and can be partially cleared by caffeine, stress, etc. <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">Circadian</a></b> sleepiness can roughly be expressed as <b>the ability to maintain sleep</b>. Average length of the initiated sleep episodes is painted as a thick <span>red line</span> (left-side calibrations of the vertical axis). Mid-day slump in alertness is also circadian, but is biologically different and results in short sleep that does not register as a red peak. <b>Sleep maintenance</b> circadian component correlates (1) negatively with core body temperature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine">catecholamines</a>, and (2) positively with: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Melatonin" title="Melatonin">melatonin</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/REM_sleep" title="REM sleep">REM sleep</a> propensity. <b>Optimum timing of brainwork</b> requires both (1) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> sleepiness, and (2) low <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleepiness. There are two high quality alertness blocks during the day: the first after the awakening, and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. Both blocks are marked as <span>yellow</span> bands below the graph. For best learning, and for best <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>, use these two <span>yellow blocks</span> of time. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Caffeine" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a> can only be used to enhance alertness early in the optimum brainwork window (<span>brown</span>). Later use will affect sleep (caffeine half-life is about six hours). Optimum timing of exercise is not marked as it may vary depending on the optimum timing of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Zeitgeber" title="Zeitgeber">zeitgebers</a> (e.g. early morning for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> people and evening for ASPS people).

<h3><span id="Best_brainwork_time">Best brainwork time</span></h3>
<p>The optimum timing of brainwork requires both high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> alertness and high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> alertness. There are two quality alertness blocks during the day: the first occurs after awakening and the second after the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a> period. Both are marked as <span>yellow blocks</span> in the graph (above). For best learning and best creative results, use these yellow blocks for brainwork. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine" title="Factors that affect sleep"><span>Caffeine</span></a> can only be used to enhance alertness early in this optimum window. Later use will affect sleep (the half-life of caffeine is about six hours). The optimum timing of exercise may vary depending on your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Exercise" title="Factors that affect sleep">exercise</a> goals and the optimum timing of zeitgebers (e.g. early morning for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> people and evening for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> people). In this example, the <span>stress block</span> is followed by the <span>exercise block</span> to counterbalance the hormonal and neural effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a> before the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_valve" title="Stress valve">Stress valves</a>). Unmarked white areas can be used for the lunch (before siesta) and fun time unrelated to work in the evening at a time when the ascending <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleepiness makes creative work ineffective. That white evening protective zone should be free from stress, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Alcohol" title="Factors that affect sleep">alcohol</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine" title="Factors that affect sleep">caffeine</a>, etc. Recommended activities might include fun games, relaxation, TV, reading, family-time, DIY, housework, etc. For inveterate workaholics, less challenging and stress-free jobs might also work ok. 
</p>
<p><b>The best test for a well designed day is that all activities <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning" title="Pleasure of learning">should be fun</a>!</b></p> 
<p>Brainwork is fun only if your brain is ready. Sleep is fun if you are ready. Rest and entertainment feel right only after a productive day. Even a bit of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> can be fun if it is properly dosed and timed. You do not need to be an adrenaline junkie to enjoy your stress and exercise slots. There is little exaggeration in saying that <b>a good understanding of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> is the key to a happy and productive day!</b> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_happy_life" title="Formula for happy life">Formula for happy life</a>).
</p>
<p>Happy and productive life is best achieved by adhering to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a></p>
<h3><span id="Natural_creativity_cycle">Natural creativity cycle</span></h3>
<p>In addition to the variables of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a>, the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a> employs the fact that the neocortex operates in several modes determined by local fatigue, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creative meandering</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. During the day, natural transitions from high focus to distraction, to high creativity, and to rest will occur in proportion to the engagement of individual areas of the cortex. It will depend on the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_map" title="Concept map">concept maps</a> involved in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mental_computation" title="Mental computation">mental computation</a>, and the overall neural activation. At night, the brain will proceed with natural <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization" title="Memory optimization">memory optimization</a> by sequentially switching between <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/NREM" title="NREM">NREM</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/REM" title="REM">REM</a> sleep modes.
</p>
<p>All brainwork should be based on self-regulation and natural transitions to high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a> and/or rest. All forms of artificial control will increase the fatigue and reduce the productivity</p>

<h3><span id="Balanced_24_hour_cycle">Balanced 24 hour cycle</span></h3>
<p>The <span>slanting green line</span> separates the graph into the areas of phase advanced (right) and phase delays (left). The line is determined by points in the graph where the waking time (horizontal axis) added to the sleep time (left vertical axis) equals to 24.0 hours. The place where the <span>green breakeven line</span> crosses the <span>red sleep length line</span> determines the optimum balanced sleep cycle of 24 hours. In the presented example, 17.35 hours of waking, added to the expected 6.65 hours of sleep time complete a balanced full 24 hours sleep-wake cycle. The greater the angle between the <span>green</span> and <span>red</span> lines, the harder it is to balance sleep and fit it into the 24h cycle of the rotating earth. In the example, adding waking hours does not shorten sleep much enough to make the balance easy. This implies that a religious adherence to a 17.35 day may be necessary to balance the cycle. However, this shortened waking day may increase <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_latency" title="Sleep latency">sleep latency</a> and increase the probability of premature awakening, which can also tip the balance towards the phase delay. The <span>vertical aqua line</span> shows where the expected sleep time added to the waking time equals to 24 hours (crossover with the <span>green line</span> representing a perfect 24-hour day). In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> or <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> that 24h balance may be hard to accomplish. For example, without medical intervention, only a large protective zone in the evening, early nap (or no nap), and intense morning exercise can help balance the day in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a>.
</p><p><b>Important!</b> This graph is based on data that is true solely for a free running sleep condition. If you use an alarm clock to regulate the timing of your sleep, these measurements and recommendations may not apply! In addition, the timing and amplitude of changes differ vastly between individuals!
</p>
<h2><span id="Sleeping_against_your_natural_rhythm">Sleeping against your natural rhythm</span></h2>
<p>If you sleep against your natural rhythm you will often experience tiredness or drowsiness that can be resolved by adjusting the sleeping hours. In healthy individuals, the daytime alertness is primarily determined by:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_sleep" title="Two components of sleep">circadian phase and homeostatic sleepiness</a></li>
<li> total sleep time the night before</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#NREM_and_memory" title="Memory optimization in sleep">amount of slow-wave sleep the night before</a></li>
<li> regular adherence to the sleep-wake schedule in preceding days</li>
<li> sleep deficits accumulated in the preceding days (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#REM_rebound_hypothesis" title="How do we fall asleep?">REM deficit</a>, SWA deficit, etc.)</li></ol>
<p>All those factors are closely associated with the sleep phase. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep" title="Formula for good sleep: free running sleep">Free running sleep</a> provides the best way to maximize alertness throughout a waking day. Free running sleep is likely to shift the minimum temperature point from the early morning closer towards the middle of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subjective_night" title="Subjective night">subjective night</a>. You should notice <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">increased sleepiness before going to sleep</a> and no <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_inertia" title="Sleep inertia">sleep inertia</a> upon awakening! If you cannot free-run your sleep, it is very important to understand the relationship between your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleep drives as compiled in the table below. In the course of the day, you should move in sync between the yellow areas of the table, i.e. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#Sleep-wake_flip-flop" title="How do we fall asleep?">from perfect alertness to maximum sleepiness, and then back to perfect alertness</a>. The gray areas illustrate when your sleep falls out of sync:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>High circadian sleepiness
</td>
<td>Low circadian sleepiness
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>High homeostatic sleepiness
</td>
<td><b>Peak of the night</b>: You are very drowsy and fall into refreshing sleep with latency of less than five minutes
</td>
<td><b>Insomnia</b>: You are tossing and turning in bed. You are very tired but you cannot fall asleep. Your temperature, blood pressure and pulse are raised. Your thoughts are racing
<p><b>Solution</b>: Wait for the arrival of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> phase. Delay going to sleep by 3-6 hours
</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody><caption>
</caption>
<tbody><tr><td>Low homeostatic sleepiness
</td>
<td><b>Hypersomnia</b>: You are drowsy throughout the day despite long sleep hours. Napping does not help. You show minimum energy levels. Your muscles are weak and atonic
<p><b>Solution</b>: Adjust your sleep phase to your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> (e.g. try to go to sleep 3-6 hours later)
</p>
</td>
<td><b>Peak of the day</b>: You are alert, energetic, and full of new ideas

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>Where we are</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">published an article in CoinDesk</a> about using crypto to secure our elections. You can read and discuss more on this forum in <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/can-crypto-save-our-elections/885">part 1</a> and <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/how-to-safeguard-elections-with-crypto/886">part 2</a> that go into some detail about how crypto-powered voting would work, and why it would solve many problems that we face today.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Intercoin started building <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/c/applications/14">applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform</a>. While it’s not scalable enough to power <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/crypto-not-scalable-enough-to-be-money-cointelegraph">everyday money</a> or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/ethereum-scalability-viability">massive elections</a>, perhaps Ethereum 2.0 (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-comprehensive-view-of-ethereum-2-0-serenity-5865ad8b7c62">Serenity</a>) will one day become scalable enough that these smart contracts can see wider adoption, even without having to migrate to the Intercoin back-end platform.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Intercoin is planning to release its own Intercoin App in the app stores, and turn <a href="http://intercoin.org/">intercoin.org</a> into a web-based portal that will let anyone with a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Chrome Extension</a> to deploy the smart contracts we developed, invite friends from their contact list, and manage their community together. We also plan to roll out the Intercoin Crypto Show to teach people more about crypto and smart contracts. In the meantime, if you have questions, feel free to ask them in this forum.</p>
<p><strong>Start of the Art in Crypto Voting</strong></p>
<p>For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology. There have been early experiments in Russia running elections on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moscows-blockchain-voting-system-cracked-a-month-before-election/">Ethereum</a> as well as proprietary platforms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/russia-vote-blockchain">Waves</a>. It’s still early, but we will see tremendous growth in the coming years.</p>
<p>What if people could vote securely online? Then they would be able to make decisions collectively about a variety of things. Technology can lower the cost of running a secure election, and make it available to any organization, large or small. But who can vote, and when? How do we know that it will be secure? Below, we explore exactly these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Vote?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in democratic elections is determining who can vote, and ensuring that everyone has an equal amount of say. There needs to be some process in place to make sure people don’t create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack#:~:text=In%20a%20Sybil%20attack%2C%20the,diagnosed%20with%20dissociative%20identity%20disorder.">multiple identities</a> to cheat the system. This is accomplished by voter registration, which itself has controversial issues like purging <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-rights/-use-it-or-lose-it---the-problem-of-purges-from-the-registration0/">inactive voters</a> and <a>disadvantaged voters</a> and other ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States#Disparate_impact">disenfranchising voters</a> from even having their voice heard in the election.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will come up with better solutions for voter registration, but – for now – this step will have to be done via some established process that a community has. We have deployed the <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">CommunityContract</a> specifically to give communities the ability to determine who can vote, and who can’t.</p>
<p><strong>When Can They Vote?</strong></p>
<p>In the USA, voting normally takes place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)">Election Day</a>, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Some states allow early voting, so people can cast ballots before Election Day.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=212">how polling is better than elections</a>. What I meant is that, expecting the entire population to turn out for an election on a specific day will lead to problems with voter turnout. Having a referendum where only 20% of people vote can cast doubt on the legitimacy of whether the outcome faithfully represents the will of the overall population, or just those who bothered to show up. For example, Puerto Rico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum#:~:text=A%20referendum%20on%20the%20political,overwhelmingly%20chose%20statehood%20by%2097%25.">voted in 2017 to join the United States</a> by an overwhelming 97%, but that is partly due to a boycott by the opposition, who didn’t show up to vote, resulting in a 22.93% turnout. Opinion polls, on the other hand, show 52% support for joining the United States – a majority to be sure, but nowhere near as overwhelming, and possibly within a margin of error.</p>
<p>Polling vs Elections is less about who can vote, but rather about <em>when</em>. You can have a poll take place over a 5 year period, and in any given window of time, a certain small, random representative sample is able to vote. Any given participant can vote at most once in that rolling window, before it moves on to others. Participants can also fail to cast a vote, which is similar to sitting out an election, but at least timing of the eligibility window would be randomized for everyone, and can be lengthened to several days, removing major impediments to voting. Of course, all these parameters are customizable, and letting 100% of the people vote 100% of the time throughout the poll is just like a regular election.</p>
<p>People without a phone or active notifications would be underrepresented, but presumably, those who opted into elections and polls conducted with digital technology, especially about smart contract issues, would take care to have them turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting Voters</strong></p>
<p>Each block in Ethereum has a hash of all transactions it contains, and it is pretty much impossible to control this hash without controlling a majority of mining power on the network. Moreover, controlling this hash would only allow one to possibly control the outcome of a tiny window in a single given election. A lot of effort resulting in almost no vandalism.</p>
<p>It is possible for smart contracts to use the <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11455/inside-a-smart-contract-is-it-possible-to-get-latest-mined-blocks-number-and-i">hashes from previously mined blocks</a> as a “random” seed (better to call “uncontrolled” seed). Based on this seed, we can select <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">members of the voting community</a> who are eligible to vote in any given block, by calling:</p>
<pre>eligible(address, blockNumber)
</pre>
<p>Blocks can go by pretty fast, and someone eligible to vote in block M could be eligible to vote in blocks M+1, M+2, …, M+N. Actually, rather than base it on block number, we use <em>timestamps</em>. That’s because we can’t rely on how quickly blocks will be mined, especially <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/200/19734">after Ethereum Serenity 2.0 rolls out</a>. Timestamps may sometimes be off by 2 hours or so (if miners are malicious) but this shouldn’t seriously affect the window in a biased way if we’re talking about random samples and polling windows that last several days.</p>
<p>Periodically, the Intercoin app (or another dapp) running on one or more servers somewhere can watch the <code>VotingContract</code> on the blockchain and find out if the user has recently become eligible to vote in the poll. It then sends a notification, sms or email to the user, with a link to the poll. Upon receiving it, the user would typically have a bunch of time to visit the link and cast their vote. Rather than having the smart contract waste gas looping through a ton of previous block hashes and execute the <code>eligible()</code> function, the client dapp interface helpfully submits the <code>blockNumber</code> together with the vote. The smart contract them simply verifies the eligibility before allowing the vote to proceed.</p>
<p>The <code>eligible()</code> function takes into account <code>blockNumber</code>, but also the <code>memberCount</code> from <code>CommunityContract</code> and <code>fraction</code> of them that can vote in any given window. The <code>eligible()</code> function must be continuous in the latter two variables, since e.g. <code>memberCount</code> of a community can change between the time the user learns they can vote, and then when their transaction is finally mined.</p>
<p><strong>What Can They Vote For?</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>VotingContract</code> is designed to be a general-purpose smart contract, to work with many types of elections, referendums, and polls. Those who are eligible to vote will call:</p>
<pre><code>contract VotingContract {
   address externalContract;
   address externalMethod;
   uint fraction; // eligible people to vote in any given window, out of 1e10
   uint minimum; // minimum number of eligible people in any window

   function vote(VotingData data, uint eligibleBlock) {
     if (eligible(msg.sender)
     &amp;&amp; !hasVotedSince(msg.sender, eligibleBlock)) {
        // valid vote as far as eligibility and voting once
        // but external contract might roll back this transaction
        // if the vote contains invalid data, for instance
        externalContract.call(
          abi.encodeWithSignature(
             concat(externalMethod, "(uint256,uint256)"), 
             data
          )
        );
     }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>VotingData</code> is a <code>struct</code> that can contain arbitrary properties, which are interpreted by the <code>externalMethod</code> of the <code>externalContract</code>, which may choose to <code>rollback()</code> the transaction. It is not the business of <code>VotingContract</code> about <em><strong>how</strong></em> the vote is interpreted. It may be tallied in various ways (First past the post, <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-versus-irv/">ranked choice, approval vote</a>) and it may be a vote among two or more candidates (although for more than two, keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</a>). For example, the <code>IncomeContract</code> can use the <code>VotingContract</code> and <code>CommunityContract</code> to allow a community to vote on whether the level of UBI should go up or down by 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The set of threat profiles for an election or poll differs from, say, a banking app. Although both require security, in the banking app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are managing relatively large amounts of money which are dear to them, and therefore take care to make sure their transaction was properly executed</li>
<li>people use the app that the bank releases, cryptographically signs and distributes on the app store or the web through https</li>
<li>people trust the bank and the bank is prepared to reverse individual transactions through chargebacks and fraud investigations</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, with a voting app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are casting one vote in a sea of votes, and it won’t harm them much if only their transaction was executed incorrectly, so most won’t check</li>
<li>if everyone used a particular app to cast their vote, the creator of the app could be compromised, and no one voter would be incentivized to check</li>
<li>people trust a system consisting of multiple actors, which is not prepared to let only some people recast their votes and not others</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of 1 and 2 with voting means that most people won’t bother to check that their vote was properly recorded, and even if they do, they won’t know about everyone else whose vote may have been recorded incorrectly. A malicious actor could create a voting app that a large portion of the community ends up using, and this voting app might <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV_c1-YTk8M">switch the …</a></p></div></div>

Experienced Python developers might recognize some of them. However, others will still be unknown. Regardless, I find all of them very cool.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="yc4ulma"><code>...</code></h2>
<p>Yes, you’re reading it right, <code>...</code> is a valid construct in Python. <code>...</code> is a singleton object called <code>Ellipsis</code>. If you type it into the Python interpreter, you can actually see it:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>...
<span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">official docs</a> , <code>Ellipsis</code> is a "special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.". There’s two major use cases for it. One is to serve as a placeholder body in an empty function. The other is on <code>Numpy</code>, as a slice item, just as described in the docs.</p>
<h3 id="function-placeholder">Function Placeholder</h3>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Beware, I'm not saying that <code>pass</code> == <code>...</code>, I'm just saying that as a function body, the outcome is the same. In fact, you can use anything as placeholder.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>"An empty, but also awesome function"</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="numpy">Numpy</h3>

<h2 id="an-elegant-unpacking">An Elegant Unpacking</h2>
<p>Iterable unpacking is a remarkably convenient feature and has been there for a while. Most people use it to unpack iterables with multiple items. As example, consider the following use cases.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, *b, c = range(<span>1</span>, <span>11</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
[<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Or just:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, b, c = range(<span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>2</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But one nice use case that many people do not take advantage of is unpacking a single iterable. Why this is useful? It makes the code a little bit more elegant, IMHO.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = lst[<span>0</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>(a, ) = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>[a] = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I know that it may seem silly, but at least to me, it looks more elegant.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-flat-this-list">Can You Flat This List?</h2>
<p>Flattening a list can be done in several ways. The simplest one is using list comprehension. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>], [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened = [elem <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> l <span>for</span> elem <span>in</span> sublist]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're more inclined to functional programming, you can use a reducer.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> reduce
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>reduce(<span>lambda</span> x,y: x+y,l)
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>However, there's yet another way. You can use the <code>sum</code> function!</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, [])
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>This works because the <code>sum</code> function iterates through each element in the list and concatenates them with the default value you pass as the second argument. Since lists in Python can be concatenated with <code>+</code> operator, then you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, []) ==&gt; [] + [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>] + [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>] + [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Even though this trick is brilliant, it’s by no means readable. Also, it has a terrible performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we do this with string?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Python forbids doing the same with strings, even though you can concatenated strings with <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = [<span>"abc"</span>, <span>"def"</span>, <span>"ghf"</span>]

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(s, <span>""</span>)

<h2 id="the">The <code>_</code></h2>
<p>This one is really interesting and very handy when working with the REPL. It not only works with the default Python interpreter, but with IPython as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you run an expression in the REPL, Python binds the output to the <code>_</code> variable. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>nums = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>7</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(nums)
<span>11</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>_
<span>11</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>_</code> is a variable like any other, you can re-bind it, or do anything else with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>9</span> + _
<span>20</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = _
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>20</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-else">What <code>else</code>?</h2>
<p>The <code>else</code> statement in can serve several purposes. Few people know, but you can use it outside the classical ‘if else` block. Python allow it to be used on loops and also on exception blocks.</p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>Python has two different loops, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>. Both of them can be "broken". That is, if a certain condition is met, we can break out of the loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>7</span>]: <span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
   ...:     <span>if</span> a == <span>3</span>:
   ...:         print(<span>"a == 3. exiting loop."</span>)
   ...:         <span>break</span>
   ...:     a += <span>1</span>
   ...: 
a == <span>3.</span> exiting loop.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's say that we are looking for a particular condition. If that condition is satisfied, we save the result in a flag called <code>found</code>. Then, if we don't find it, we print a message.</p>
<pre><code>found = <span>False</span>
a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        found = <span>True</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> found:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>a</code> never becomes 12, the program outputs <code>a was never found</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, but how can we use <code>else</code> in this context?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>else</code> can be used to replace the flag. Basically, what we actually want is to run the loop and, if not found, then print a message. This is how it looks like with <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And since it works with any loop, you can use a <code>for</code> instead of <code>while</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> a <span>in</span> range(<span>10</span>):
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>The <code>else</code> in Python is so versatile that you can even use it in a <code>try ... except</code> block. The idea here is to capture a nonoccurrence of an exception. </p>
<pre><code>In [<span>13</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Key <span>is</span> missing
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we try looking up a key named “lala” in an empty dictionary. Since “lala” is not there, the code will raise an <code>KeyError</code> exception. When I run this snippet in <code>IPython</code>, I got an expected result.</p>
<p>What about a case where the program raises no exception?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>14</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {<span>'lala'</span>: <span>'bla'</span>}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Else here
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see it in action. The <code>{’lala’: ‘bla’}[‘lala’]</code> block won’t raise <code>KeyError</code>, so the <code>else</code> comes into play. </p>
<p>Remember, few people know this, so I personally avoid using this feature to not confuse other developers working in the same code base. It’s nice to impress friends, though!</p>
<h2 id="comparing-things-like-a-boss">Comparing Things Like a Boss</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorites and not so hidden, to be honest. Unlike many programming languages, like <code>Java</code>, <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>, Python allows you to chain comparison operators. Let's imagine that you have a variable <code>x</code> that holds the value of <code>10</code>. Now, let's say that you want to assert that <code>x</code> is within a range, like 5..20, inclusive. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>16</span>]: x = <span>10</span>
In [<span>17</span>]: <span>if</span> x &gt;= <span>5</span> <span>and</span> x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out, this can be simplified by chaining the operators. So, we can refactor the code to this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>18</span>]: <span>if</span> <span>5</span> &lt;= x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>This code achieves the exact same result, but it's much more elegant. You can chain using any kind of comparison operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x &gt; <span>1</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x &lt; <span>20</span> &lt; x*<span>10</span> &lt; <span>1000</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Very cool!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s the end of this post. Python is a very friendly language and has some nice, but not well-known, features. In this post, I showed you my favorites and I hope you’ve learned something new. See you next time!</p>

  <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

  <p>An encouraging development in the education of programmers in recent years has been a renewed interest in the relationship between programming, logic and abstract algebra. Recent enthusiasm over functional programming is no doubt the main motivation behind this happy development.</p>

  <p>However, this interest is at times accompanied by a kind of awed appreciation of this relationship, perhaps among practitioner enthusiasts, who consider it almost miraculous, more than among academics. Some researchers notable for popularizing the interest in this relationship encourage this view with talk of “computational trinitarianism” and statements like, “this is further proof that mathematics is discovered rather than invented,” one <a href="http://archive.is/3wgAM">going so far</a> as to call the relationship “a manifestation of the divine” and to say that “all three have ontological force; they codify what is, not how to describe what is already given to us. In this sense they are foundational; if we suppose that they are merely <em>descriptive</em>, we would be left with the question of where these previously given concepts arise, leading us back again to foundations”. Another has <a href="https://vimeo.com/242784236">said</a>,<sup id="fnref:milewski"><a href="#fn:milewski">1</a></sup> “Have you heard of the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism? … These three different theories … were developed separately — constructive logic, typed lambda calculus, and category theory — and the isomorphism says that these are actually <em>identical</em>. Why do these three completely separate theories have the same structure? Because all three of them are about composability.” While he is not too far off the mark when he later says, “Maybe we are just discovering the way our brains work. … [I]f mathematics is all about composition, then composition is something that our brains came up with in order to deal with complexity,” the truth is far simpler yet more interesting, even if less mysterious.</p>

  <p>Awed wonder is a powerful marketing tool, but it mystifies rather than clarifies, and fosters a kind of magical thinking in a field that strives to be most at odds with it (although, as we’ll see in part 2, it sometimes fails). The goal of mathematics is to simplify, not to wow. This attitude towards that — quite obvious, as we’ll see — relationship also distracts from the actual, less obvious, discoveries made. The existence of this relationship was not among them; it was not the denouement — it was the setup. Confusing the two muddles the very essence of any story.</p>

  <p>I also believe that it is this very attitude that puts the focus on the chosen mathematical abstractions rather than on the things they describe creates an atmosphere where there can only be one True interpretation — even one with three personas. I call this absolutist view that confuses the peculiarities of a method of observation with those of the observed system and so denies alternative interpretations the “Protestant” view, and it is a hindrance to understanding logic, where truth is, almost by definition, always relative to a specific system. As Alonzo Church wrote in the very paper he first introduced the λ-calculus<sup id="fnref:church0"><a href="#fn:church0">2</a></sup>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We do not attach any character of uniqueness or absolute truth to any particular system of logic. The entities of formal logic are abstractions, invented because of their use in describing and systematizing facts of experience or observation, and their properties, determined in rough outline by this intended use, depend for their exact character on the arbitrary choice of the inventor… [T]here exist, undoubtedly, more than one formal system whose use as a logic is feasible, and of these systems one may be more pleasing or more convenient than another, but it cannot be said that one is right and the other wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following text will attempt to demistify this relationship between computation, logic and abstract algebra. Category theory is a generalization of the last, but programming languages are sometimes interchangeably assigned to both the second, logic, and the first, computation, thus adding to the confusion. In my view, programming languages (at least when studied in a theoretical context) strictly belong to the second persona of logic, and not at all to the first, computation, other than by virtue of the ordinary relationship between the three; programming languages are no more related to computation than formal logic is. I <a href="https://pron.github.io/posts/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation">have previously written</a> about the distinction between programming and computation and the misunderstanding caused by confusing the two, and I hope that this text will clarify the matter further.</p>

  <p>While I will not opine on whether or not mathematical objects have “an ontological force”, as the Platonic ontology of mathematics is a matter of debate in the philosophy of mathematics — a fascinating field, but not a focus of this discussion — I will show that they are not only very much descriptive, but that <em>what</em> they attempt to describe, and therefore how they arise, has been explicitly stated by the originators of those ideas. There is nothing incidental, miraculous, surprising or “divine” in the relationship between computation, logic and algebra; rather, nothing is more creatively human than the process that led to their correlation, and while some things in mathematics are perhaps discovered, logic and algebra were <em>invented</em>, and rather than carrying an independent “foundational ontological force”, they were devised to <em>describe</em> a physical phenomenon (although I do not claim that the mathematical systems invented may not <em>also</em> correspond to some Truth). In particular, I will show that computation, logic and algebra were studied as a single subject for most of their relevant history, related in the following way: human reason works by computation, logic is a description of the process of reasoning, and algebra is the mathematical modeling of logic. The three began to separate into different disciplines only towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Logic was separated from algebra by Gottlob Frege, immediately triggering the criticism that the correspondence between the two is an argument for having only one. Frege responded that there would <em>obviously</em> be a correspondence between the two because he had invented one to describe the same thing as the other, but that one can translate between two modes of expression does not mean that one of them is redundant. Computation separated from logic some decades later as a more foundational or primitive concept, while exposing the fact that the basic principles of how logic supposedly described human reason — which Gottfried Leibniz called the “Art of Combination” — hadn’t changed for literally millennia, and while logicians/algebraists declared themselves to be studying the computation in the human mind, they were actually just modeling a very particular, and ancient, <em>view</em> of human reason that they had taken on unquestionable faith. The systems were in such harmonious correspondence not just because they described the same physical phenomenon, but because they all <em>re</em>-described the <em>same ancient description</em> of that phenomenon.</p>

  <p>While researching the topic — not being a logician or a historian, but rather a programmer and an amateur interested in the history of mathematics — I was surprised how explicit this connection was made from the very beginning of the disciplines. Quite the opposite of accidental or miraculous, calling this relationship obvious is an <em>understatement</em>. That there is some relationship between a house cat and a leopard can be said to be obvious; the one between the original Star Wars trilogy and its many prequels and sequels is much more than just obvious. If you think that it is in any way accidental or miraculous, or that it is proof that Darth Vader was discovered rather than invented, you are clearly missing something very important in understanding the meta-theory of stories — meaning, how they come to be. I delight at the opportunity to use the history of science — or of logic and mathematics in this case — to clarify the development of mathematical concepts by tracing their evolution and the creative process of their originators.</p>

  <p>This book-length text — and not a short book — is published as a three-part blog post series, but I personally wrote very little of it. While the text is not different in content or conclusions from books about the history of logic and computation (or the wonderful recent Atlantic article, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/"><em>How Aristotle Created the Computer</em></a>), it is certainly different in style, being comprised mostly of original sources. I chose to compose the text in this way for several reasons, listed here in no particular order: 1. I am not a professional historian and do not have sufficient knowledge to provide insight on historical trends. 2. I find reading (carefully selected) primary sources a lot more fun than sweeping descriptions. 3. As most mathematicians and programmers do not make good historians, a lot of inaccuracies and downright mistakes are perpetrated because few have seen the actual sources. 4. As my goal is to demystify logic and mathematics, I think it is especially enlightening to read how the originators of the ideas describe their process of arriving at their insight. My text is also different in focus; it attempts to emphasize the evolution of the connection …</p></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff1f1677bf36496f03d8"><div><p>As most of the major media categories — music, video and video games — have existed for decades, we tend to forget that media is technology. Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an <em>internet</em> <em>streaming </em>music service, while iTunes is a <em>download </em>music service, SiriusXM is <em>satellite</em> <em>broadcast</em> music service, and radio is a <em>terrestrial broadcast</em> technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “<span>outlets</span> or <span>tools</span> used to <span>store</span> and <span>deliver</span> information or data.”</p><p>While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change. </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: How Technology Created Recorded Media, Then Continually Redefined It</strong></p><p>Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602797899091_5458"><div><p>&nbsp;When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.&nbsp;</p><p>This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’ <em>Yesterday </em>and Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em> would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.&nbsp;</p><p>So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track, <em>Old Town Road </em>by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">accents</a>, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –&nbsp; afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/">hottest</a>” each week. According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, both groups had<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/"> reasons to lie</a>. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"> received bribes to play specific tracks</a>, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s <em>N***az4life</em> from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that <em>N***az4life</em> was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <h2>Fun with Combinators</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on October 17, 2020
</p>





<p>There are a bunch of “minimal” computational models out there: Turing machines, lambda calculus, PowerPoint <span data-cites="wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017">(Wildenhain <a href="#ref-wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, etc. These are radically simple languages which are nonetheless Turing complete, so theoretically “as powerful” as each other. Of those, lambda calculus is without question my favourite to actually write programs in: it’s the one which is closest to crawling out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpit</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, though, it is <em>far</em> from simple. Lambda calculus has <em>variables</em>, which introduce huge complexity into the interpreter: especially if you want to do any kind of formal reasoning about programs, this complexity is a problem. We might want to reach for something even lower-level than lambda calculus: this is where combinator calculi come in.</p>
<p>You may have heard of SKI combinator calculus: it’s the “simplest” of the calculi, but it’s not actually very easy to understand, and it’s absolute murder to try use. So we’re going to start with <code>BCKW</code>, a more obscure calculus, actually invented by Haskell Curry.</p>
<p>There are 4 combinators in <code>BCKW</code>: <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code> (shocking, I know). You can think about these combinators as functions which manipulate the beginning of strings:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Kxy  ~&gt; x
Wxy  ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>Let’s work with some examples to get a sense for how these combinators work.</p>
<p>Upper case letters are combinators, lower-case are variables. Yes, yes, I know I said that combinator calculi didn’t need variables, and it doesn’t! I’m just using them here to explain how each of the combinators work. If you really want to be pedantic you can think of the lower case letters as notational placeholders meaning “any given combinator”. They won’t exist in any actual programs we write.</p>
<p>The simplest combinator is <code>K</code>: it’s actually equivalent to the <code>const</code> function from Haskell. It discards its second argument, and returns the first. If you give a combinator more arguments than it usually accepts, you just keep the extra arguments in the output:</p>
<pre><code>Kxyz ~&gt; xz</code></pre>
<p><code>W</code> is the next combinator: it <em>duplicates</em> its second argument.</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>We always start from the <em>left</em>, applying the rule for the left-most combinator first.</p>
<pre><code>WKxyz ~&gt; Kxxyz ~&gt; xyz
KWxyz ~&gt; Wyz   ~&gt; yzz</code></pre>
<p>Next we have <code>C</code>: this is equivalent to the Haskell function <code>flip</code>. It swaps the second and third arguments:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a small little evaluator for expressions which use <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code>. You can edit the expression, and press enter to step through it.</p>



<p>The last combinator introduces parentheses, and it’s equivalent to function composition.</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)</code></pre>
<p>You can write parentheses yourself: implicitly, all expressions are left-associative. That means that the following are all equal:</p>
<pre><code>xyz = (xy)z = (x)yz = ((x)y)z</code></pre>
<p>But <code>xyz</code> is <em>not</em> equal to, say, <code>x(yz)</code>.</p>
<p>And here’s a puzzle to start flexing your combinator skills: one of the combinators in SKI combinator calculus is <code>I</code>, which is the identity function.</p>
<pre><code>Ix ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Try write an expression which functions the same way as <code>I</code>, using only the <code>BCKW</code> combinators. Use the following evaluator to try and figure out how to do it: write an expression after <code>λ&gt;</code> which functions the same as <code>I</code>.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>CK</code> followed by any combinator will do the trick. So <code>CKB</code>, <code>CKK</code>, <code>CKC</code>, etc.
<pre><code>I = CKC</code></pre>
Update 19/10/2020: A few people have pointed out (<a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/">Joachim Breitner</a> was the first) that there is a shorter solution to this problem: <code>WK</code>. I tend to prefer solutions that don’t include <code>W</code>, since then we’re working in a subset of the language that is both terminating and affine; although in this case the reason I didn’t mention <code>WK</code> is that I just didn’t find it myself.
</details>

<p>Each of the combinators we’ve defined so far work a little weird: they seem to skip over their first argument, and work on their second. Indeed, there is another, equivalent combinator calculus which doesn’t have this peculiarity:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Axy  ~&gt; y
Mx   ~&gt; xx
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p><code>B</code> stays the same in this calculus, but the rest of the combinators get switched out for seemingly simpler versions. <code>K</code> goes to <code>A</code><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>Axy ~&gt; y
Kxy ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Which isn’t a huge change. It’s the other two where we see the real difference. <code>W</code> has been swapped out for <code>M</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy
Mx  ~&gt; xx</code></pre>
<p>As you can see <code>W</code> basically does the same thing as <code>M</code>, but while passing through its first argument. The difference between <code>T</code> and <code>C</code> is similar:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p>So, first of all, it is pretty simple to show that <code>BCKW</code> contains all of the <code>BAMT</code> combinators. Try find a way to write <code>T</code> using only <code>BCKW</code> combinators (hint: you might want to use your previous answer for writing <code>I</code> using <code>BCKW</code>).</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> So in fact all of the changed <code>BAMT</code> combinators can be encoded using <code>BCKW</code> by putting <code>I</code> (or <code>CKC</code> or what have you) after the corresponding <code>BCKW</code> combinator. In other words:
<pre><code>T = CI = C(CKC)
A = KI = K(CKC)
M = WI = W(CKC)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>It’s pretty easy to go from <code>BCKW</code> to <code>BAMT</code>, then. However, it’s <em>extremely</em> difficult to go the other way. Here, try to write <code>K</code> in terms of <code>BAMT</code> (this is quite difficult, do not expect to get it!):</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> Either of the following would work:
<pre><code>B(TA)(BBT)
B(B(TA)B)T</code></pre>
</details>
<p>So this is why we will stick to <code>BCKW</code> for the time being: <code>BAMT</code> is just too painful to use.</p>

<p>One of the things <code>BCKW</code> has over <code>SKI</code> is that each combinator represents a concrete capability. <code>K</code> and <code>W</code> especially: without these combinators, we can neither duplicate nor discard variables. This makes the languages without one or both of these interesting (albeit not Turing-complete).</p>
<p>If we say that we can’t use <code>W</code>, we know that the will not duplicate any input. In fact, encoded appropriately, we know that the program can only decrease its size through execution. The <code>BCK</code> system is in fact an encoding of <em>affine</em> logic, which is all the rage nowadays. Rust uses affine types to guarantee memory safety: by preventing duplication of references, you can know that whenever you’re looking at a variable you’re free to modify it, or destroy it if necessary (obviously Rust is a bit more complex than what I’ve described here, but <code>BCK</code> is indeed the fundamental basis for the system in the same way that <code>SK</code> can be the basis for any programming language).</p>
<p>If we remove <code>K</code> as well we have a <em>linear</em> language. This is even more restrictive, but is also quite actively researched at the moment: linear types have been used to construct languages for differential privacy, for instance.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue with <code>BC</code>: it doesn’t (strictly speaking) have an equivalent to <code>I</code>. You can write an expression which is <em>close</em>, but it will only actually compute when applied to at least 3 arguments. See if you can find it.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>BCC</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Usually we add <code>I</code>, though, to give us <code>BCI</code>.</p>

<p><code>S</code> is the only combinator we haven’t seen yet. It’s kind of a combination of <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>W</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Sxyz ~&gt; xz(yz)</code></pre>
<p>It does parenthesising, reordering, <em>and</em> duplication. This allows it to be powerful to be Turing complete only with the addition of <code>K</code>. Try first to construct <code>I</code> given only <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>SK</code> followed by any combinator will suffice.
<pre><code>I = SKK = SKS</code></pre>
</details>
<p>And now construct <code>S</code> from <code>BCKW</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Of course, to show that <code>SK</code> is universal we’d need to show that it contains one of the other universal systems. We won’t do that exhaustively here, but first just try to figure out <code>B</code> and <code>W</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>B = S(KS)K</code></pre>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = SS(SK) = SS(KI)</code></pre>
</details>

<p>The next task is to encode the <code>Y</code> combinator. This is a combinator that evaluates to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Yf ~&gt; f(Yf)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it encodes <em>recursion</em>. Like the <code>fix</code> function in Haskell, this combinator allows us to do recursion without explicit self-reference. And, of course, we can define this combinator using the combinators we’ve seen before, since our language is Turing complete. One encoding is <code>BM(CBM)</code>:</p>



<p>As you can see, <code>BM(CBM)</code>, when applied to <code>f</code>, yields <code>f(M(CBMf))</code>, which is equivalent to <code>f(BM(CBM)f)</code> (the <code>B</code> just hasn’t been applied inside the <code>f</code>). So this is indeed a proper recursion combinator.</p>

<p>Let’s try doing a little bit of programming with these combinators now.</p>
<p>In the lambada calculus, to encode numbers we often use the <em>church</em> numerals: that’s what we’re going to do here, too. A church numeral representing some number <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> is a function which takes two arguments, and applies the first argument to the second <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> times. Here are some church numerals in Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>zero :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
zero f x = x

one :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
one f x = f x

two :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
two f x = f (f x)

three :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
three f x = f (f (f x))</code></pre>
<p>Encoding these numerals in combinators is a little more difficult. Zero and one are obvious: they are <code>A</code> and <code>I</code>, respectively. Try to figure out two and three:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>WB</code>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>SB(WB)</code>
</details>
<p>It turns out that it’s pretty easy to encode numbers in a relatively small amount of space, using a binary encoding. First, multiplication on Church numerals is simply composition: so that’s <code>B</code> on our combinators. We already have 2 defined, so the next thing we need for a binary encoding is a successor function. And we know what <em>that</em> is, from the answer to 3!</p>
<p>This means we can encode normal number in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mo>log</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math> space (although it still takes linear time to evaluate). The following repl allows for numbers:</p>


<p>We could take up even less space if we allowed for non-normal forms. 4, for instance, could be encoded like so:</p>
<pre><code>M(WB)</code></pre>
<p>But we generally prefer to keep our encodings in normal form: otherwise there’s some extra evaluation we have to pay for when we go to use them.</p>

<p>Once upon a time SKI combinators were used as a target for functional compilers: Miranda, Haskell’s precursor, compiled down to a set of combinators which included <code>SKI</code>. Nowadays, Haskell is compiled to the “spineless tagless G-machine”: its compilation technique took over from combinators in the late 80s, and has been the dominant form since. Apparently the reason is that, on the current architecture of most computers, combinator-based compilation targets just aren’t fast enough. They generate too much garbage: as a result, …</p></div></div>

			<p>Following <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a> on forcing Mainland China DNS service upon Hong Kong WiFi users, this part analyzes how the periodic DNS queries on <code>qq.com</code>, as seen by users capturing the DNS queries, are generated from the recent Samsung phones firmware (as at Sept 2020) when WiFi is used.</p>

<blockquote><p>tl;dr: These queries are sent simultaneously to all DNS servers registered for the WiFi connection, including <code>114.114.114.114</code> when it is added under circumstances as examined in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a>. They are generated every 20 to 60 seconds (depending on settings and link conditions) when the following pre-conditions are satisfied, i.e. WiFi is connected (except with some known devices) with <code>mCurrentMode</code> not equals 0 (elaborated at the bottom of this article), and when screen is on.&nbsp; The queries are sent directly using the WiFi connection link, without going through the VPN / private DNS configured, presumably as they are intended for testing the WiFi network.&nbsp; The IP addresses returned by the queries are not further used, except for checking if they are in a private IP range (in which case the checking is deemed failed).</p></blockquote>
<p>The following is a technical (read: very boring) account of the findings. Jump to the end for hints to disable the DNS query for your home WiFi.</p>
<p>For better illustration of the source, a new Github repository showing the decompiled version of the same <code>wifi-service.jar</code> as in Part I has been created. It uses a different mode of the decompiler (JADX) to attempt to decompile more code to Java, even when there are issues in correctness. The repository is at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1">SM-N9750-TGY-1</a>.</p>
<h3>The main players</h3>
<p>The main controlling class for the logic is again under <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>.</p>
<p>As briefly mentioned in the last part, this class implements a state machine which represents the status of the WiFi connection being monitored. The states accept messages and respond to them by taking actions and / or transition into another state.</p>
<p>Separately, a subclass, <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, is responsible for the monitoring of the connectivity and signal strength. The analyzer is an Android <code>Handler</code> which consumes messages in an event loop. These messages can be sent by the parent state machine, from within the analyzer itself, or from other subclasses, to control the activities of the analyzer.</p>
<p>The most relevant messages in our context are defined as follows (unless otherwise specified, the line numbers are those of the <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a> file in the decompiled code):</p>
<p>Messages sent to the Analyzer to control the lifecycle of the checking loop (lines 115-117, 254):</p>
<pre>    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL = 135221;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_START = 135219;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP = 135220;
     ...
    private static final int NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS = 135223;
</pre>
<p>Messages representing external events sent to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine (lines 205-206).</p>
<pre>    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_OFF = 135177;
    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_ON = 135176;
</pre>
<h3>Let the query loop start</h3>
<p>When the phone screen is turned on, Android will send the <code>android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON</code> intent to the network receiver of this class (line 1149), which will in turn send <code>EVENT_SCREEN_ON</code> to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine. If the state is under <code>EvaluatedState</code> [Note 1], the <code>processMessage()</code> method, around line 2138, handles the message (for brevity, some reference to <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> in the code is omitted):</p>
<pre>    
case EVENT_SCREEN_ON:  //135176 
...
if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    sendMessage(obtainMessage(135188 /* CMD_RSSI_FETCH */, mRssiFetchToken, 0) ;
    if (isValidState() &amp;&amp; getCurrentState() != mLevel2State) {
        if (mNetworkStatsAnalyzer != null) {
            mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START); // 135219
        }
        startEleCheck();
    }
    if (mCurrentMode == 1 || mLinkDetectMode == 1) {
        sendMessage(obtainMessage(CMD_TRAFFIC_POLL/*135193*/, mTrafficPollToken, 0);
    }
}
...
</pre>
<p>This means that, when <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, WiFi is connected, and the connection is not with some known devices, it will send the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> message to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. (It will also perform other actions, like calling <code>startEleCheck()</code> to discover devices, but these are not relevant to our context.)</p>
<p>The message <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> from a few other places. Here is an extract of the <code>enter()</code> method of the <code>Valid</code> state, triggered when <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> enters <code>Valid</code> state (i.e. upon WiFi connection) (line 3077-).</p>
<pre>if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    ...
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START);
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS);
}</pre>
<p><code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent when <code>mCurrentMode</code> switches from 0 to other values under <code>Valid</code> state (line 3112).&nbsp; Together, it is ensured that all paths arriving at the status, i.e. Wifi is connected, screen is on, and <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, will trigger <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>.</p>
<p>Note that upon entering the <code>Valid</code> state, <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. Let’s look at what this message does first.</p>
<h3>The NetworkStatsAnalyzer</h3>
<h4>The “loop” structure</h4>
<p>The below shows a skeleton of the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> handler loop handling the above messages, with bodies of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> and <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP</code> omitted for the moment. (lines 4157-, 4477-, 5107-)</p>
<pre>private class NetworkStatsAnalyzer extends Handler
{
    ...
    private boolean mDnsInterrupted = false;
    private boolean mDnsQueried = false;
    private long mLastDnsCheckTime = 0;
    private boolean mPollingStarted = false;
    private boolean mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
    private boolean mSkipRemainingDnsResults = false;
    
    ...
    public void handleMessage(Message string) {
        long now = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final long elapsedRealtime = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final WifiInfo wifiInfo = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.syncGetCurrentWifiInfo();
        final int what = string.what;
        switch (what) {
        ...
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_START:
                if (this.mPollingStarted) break;
                if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) break;
                if (this.isBackhaulDetectionEnabled()) {
                    this.sendEmptyMessage(TCP_BACKHAUL_DETECTION_START); // 135226
                }
                this.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
                WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.initNetworkStatHistory();
                this.mLastRssi = wifiInfo.getRssi();
                this.mPollingStarted = true;
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
                ...
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP:
                ...
                break;
            case NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS:
                if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) {
                    checkPublicDns();
                }
                break;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The message <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code>, sent upon WiFi connection, will invoke the method <code>checkPublicDns()</code> if the WiFi is not a mobile hotspot. The method is as follows (line 4262-).</p>
<pre>public void checkPublicDns() {
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
        mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
        return;
    }
    mPublicDnsCheckProcess = true;
    mNsaQcStep = 1;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor wifiConnectivityMonitor = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this;
    String str = wifiConnectivityMonitor.mParam.DEFAULT_URL_STRING;
    DnsThread mDnsThread = new DnsThread(true, str, this, 10000);
    mDnsThread.start();
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID = mDnsThread.getId();
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.DBG) {
        Log.d(TAG, "wait publicDnsThread results [" + WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID + "]");
    }
}</pre>
<p>We see the problematic <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> method as discussed in Part I being used. It can be seen that the above code handles the “normal” case outside China. Upon WiFi connection, it will start an asynchronous DNS query in a separate thread called <code>DnsThread</code>, using the address in the constant <code>DEFAULT_URL_STRING</code> (hardcoded to “www.google.com” as shown in Part I). This is done once at the start of every WiFi connection. However, if <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> returns true, e.g. in the case of a phone in Hong Kong, it would just set the flag <code>mPublicDnsCheckProcess</code> to false and return, skipping the DNS query for google.</p>
<p>Then we look at <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>. On receipt of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>, the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, among other actions, sends the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> message to itself, and sets the flag <code>mPollingStarted</code> to true. This would kick start the checking loop, as to be explained below. Before taking these actions, it would ensure that the loop is not already started by checking <code>mPollingStarted</code>, and that the WiFi connection is not acting as a hotspot.</p>
<p>The main flow controlling logic of the body of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> polling loop is as follows (line 4509-).</p>
<pre>case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.SMARTCM_DBG) {
    Log.i(TAG, "mPollingStarted : " + mPollingStarted);    
}
if (!mPollingStarted) {
    break;
}
if ((WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != null) &amp;&amp;
    (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mEmptyBssid)) {
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mIWCChannel.sendMessage(CMD_IWC_ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL); // 135376
    int rssi2 = wifiInfo.getRssi();
    if (rssi2 &lt; -90) {
        if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mClientModeImpl.isConnected()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "already disconnected : " + rssi2);
            removeMessages(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
            sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP);
            break;
        }
        if (rssi2 &lt; -95) {
            if (rssi2 == -127) break;
           …</pre></div></div></article></div></div>

What if I maintained a Set of IDs that belong to open conversations for each support channel? <br></p><p>All I have to do now is this: On every conversation update, if status is open, I add that conversation ID to the Set and I remove it from the Set if status is closed.<br></p><p>This Set would be stored on the RAM of course and yes it would take up more memory than storing just a single count for every support channel but all we are doing is storing IDs and not the entire data object so it would hardly cost much in terms of memory.<br></p><p>How does this help with the problem? Well, if you want the count of open conversations just get the number of elements in the Set, the cardinal number of the Set if you will. <br></p><p><strong>Why is this elegant? </strong></p><p>Because a Set cannot have duplicates. It does not matter how many times I add an item to a Set, a unique conversation ID can be added to it only once and similarly once a remove operation is performed, subsequent remove operations on the same conversation ID won’t have an affect on the data. The data has become idempotent.<br></p><p>This means that I don’t need an if-else condition when a conversation update operation is performed.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Amazon provides the ability to create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html">Billing Alarms</a> that can be used to alert whenever your AWS bill exceeds a certain threshold. However, this approach has a few shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to set a predefined threshold. When you are first starting to use AWS, it’s hard to know what your AWS bill will look like. A lot of people set this threshold pretty low to be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alert like this tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The alarm gets triggered once the threshold has already crossed. For example, I had forgotten to turn off an EC2 instance I was no longer using but I only found out about a week later once my billing threshold crossed the limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">Cost Explorer</a> does provide an easy-to-use interface that can help keep you on top of your billing data. However, this requires one to use the tool regularly to ensure we don’t miss anything.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at how to build a simple pipeline to send us billing reports over email. The generated report will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-cost-alerts/billing-email.png" alt="billing-alert-email" title="Billing Alert Email"></p>
<p>The tools we will use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Simple Email Service</li>
<li>Cost Explorer API</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-scaffolding">Create scaffolding</h4>
<p>We will create a new folder called <code>app</code> which will store the application logic for the Cost Explorer API as well as using SES.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>app
<span>touch </span>app/__init__.py app/cost_explorer.py app/email.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We will also create a file called <code>handler.py</code> in the root directory. This file will contain the logic used to generate billing reports.</p>

<h2 id="cost-explorer-api">Cost Explorer API</h2>
<p>We will be using the <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ce.html#CostExplorer.Client.get_cost_and_usage">Cost And Usage</a> endpoint from Cost Explorer to get the billing data we need.</p>

<p>Next, run the script from your terminal using the following command:</p>

<p>If your AWS profile is setup with the appropriate permissions, you should receive an email with your billing data. This what the email should look like:</p>

<h2 id="integrating-aws-lambda">Integrating AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>Now that we have generated the billing report locally, we will make use of the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless Framework</a> to create a serverless pipeline using AWS Lambda.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Setup serverless framework by following the instructions listed <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following commands after installing the serverless framework.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>npm init <span>-f</span>
npm <span>install</span> <span>--save-dev</span> serverless-python-requirements
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>serverless-python-requirements</code> plugin automatically bundles dependencies from <code>requirements.txt</code> and makes them available to your Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-serverless-project">Setting up the serverless project</h3>
<p>Next, create the file <code>serverless.yml</code> in your root directory and copy the following content:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>

<h4 id="key-points-2">Key points</h4>
<ul>
<li>The lambda function will have the permission to query the <code>CostAndUsage</code> function in Cost Explorer and <code>SendEmail</code> in SES.</li>
<li>To test our Lambda function, we will create a temporary HTTP endpoint called <code>hello</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lambda-handler">Lambda Handler</h3>
<p>Before we deploy the Lambda function to AWS, we need to update the Lambda function so that it can respond to an HTTP request. Update the contents of your <code>handler.py</code> with the following code snippet:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>app.cost_explorer</span> <span>import</span> <span>CostExplorer</span>
<span>from</span> <span>app.email</span> <span>import</span> <span>EmailClient</span>
