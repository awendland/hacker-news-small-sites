<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P1</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>port</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>isn’t going to fly because now the tuples have different types — <code>(P0, usize)</code> and <code>(P1, usize)</code> — and so they can’t hang together in the same collection.</p>

<p>Here’s the solution I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>PinIdx</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> <span>Port</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>COL_PINS</span>: <span>[(</span><span>Port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PinIdx</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>[(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>13</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>15</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>29</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>17</span><span>)];</span><span></span>

<p>Yup, good ol’ copy-paste to the rescue.</p>

<p>But wait, I hear you asking, what about <em>macros</em>?
Oh yes, my friend, I shaved the macro yak in the actual scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; …</pre></div></div></div>

    It seems to be widely accepted that creating a powerful, useful Emacs setup "by hand" is just too much trouble, and you should choose a "distro" like Doom Emacs. But is it really all so bad? If you go the route of "hand-made", will you suffer through endless nights of fixing your setup? The answer is: probably not, but read on for more details! <a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="why-custom-">
    <a href="#why-custom-">→ </a>Why Custom?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of respect for the various Emacs "distros" out there, but my inclination for DIY as well as for understanding my tools keeps me from going that route. I'd rather spend some time reading and researching than running a prefab setup that's effectively a mystery to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end of the day I do spend time on my configuration, but it's hardly the part-time job folks make it out to be. And throughout the years, I've learned a substantial amount about how Emacs actually works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prefab setups are usually nice until you hit some usability wall, or find a leak in the abstraction. Sometimes, you end up putting as much effort into learning your abstraction as you would have put into just learning the thing you tried to abstract. This is why I'm fine with getting my hands dirty with Emacs.

   <p>
    Before getting into the details of customizing Emacs, it's good to lay out some goals. This will help keep the project focused and prevent you from bloating your setup with things you don't really need. For me, the list looks something like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Automated, idempotent setup that can be repeated easily
    </li>
    <li>
     Declaratively install packages
    </li>
    <li>
     LSP support for languages that have a supporting server, powerful autocompletion for those that don't
    </li>
    <li>
     Quality-of-life packages and modes
    </li>
    <li>
     A wealth of custom keybindings to make life better
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I personally don't need a full-on project management system, or deep IDE-like integration, but indeed all of that is available if you'd want it. Anyways, with these goals in mind, let's begin to discuss implementation.
   </p>
   <h4 id="automatic--idempotent-setup">
    <a href="#automatic--idempotent-setup">→ </a>Automatic, Idempotent Setup
   </h4>
   <p>
    I want to be able to erase my entire setup, clone it down from a git repo, run Emacs, and be back to where I was before I nuked it all (assuming I've got no local, uncommitted changes). Additionally: I want to have a lockfile-like setup for freezing package versions.
   </p>
   <h5 id="straight-el">
    <a href="#straight-el">→ </a>straight.el
   </h5>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">straight.el</a> package manager is extremely powerful and allows for extreme reproducibility. It does so via:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Installing packages via git clone versus a tarball or some other archive <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="footnote-ref-2">2</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Easy integration of customized packages into your own setup, if desired <a href="#footnote-3"><sup id="footnote-ref-3">3</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A lockfile for controlling versions of each package <a href="#footnote-4"><sup id="footnote-ref-4">4</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Integration with <code>use-package</code> (more on that <a href="">later</a>) <a href="#footnote-5"><sup id="footnote-ref-5">5</sup></a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The straight.el bootstrap process allows for a totally self-installing setup. For example, with my configuration you just clone my repo to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and run Emacs; straight.el bootstraps itself and handles installing everything that I need.
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out the exquisite straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for details about how to get setup. It can do far more than what I've described here, so prepare for a deep dive. <a href="#footnote-6"><sup id="footnote-ref-6">6</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h4 id="declarative-package-installation">
    <a href="#declarative-package-installation">→ </a>Declarative Package Installation
   </h4>
   <p>
    As described above and in the project README, straight.el brings a nice element of reproducibility and control over packages and versions, but to take it even further I handle all package installations and their related config with <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/">use-package</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Integrating use-package with straight.el does require some configuration; again: see the straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for specifics. I strongly advise giving the project README a good look, it is high-quality documentation. <a href="#footnote-7"><sup id="footnote-ref-7">7</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--installing">
    <a href="#use-package--installing">→ </a>use-package: Installing
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package is extremely powerful and also very simple to use. The straight.el integration is done well too; consider this example for setting up OCaml support:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> tuareg <span>:</span>defer t <span>:</span>straight t<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The use-package syntax is simple and explicit, but what's happening here?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm installing the <code>tuareg-mode</code> package <a href="#footnote-8"><sup id="footnote-ref-8">8</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling use-package to not load this package until it's needed
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling straight.el to handle the installation
    </li>
    <li>
     By default, straight.el will try to find the package on Github
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Of course that's a very simple example; the use-package readme describes all the various features you can use to tune your setup.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--configuring">
    <a href="#use-package--configuring">→ </a>use-package: Configuring
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package allows configuring packages before and after they are loaded via the <code>:init</code> and <code>:config</code> keyword arguments, respectively.
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> flycheck-status-emoji
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>config
  <span>(</span><span>flycheck-status-emoji-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>

<pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> marginalia
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>init
  <span>(</span><span>marginalia-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <h5 id="use-package--key-binds">
    <a href="#use-package--key-binds">→ </a>use-package: Key Binds
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package also allows for configuring key binds on package load:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> windmove
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>bind
  <span>(</span><span>"M-e"</span> . windmove-left<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-u"</span> . windmove-right<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-k"</span> . windmove-up<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-j"</span> . windmove-down<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    All keybinds then live in your configuration, nicely inside the package declarations themselves.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--hooks">
    <a href="#use-package--hooks">→ </a>use-package: Hooks
   </h5>
   <p>
    The last feature I'm going to discuss is use-package's syntax for hooks:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> html-mode
  <span>:</span>no-require t
  <span>:</span>hook <span>(</span><span>web-mode</span> . skewer-html-mode<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    This should be starting to feel familiar, and again it's nice to have hooks defined with the related packages in an idiomatic way.
   </p>
   <h4 id="language-server">
    <a href="#language-server">→ </a>Language Server
   </h4>
   <p>
    But enough about the awesomeness of straight.el and use-package! One of the main things I wanted when I moved to Emacs was a powerful system for auto-completing code. Emacs has several ways to achieve this, but what I've come to use for almost every mode is <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/">lsp-mode</a> for integrating <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> capabilities into Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm using lsp-mode with almost all of the languages I work with regularly, except Lua. At least for now and for me, the current LSP experience with Lua wasn't as good as using company-mode. I'll definitely revisit that in the future though.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's isnt much else to say that isn't better said on the project documentation: but you can also refer to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hristoast/dot-emacs/tree/2bb9a7dd5ca8cb281c4f8a9a8bea0508464b5c63/item/lib/h-lsp.el">my configuration</a> for usage examples if desired.
   </p>
   <h4 id="quality-of-life">
    <a href="#quality-of-life">→ </a>Quality Of Life
   </h4>
   <p>
    Aside from that, there are a number of other things I've tuned to make my Emacs experience more to my liking:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the editing area <a href="#footnote-9"><sup id="footnote-ref-9">9</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the mode line <a href="#footnote-10"><sup id="footnote-ref-10">10</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dashboard or "startup page" <a href="#footnote-11"><sup id="footnote-ref-11">11</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Emoji icons for Flycheck status <a href="#footnote-12"><sup id="footnote-ref-12">12</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A handful of helper functions
    </li>
    <li>
     ws-butler, to clean up whitespace in edited files <a href="#footnote-13"><sup id="footnote-ref-13">13</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "TODO" keyword highlighting <a href="#footnote-14"><sup id="footnote-ref-14">14</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Rainbow parenthesis <a href="#footnote-15"><sup id="footnote-ref-15">15</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yasnippet for inserting various snippets <a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-ref-16">16</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     And many many more
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Software that's as endlessly customizeable as Emacs allows for all kinds of personal tweaks and touches. Over the year's I've built up my own collection of these and it continues to grow as I learn new things about Emacs.
   </p>
   <h4 id="custom-keybindings">
    <a href="#custom-keybindings">→ </a>Custom Keybindings
   </h4>
   <p>
    Last but not least: most folks will end up wanting to change a key binding at some point. Some go as far as to change the entire paradigm of the keybinds to do something like offer Vim bindings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I keep most of the default Emacs bindings but have changed more than a handful to suit my own needs. Some of these are defined with their related packages, others are just general additions or changes to some default Emacs binding. <a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-ref-17">17</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you've never done so, I highly encourage taking a look at <code>M-x describe-bindings RET</code>. It's a high-level view of all bindings in your setup.
   </p>
   <h3 id="conclusion">
    <a href="#conclusion">→ </a>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>
    This was definitely not written for the unitiated, but I hope it was somewhat useful as a reference to "modding" Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I'd like to highlight the power and usefulness of managing the editor configuration with Lisp code rather than clicking endlessly through some user interface (the general experience of most other editors).
   </p>
   <p>
    Having Lisp specifically and having it so tightly integrated with Emacs is where the majority of this power comes from. Learning to use it and work with it has been and continues to be a really great experience for me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>You are probably going to be dealing with text files sometime during your development career. These could be plain text, csv, or json. They may have data you want to get out, or log files you want to examine. You may be transforming from one format to another.</p>
<p>Now, if this is a regular occurrence, you may want to build a script or a program around this problem (or use a third party service which aggregates everything together). But sometimes these files are one offs. Or you use them once in a blue moon. And it can take a little while to write a script, look at the libraries, and put it all together.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to learn some of the unix tools available on <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/04/learn-the-command-line/">the command line</a>. Here are three that I consider “table stakes”.</p>
<p><strong>awk</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi purpose line processing utility. I often want to grab lines of a log file and figure out what is going on. Here’s a few lines of a log file:</p>
<p><code>54.147.20.92 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-" "Slackbot 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"</code></p>
<p>If I want to see only the ip addresses (assuming these are all in a file called logs.txt), I’d run something like:</p>
<p><code>$ awk '{print $1}' logs.txt<br>
54.147.20.92<br>
185.24.234.106<br>
185.24.234.106</code></p>
<p>There’s lots more, but you can see that you’d be able to slice and dice delimited data pretty easily. Here’s a <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-awk1/">great article which dives in further</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sed</strong></p>
<p>This is another line utility. You can use it for all kinds of things, but I primarily use it to do search and replace on a file. Suppose you had the same log file, but you wanted to anonymize the the ip address and the user agent. Perhaps you’re going to ship them off for long term storage or something. You can easily remove this with a couple of sed commands.</p>
<p><code>$ sed 's/^[^ ]*//' logs.txt |sed 's/"[^"]*"$//'<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com"</code></p>
<p>Yes, it looks like line noise, but this is the power of regular expressions. They’re in every language (though with slight variations) and worth learning. sed gives you the power of regular expressions at the command line for processing files. I don’t have a great sed tutorial I’ve found, but googling shows a number.</p>
<p><strong>jq</strong></p>
<p>If you work on the command line with modern software at all, you have encountered json. It’s used for configuration files and data transmission. Sometimes you get an array of json and you just want to pick out certain attributes of it. Tools like sed and awk fail at this, because they are used to newlines separating records, not curly braces and commas. Sure, you could use regular expressions to parse simple json, and there are times when I’ve done this. But a far better tool is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. I’m not as savvy with this as with the others, but have used it whenever I’m dealing with an API that delivers json (which is most modern ones). I can pull the API down with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> (another great tool) and parse it out with jq. I can put these all in a script and have the exploration be repeatable.</p>
<p>I did this a few months&nbsp; ago when I was doing some exploration of an elastic search system. I crafted the queries with curl and then used jq to parse out the results so that I could make some sense of this. Yes, I could have done this with a real programming language, but it would have taken longer. I could also have used a gui tool like postman, but then it would not have been replicable.</p>
<p>sed and awk should be on every system you run across; jq is non standard, but easy to install. It’s worth spending some time getting to know these tools. So next time you are processing a text file and need to extract just a bit of it, reach for sed and awk. Next time you get a hairy json file and you are peering at it, look at jq. I think you’ll be happy with the result.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Currently, the collision of artists and cryptocurrencies is playing out across Twitter and other platforms, dividing artists who normally praise and support each other into two camps. One camp wants to make money selling their art as NFTs, and the other camp hates the idea.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun to see cryptoart/NFTs bring a class war to the digital art community. I love see artists that have followed each other for years block each other. This is exactly the thing this community needed</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1367982561079697408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>If you haven’t heard already, NFTs are enjoying increasing popularity alongside the current record-high cryptocurrency values. NFT stands for <strong>Non-Fungible Token</strong> – an atomic digital token that can be traded for cryptocurrency. Many artists are now selling “digital editions” of their artwork as NFTs on special-purpose marketplaces – the buyer can call themselves the owner of a piece of digital art, similar to how one might purchase a limited edition print. Some of these art NFTs have been trading for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, despite granting the buyer no physical copy, no reproduction rights, or anything other than the ability to say, “Yes, I own this token,” and to sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>What’s been particularly divisive is the objection to the shockingly high energy usage of the most popular cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">One estimate</a> puts the energy consumption involved in a single NFT sale at around 340 kWh, equivalent to driving 1,000km in an ICE car. Most of this is due to the proof-of-work algorithm that’s core to Ethereum[1], the blockchain that most of these NFT sales take place on. Essentially, many objectors see making and selling NFTs as something akin to clearcutting rainforests in order to grow crops.</p>
<p>The artists putting their work up as NFTs see this as an opportunity to live the artist’s dream – to produce highly sought-after pieces for which collectors will pay large sums of money. It’s simultaneously an elevation of their value and status, and also their ticket to a life free from the struggle of paying the bills. Is it so easy to pass on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance at wealth, even when people are telling you that it’s contributing to environmental harm?</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to make tens of thousands of dollars off one piece of art. I want to be wealthy and comfortable off of my artwork.

</div></figure>
<p>The YES NFT camp has a few arguments, including that NFT transactions are not 1:1 correlated with increased energy use[2], and aren’t you eating meat anyways?</p>
<p>The NO NFT camp seems to have been already stressed out by anti-maskers, racial injustice, income inequality, and all the other ills of the world, only to find out that their beloved colleagues are willing to sell out the environment for a chance to make a quick buck. Depending on who you ask, the whole thing smacks of tech-bro[3] greed, a pyramid scheme, or abandoning your morals.</p>
<p>This has caused some heated threads on Twitter around these talking points, and since it doesn’t seem totally fair to air all the drama – Twitter is very public though! – I’ll put my predictions here instead:</p>
<div><div>
<p>The NFT gold rush won’t last forever. Yes, some artists and speculators have made a good chunk of change selling NFTs. But the idea of artists simultaneously having trouble getting $1,000 commission work while selling old JPEGs for tens of thousands of dollars doesn’t add up. The money that’s buying NFTs is either speculators hoping to resell it for more, or people who previously accumulated cryptocurrency and are either reluctant to cash out or are under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>. They wouldn’t spend $1,000 on a digital picture, but would happily spend 0.7 ETH ($1,137).</p>
<p>As more NFTs are minted and put up for sale (supply increases) and the cryptocurrency wealth sloshing around settles or hype dies down (demand decreases), I think NFT prices and volume will settle down to lower levels. No artist to my knowledge has become wealthy by selling NFTs yet, but in the future the chances of even paying your bills via NFTs will be very low.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Despite my negative outlook on NFTs, I think they’ll be around in the long run with limited use[4] along the lines of Patreon – if people are willing to pay monthly to support an artist, why not also be the Digital Owner of one of that artist’s works? It’s a way to publicly show your support for your favorite artists.</p>
<p>[1] Ethereum is not scheduled to move to proof-of-stake until some time in 2022. The NFT gold rush may run out of steam by then.</p>
<p>[2] The USD price of a cryptocurrency has a bigger correlation to its mining electricity consumption. The higher the price, the more profitable it is to keep your computer on all night mining cryptocurrency, thus the best way to fight the environmental cost is to crash the USD exchange rate. There’s even a plausible scenario where artists selling their earned ETH to pay their bills puts downward pressure on the USD-ETH rate, reducing ETH’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>[3] The artists selling NFTs seem to be mostly men, like cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are also mostly men. This is based on my limited non-scientific browsing of NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>[4] One legitimately interesting use case for NFTs could center around tracking ownership of Original Characters (OCs), for which there already is a thriving market for trading and selling. Basically, the artist draws a cool/fierce/cute/sexy paladin/drow/khajiit/whatever character, and the buyer gets exclusive rights to own that character, use it for role playing, take the included “refsheet” to other artists to commission custom art of said character, or resell the character. It’s all very ad-hoc and exists largely outside the world of copyright law as we know it. The demographic also seems to be teenagers, which might hamper adoption of NFTs.</p>

<p><span>This page will be an ever-evolving log of my backyard shedquarters. The last update was February 28th.</span></p>
<p>During 2020 I began working full-time from home in our 2 bedroom house. I completely took over the kitchen table
for a while because I thought the pandemic would only last a few weeks, which was adorable in hindsight. After a
couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

        1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/render.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/render.jpg"></a></p>
<p><span><em>You can click on any picture to view it full size.</em></span></p>
<p>You can view the actual model here:

<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>

<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>

<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>

<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg"></a></p>
<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots of shims and that seemed to make it
fit well enough. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<p>Before we did this part I watched a lot of videos on YouTube, and my neighbor (who is <a href="https://www.micekmade.com/">a …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

    <div>
      <p>I recently proposed a new research project idea: let’s take all of GitHub (or &lt;insert your preferred VCS host&gt;) and create a multi-language (even partially language-agnostic) concrete syntax tree of all the code so that we can do some otherwise impossibly difficult further research and answer incredibly complex questions.</p>

<p>This project is named <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">World Syntax Tree</a>, or WST in short.</p>

<p>Originally I started the project using MongoDB and storing references between nodes as <code>ObjectID</code>s, but I quickly realized that a tabular format was not performant enough to be able to effectively represent a true tree.</p>

<p>So instead I switched over the whole project to the first and foremost graph database I came across: Neo4j.</p>

<p>As I quickly learned the new database paradigm I also quickly learned that there are a lot of problems between me and inserting literally hundreds of terabytes of data into a single graph…</p>



<p>The very first designs used <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel">neomodel</a> to control the layout and define the graph connections, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py">we still use neomodel</a> for the less performance-sensitive parts of the collection process.</p>

<p>After running with neomodel for a fairly long time it was obvious it was far too much overhead when I inspected the collector process with <code>cProfile</code> and <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/">snakeviz</a>.</p>

<p>Using neomodel there were more than twice as many required queries for simply inserting one syntax node (<code>WSTNode</code>), extra checks like Cardinality and multiple statements just to set properties on newly created nodes were quite slow: at best I found I could insert a few hundred nodes per second using 128 processes.</p>



<p>From just the first few google results it was clear that writing my own raw cypher queries was the next move in order to better control exactly what operations needed to happen.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Profiler view: Majority of runtime stuck inside neomodel's checks</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The next PR that came from these efforts reworked the WSTNode creation routine into a series of functions that each did a distinct task: <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/c8d3f9f2c04f231dd93b4504b72a3f4da097edcf/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L91">create the node, connect the node, add the node text, connect the node text,</a> etc.</p>

<p>This did improve compared to using neomodel, but now the major bottleneck was really waiting on the network socket.</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/n2.png" alt="Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each of those 5 blocks corresponds to one of the 5 functions used during insertion of a WSTNode, noticing how they were all approximately the same size led me onto my next improvement…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once I saw how long each query took to initialize a connection and read back the results I figured I should reduce the total number of queries, which was quite easy really.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a node, returning the ID, running a new query to connect using that ID… just rewriting the create query to connect the new node as well meant an entire query less to execute!</p>

<p>So now that we <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/ea9dcc968e83534318a049268ca5c674b7ae6d1c/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L107">reduced the number of calls made per node by more than half</a> we saw a reasonable improvement, but we’re still only talking about a few hundred nodes per second even with more than a 100 workers.</p>



<p>Now we’re at the difficult part of the problem. Because we’re inserting a collection of nodes that refer to each other, we can’t iterate them all in parallel, otherwise some nodes might not have their parent node written to the database yet.</p>

<p>So in order to do this I needed to add another property to the WSTNode structure: <code>preorder</code>. This property was unique for nodes within a file and is calculated before we insert the WSTNode into the database, meaning we can use this property to refer to nodes before they are given a node ID by neo4j.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to refer to nodes uniquely within the file we can batch together large numbers of node insertions by using the super-magical <code>UNWIND</code> cypher statement. Essentially this allows us to pass a huge query parameter (like 10,000 node’s worth of properties in a list) and <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L71-L86">execute a single query to create those 10,000 nodes</a>.</p>



<p>If any experienced Neo4j user has followed along so far, they might have already realized that the <code>preorder</code> property on my WSTNodes is not unique within the graph, so even though <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py#L65">we do have an index on that property</a>, when your graph grows to terabytes in size, you will have far too many nodes with the same <code>preorder</code> to efficiently search them all to find the one that has a relationship to the same <code>WSTFile</code> node we’re working in.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L75">this single extra condition inside the WHERE clause</a> the Neo4j database regularly would pin all 128 hardware threads of our lab server just searching through <code>WSTNode</code>s with the same <code>preorder</code> just to find the one that has a relationship to our <code>WSTFile</code>.</p>

<p>So instead I needed a way to refer to the nodes I just created with a constant-time lookup. I spent a whole day just thinking about how to overcome this problem, and finally ended up just accepting the fact that it would be faster to just execute two queries rather than continue banging my head against cypher syntax quirks.</p>

<p>After the first query I use the returned created node IDs to do the constant-time relationship creation in the second query. There might be some way to create relationships based on results from an <code>UNWIND</code>, but as long as we’ve got constant-time inserts on the db side I am happy.</p>

<p>And it was indeed faster:</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/nn3.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/nn3.png" alt="Snakeviz of single-file run"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Snakeviz of single-file run</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How’s that for performance improvement? We went from 330 seconds to under 3! Of course, 330 seconds for a single file was kind of absurd in the first place.</p>

<p>Now that my program was blazing fast, Neo4j has trouble keeping up:</p>



<p>These are problems I encountered outside the scope of my own program.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-transactions-in-memory">Too many transactions in memory</h2>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png" alt="Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My initial guess for large batch sizes was around 10,000 nodes per query, however when we multiply that by 128 (processes running in parallel) and a conservative estimate for RAM usage, we’re looking at trying to processes transactions in memory at multiple gigabytes per second.</p>

<p>The solution to this was to manually set the memory settings in <code>neo4j.conf</code>, since I have a fairly large system dedicated to research work I could steal quite a bit of memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Settings from memrec had to be changed a bit vs what was recommended:
# I need at least 128G left over for my own code to run on the same system
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>initial_size</span>=<span>31</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>max_size</span>=<span>128</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>pagecache</span>.<span>size</span>=<span>259500</span><span>m</span>

<span># It is also recommended turning out-of-memory errors into full crashes,
# instead of allowing a partially crashed database to continue running:
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>jvm</span>.<span>additional</span>=-<span>XX</span>:+<span>ExitOnOutOfMemoryError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="database-not-up-to-the-requested-version">Database not up to the requested version</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>neo4j.exceptions.TransientError: {code: Neo.TransientError.Transaction.BookmarkTimeout} {message: Database 'top1k' not up to the requested version: 113071. Latest database version is 113054}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a tricky one, I still haven’t fully pinned down the exact conditions for this to happen, but it boils down to the database not applying the transactions in a timely manner, meaning the current “live version” could be more than a few transactions out of date. (With my scale of data it ranged from 5-20 versions out of date.)</p>

<p>The best solution I could come up for this problem was to only run half as many worker processes, my guess is that the database was having trouble handling 128 consecutive transactions at a time.</p>

<p>I’d like to know why exactly this happens, and if possible I would much rather prefer the query to stall until the requested version is met (or error the original query if that version can’t be reached) rather than fail a query later on.</p>

<p>If you happen to know something about why or how this happens, please leave a comment, email me, or even <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">open an issue on our project</a>!</p>

<h3 id="a-persistent-problem">A persistent problem</h3>

<p>I thought if I reduced the load on the database significantly it would have no problem keeping up, so I brought the batch size down to just 100 and ran only 8 processes, and yet we still arrive at the same problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database ‘top1k’ not up to the requested version: 2282021. Latest database version is 2282020</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is my database stuck in 2020 you ask? Not a clue, so this is really where the adventure begins.</p>

<p>Over the few days since initial release of this post, I have been trying nothing but to get to the bottom of why this is occuring, I have carefully picked through both the neo4j <code>debug.log</code> and <code>query.log</code> and nothing really stood out as a problem.</p>

<p>One thing notable about these errors is they always seem to happen after passing around ~250GB of data stored. The most I could store before being stopped by this error was ~319GB (uncompressed) in the neo4j data directory. There are only ~500 million nodes and ~1.7 billion relationships at this point, meaning the average inserted node was well under a kilobyte, all within reason.</p>

<p>I can definitively confirm that there’s no problem with the hardware, the data directory is stored on a RAIDZ (zfs) array of all SSD storage, and I’ve confirmed that I/O time is not the bottleneck, and there are over 50 unused CPU cores to spare.</p>

<p>So my thoughts now are that the insert time for these nodes might not actually be constant as I thought, otherwise we’d see the same behavior between millions of nodes and just a few thousand. Perhaps there’s nonlinear work being done in some of the indexes? Maybe the data is too large to be indexed fully? There are a number of reasons to test, so finding the real cause will take quite a bit of time.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.</p>

<hr>

<p>Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence on art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility. Rather than only having things designed by engineers.</p>

<p>At the time, few artists were willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture and in general in creating things for the common people. Mass-manufacturing technology could allow that at scale. So some years after the creation of the school, he adjusted the focus in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘Art and technology: a new unity’.</p>

<hr>

<p>But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students’ practical lessons were given by craftsmen whose experience was in making things by hand and not in designing for production.</p>

<p>For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would handmade prototypes with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. For instance using spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were hard to make in a mass-production facility.</p>

<p>But the strongest critique of the Bauhaus lack of technological knowledge was Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was familiar with the work of the Bauhaus due to the Black Mountain College in the US, where he and other former Bauhaus tutors were teaching. According to him, the ‘International Style’ brought to the US by the Bauhaus, simple replaced the previous decorative style with a new simplified one made of basic shapes and colours. A new exterior, but that was leaving unchanged the structural and functional elements of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short they only looked at problems of modifications of the surface of end-product, which end-products were inherently sub-functions of a technically obsolete world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Obviously, Bucky did all the things he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about. But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).</p>

<hr>

<p>The excitement of the Bauhauslers for new technologies is still present among designers now. And so is that limit in understanding fully a new innovation that can be used in a new product or service. I feel that every time I’m working with machine learning. But what the Bauhaus achieved was to get artists interested in bringing their sensibility in the creative use of technology. And whatever Bucky thinks, that remains.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.
</p>



<p>
  <small>
  †
  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).
  </small>
</p>


<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq"></a></h2>
<ol>
  <li id="faq-who">
    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-why">
    <h3>
      Why are you doing this?
      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-book">
    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.
    </p>

<cap>This video might take a few seconds to load. Please squint for best results :).</cap>

<p>The results of this experiment are not exactly close to my target as you can see, but I thought it was worth a blog post anyway. There was this rough idea I’ve been thinking about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> for a really long time.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>— yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>I came across <a href="https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html">an article</a> of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow “program” a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving this. One is by placing still life states at specific pixels as described in this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/38573/paint-a-still-life-or-a-moving-one-draw-an-image-in-the-game-of-life">codegolf question</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking of is to display Mona Lisa for a single frame/generation of ‘non-still’ Game of Life.</p>



<p>I began working on a proof of concept using the hill climbing algorithm. The idea was very simple. Iteratively modify a random 2D Game of Life state until it’s Nth generation looks similar to Mona Lisa. Here’s the full algorithm.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    best_score := infinity
    target := mona lisa with dimensions m x n
    canvas := random matrix of m x n
    best_result := canvas
    do
        modified_canvas := Copy of canvas with a single random cell inverted
        nth_modified_canvas := Run N generations of Game of Life modified_canvas
        Compute a score of how close nth_modified_canvas is with target
        if score &lt; best_score then
        	best_score := score
            best_result := modified_canvas
        canvas := best_result
    while(max_iterations limit passed or best_score &lt; threshold)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hacked up a single core prototype.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>def modify(canvas, shape):
    x,y = shape
    px = int(np.random.uniform(x+1))-1
    py = int(np.random.uniform(y+1))-1
    canvas[px][py] = not canvas[px][py]
    return canvas

def rmse(predictions,targets):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions-targets)**2))

while best_score&gt;limit:
    canvases = np.tile(np.copy(best_seed), (batch_size, 1, 1))
    rms_errors = []
    for canvas in range(len(canvases)):
        canvases[canvas] = modify(states[state], (m,n))
        rmse_val = rmse(target, nth_generation(np.copy(canvases[canvas])))
        rms_errors.append(rmse_val)
    lowest = min(rms_errors)
    if lowest &lt; best_score:
        best_score = lowest
        best_result = canvases[rms_errors.index(lowest)]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hill Climbing works by finding the closest neighboring state to a current state with the least error from a ‘target_state’ (Mona Lisa). The way I find the closest neighbor in every step is to create a copy of the best solution we have so far and invert a random cell. This change is small enough that we don’t risk stepping over any local minima. Also we use root mean square error metric to compare the best state and the target. Other error metrics can be experimented with, but for this problem, I found that RMSE was sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few days of CPU time(!), I was able to obtain something that resembled Mona Lisa after running 4 generations of life.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/lisa_cpu.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>It was reassuring that my algorithm did indeed work, but I realize I made a bunch of mistakes and of course it’s not really scalable for larger images or fast.</p>



<p>Target Mona Lisa against which our random state was compared with was the medium resolution version taken from Wikipedia and converted to monochrome using PIL’s <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('L')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-38-08-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<cap><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg">Taken from wikipedia</a></cap>

<p>When you’re comparing against boolean variables, It’s better that we the target as a binary matrix rather than the whole grayscale range.</p>

<p>In this attempt, I simply rounded these grayscale values to 0s and 1s. This was a mistake as it washed away a lot of details.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-39-11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We could just not round at all and compare against the grayscale version, but there is a better way.</p>



<p>Not every random matrix of 0s and 1s are a valid Game of Life state. States that can never be an nth generation (n&gt;0) of any Cellular Automata are called Garden of Edens. It is almost impossible that our monochrome-rounded Mona Lisa is a valid Game of Life generation. We can only hope to have a solution that’s approximately close to the target.</p>

<p>This is a portion of the 4th generation of the state we just prepared.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-08-47.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Judging by the texture, the way life patterns evolve and from just experimenting with images, I found that comparing against a 1-bit dithered version the target should improve the quality of results.</p>

<p>Dithered image has a somewhat even distribution of 0 and 1 cells which is somewhat close to what a randomly initialized Game of Life state will look like after a few generations. This property is also maintained when you scale up the image, (which we’ll optimize for soon).</p>

<p>We could do this using PIL (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>) using <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('1')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-54-34.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also you can see from the last result, it’s impossible to get a continuous array of white cells because they will be killed off by the overpopulation rule. Completely dark areas are stable in life. The end result will be a higher contrast, but slightly darkened version of Mona Lisa. At higher resolutions, this effect is not as apparent.</p>



<p>The single core unvectorized version is extremely slow. I tried running this in both my 8th gen Core i7 and the Google Colab CPU machines, but you need to wait for hours/days (depending on target resolution) to get something that resembles the original.</p>

<p>Fortunately, This problem is well suited for parallelization.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jax/master/images/jax_logo_250px.png" alt=""></p>

<p>JAX is a python library that lets you use a version of numpy and compile it to highly vectorized code that can be run on a GPU/TPU. We need to rework this algorithm for a GPU.</p>

<p>GPUs generally suited to high-throughput type computations that has good data-parallelism. We need to exploit the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture to gain faster execution speeds.</p>

<p>We extrude the <code>target</code>(Mona Lisa) and <code>canvas</code>(initial random state) to 3rd dimension with 3rd dimension being <code>batch_size</code> long tensor loafs (Consider a loaf of bread, with each slice being dithered Mona Lisa).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-another-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-copy.png" alt=""></p>
<cap>Initial canvas will be completely random(unlike the figure).</cap>

<p>We set <code>best_canvas</code> to the initial random canvas before our hill climbing loop.</p>

<p>Also, for every loop iteration, we need to produce a random tensor called mutator(same shape as <code>target</code>) with this property: Each slice should have all zeros except a single one place at a random location.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-3rd-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>array([[[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 1],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<cap><br>Example mutator with shape 5, 3, 2. batch_size being 5</cap>

<p>The idea is that in every loop, we use the mutator to calculate the nearest set of neighboring states from our best_canvas like this <code>canvas = (best_canvas + mutator)%2</code>.</p>

<p>We compute N generations of game of life across every slice of this modified canvas. Then, we do a 3D RMSE(mean being calculated for the slice only) on the Nth generation canvas against Mona Lisa, and find the slice with the lowest error.
This is slice is then extruded and set to best_canvas and the loop repeats till a finite number of iterations pass.</p>

<p>The notebook for this project is <a href="https://github.com/avinayak/mona_lisa_gol_jax/blob/main/mona_lisa_overdrive.ipynb">available in github</a>. I’ll explain what every block is doing in this section. If you want to see results, skip to the end of the article.</p>

<p>The core of this project, the game of life function is actually taken from <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">this post</a>. Thank you  Bojan Nikolic :). I followed his convention of importing <code>jax.numpy</code> as <code>N</code>, <code>jax.lax</code> as <code>L</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline 
import jax
N=jax.numpy
L=jax.lax
from jax.experimental import loops
from jax import ops
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from google.colab import files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, <code>wget</code> Mona Lisa</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!wget -O target.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/483px-Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg?download
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not a crazy high res version.It’s only 483px wide.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>batch_size = 100
image_file = Image.open("target.png")
image_file = image_file.convert('1')
lisa = N.array(image_file, dtype=N.int32)
width,height = lisa.shape
lisa_loaf = onp.repeat(lisa[onp.newaxis, :, :,], batch_size, axis = 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This section dithers Mona Lisa using the and extrudes it to <code>batch_size</code> length.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
canvas_loaf = jax.random.randint(key, (batch_size, width, height), 0, 2, dtype= N.int32) #for tests, initialize random lisa

<p>Here, we’re seeding JAX PRNG(will be explained soon). Also we’re creating the initial random <code>canvas_loaf</code> with integers 0 and 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@jax.jit

<p>This quickstart guide is inspired by <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a>. It makes the assumption that you already have <a href="https://docs.toit.io/installation/toitcli/">Toit installed</a> on your machine.</p>
<p>Toit is an object-oriented programming language for the internet of things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, simple, and approachable</li>
<li>High-level and object-oriented</li>
<li>Declarative and statically analyzable</li>
<li>Safe and garbage collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started with some programming!</p>
<h2 id="hello_world">Hello, World<a href="#hello_world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A local installation of Toit comes with support for running small programs directly from the command line. If you put the following code in a file called <code>hello.toit</code></p>


<p>you can run it from the command line like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What just happened? The <code>toit</code> command line tool read your source code (<code>hello.toit</code>) and started running it from the <code>main</code> method that you defined. The <code>main</code> method consists of all the indented statements just below the method declaration line <code>main:</code>. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces you add to your programs are significant.</p>
<p>Once the program ran, it printed <code>Hello World!</code> in your terminal. This is because the only statement in <code>hello.toit</code> is a method call, where you invoke the <code>log</code> method with a single argument, which is the string to be logged (in this case, printed to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than one line from your program, you could update it to:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  log "Hello World!"
  log "Hello World!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="defining_a_method">Defining a method<a href="#defining_a_method" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another method:</p>


<p>and call that from <code>main</code>:</p>


<p>Calling a method in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the method doesn’t take arguments that’s all you need.</p>
<p>What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name:
  log "Hello $name!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, <code>hi</code> is a method that takes a single argument. We can use that from <code>main</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and it works!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="inserting_strings_in_strings">Inserting strings in strings<a href="#inserting_strings_in_strings" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What’s the <code>$name</code> bit? That’s Toit's way of inserting something into a string. It is called <em>string interpolation</em>. The bit after the <code>$</code> is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing whitespace is ignored:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name = "World":
  log "Hello, $name.trim!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, we call the <code>trim</code> method on the <code>name</code> string before we insert it into the outer string. If we call <code>hi "   Lars  "</code> we still get the familiar greeting <code>Hello Lars!</code> and not <code>Hello   Lars  !</code>. You can add parentheses around the <code>name.trim</code> expression in the string to make it clearer which parts belong to the outer string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  log "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the code above? We added a default value for the <code>name</code> parameter, so if the name isn’t supplied when you call <code>hi</code>, we use the default name "World". Now we can try:</p>


<p>and get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="evolving_into_a_greeter">Evolving into a greeter<a href="#evolving_into_a_greeter" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a <code>Greeter</code> class:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name = "World":

  say_hi: log "Hi $name.trim!"

  say_bye: log "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called <code>Greeter</code> and a bunch of methods for that class. Pay special attention to the method <code>constructor</code>. There is nothing after the <code>:</code> and the <code>constructor</code> method isn’t followed by any indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  constructor .name = "World":
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a constructor and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class <code>Greeter</code> takes a single argument (<code>name</code>), but the <code>.</code> prefix to the <code>.name</code> parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on <code>Greeter</code> objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the <code>:=</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The field parameter <code>.name</code> still has a default value, so if we don’t pass a name, the <code>Greeter</code> will greet the world.</p>
<p>The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> methods are introduced on the next two lines. The methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line each. The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> method both use the <code>name</code> field from the object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method simply by mentioning them (<code>name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="creating_a_greeter_object">Creating a greeter object<a href="#creating_a_greeter_object" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, <code>Greeter</code>. The greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings. If we run this, we get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the <code>name</code> method on it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This would show <code>How are you  Helena ?</code>. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the name isn’t trimmed like we expected. Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="fields_and_methods">Fields and methods<a href="#fields_and_methods" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (<code>_</code>) are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_:= null
  constructor .name_ = "World":
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This removes the <code>name</code> method from greeters, but if we really want to allow accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the same meaning as before.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_
  say_hi: log "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Here we use the new keyword <code>return</code> to specify the value a method returns. We could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:</p>


<p>In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we can avoid repeating the call to <code>trim</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say_hi: log "Hi $name!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We can check that it works by running:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and you should see <code>How are you Erik?</code>. Inside <code>main</code>, we store the greeter in a local variable (<code>greeter</code>) so we can keep referring to the same object. You can think of it as a way to give a specific object a name that is only valid and useful inside the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Just like introducing a member variable, we can use the <code>:=</code> syntax in methods and functions like <code>main</code> to introduce local variables.</p>
<h2 id="greetings_everyone">Greetings everyone!<a href="#greetings_everyone" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let’s try to build that. We will start with a class definition:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>So MegaGreeter objects have a list of <code>names</code>. The <code>names</code> field is initialized to the empty list (<code>[]</code>). The body of the <code>MegaGreeter</code> constructor adds the given <code>name</code> argument to the end of the list of names. Notice that this is different than using a <code>.name</code> parameter that automatically assigns to the field called <code>name</code>. Mega greeters don't have a single name and no <code>name</code> field, so here the <code>name</code> is just an ordinary parameter that we can use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  log "The names are $greeter.names"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>will lead to this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
The names are ["World"]
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name

  say_hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: log "Hello $it!"
  say_bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    log "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s dive into the new constructs in the next sections.</p>

<p>Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler. Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few single line comments:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Such comments start with <code>//</code> and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.</p>
<p>You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to your code. The general structure is that after a <code>:</code> you can have a single construct if it fits on one line:</p>


<p>or you can add a newline after the <code>:</code> and let the following lines that are indented relative to the outer construct …</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>
