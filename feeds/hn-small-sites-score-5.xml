The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_12181"><div><div><p>This question is interesting because it asks two questions that don't necessarily have to be related:</p><p>- is there an easy way to solve this<br>- is there a non-"brute force" way solve this</p><p>Before moving on I want to mention that this little snippet of R involves a lot more abstraction then it seems at first glance. What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>

<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>

<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

            <p>
	Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" — a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online.</p>
<p>
	Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about <a href="http://www.tlf.gov.cn/zjtluf/rkyy/rkgk.htm" target="_blank">633,400 people</a> just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>
	Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to U.S. press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120418_Busby_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities</a> have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>
	The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" target="_blank">"human rights violations and abuses"</a> in the region.</p>
<p>
	Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>
	"There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."</p>
<p>
	But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region.</p>
<p>
	"[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"> complicit with genocide," </a>said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.</p>
<h3>
	A FILM PLAGUED BY SETBACKS</h3>
<p>
	Disney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate — remarks that were reported in Chinese state media.</p>
<p>
	"We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.</p>
<p>
	Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/media/disney-mulan-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">"tailor-made for success."</a></p>
<p>
	But the film — which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about <a href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/history/1706/4656-1.htm" target="_blank">a female warrior</a> who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army — has already faced controversy and setbacks.</p>
<p>
	In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account.</p>
<p>
	"I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-mulan-actor-protests-intl-hnk-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">posted to her official Weibo account.</a> At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">defended their actions</a> in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")</p>
<p>
	Then in March, Disney was forced to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/mulan-delay-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">delay the film's release</a> as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.</p>
<p>
	Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a US$30 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/media/mulan-disney-china-international-release/index.html" target="_blank">video-on-demand </a>last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)</p>
<p>
	The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/entertainment/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Thailand and Taiwan</a> have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year.</p>
<p>
	And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.</p>
<p>
	After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1157286.shtml" target="_blank"> Japanese "ninja gestures"</a> and Chinese stereotypes.</p>
<h3>
	CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY</h3>
<p>
	Allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population.</p>
<p>
	Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">lengthy detentions,</a> abuse, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/asia/china-xinjiang-leaks-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">mass birth control</a> — which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."</p>
<p>
	In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang<strong> </strong>and said she was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZle-neFOc-/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">scouting out locations</a> for the film. And in an interview in September<strong> </strong>with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-location-mulan" target="_blank">Taklamakan Desert</a>, in the region's far southwest.</p>
<p>
	Adrian Zenz, a leading academic<strong> </strong>at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.</p>
<p>
	Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss.</p>
<p>
	"There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.</p>
<p>
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."</p>
<p>
	Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2013-07/05/content_16731473.htm" target="_blank">according to state media.</a></p>
<p>
	Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yaqiu/status/1303002585155149825" target="_blank">disclose what assistance</a> it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.</p>
<p>
	And<strong> </strong>Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market.</p>
<p>
	"Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said.</p>
<p>
	"You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

CUDA, OpenCL, DNNL, Java, and Clojure</a> teaches the nuts and bolts of neural networks and deep learning
by showing you how Deep Diamond is built, <b>from scratch</b>? In interactive sessions. Each line of code
can be executed and the results inspected in the plain Clojure REPL. The best way to master something is to build
it yourself!

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>

<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>

<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>

<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the
paper
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf"><span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System</a> (1974)
by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and
F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>
<p>– <span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&nbsp;(1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

				<p>Axial operates a confidential online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of privately held small and medium sized businesses. The platform is 100% software enabled and includes tools and recommendation engines to empower both buyers and sellers to discover, connect and transact with one another. By expanding the reach of both buyers and sellers and eliminating hundreds of hours of manual time spent pursuing an offline transaction process allows deals with the most merit to rise to the top. The platform goes beyond matching the correct individuals and focuses on facilitating success at many levels. A key example of this is the platform's ability to facilitate real human to human interactions with communication on the platform itself.</p><blockquote><em>“Axial at its core is a specialized matching engine and communication platform.”</em></blockquote><p>The ability for the platform to connect people on a deeper level is what has made it a successful medium for completed deals and a major contributor to democratizing capital markets. As Zach Werheim, Director of Engineering at Axial, puts it, “one big goal is to be able to help people where they need it — for those who, otherwise, would never be able to get it."</p><p>Zach is a prominent software engineer and tech leader who has led a number of engineering teams. He, along with the rest of the Axial team, were quick to recognize the rapidly evolving market conditions in the way people communicate. The mindset of their users was changing quickly, and it was critical to provide them with industry best practices and features.</p><p>The Axial platform has served their customers for over 10 years. In that time they’ve endeavored to maintain best practices while evolving with emerging technologies. Their philosophy of pushing innovation results in a couple of issues arising that the team must address.</p><p><em><strong>1. Ensuring institutional knowledge isn’t lost over time.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2. Making it easy to adopt the newest best technologies.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3. Making their tooling accessible to their developers.</strong></em></p><p>Applications being built and improved over the course of a decade are always at risk of institutional knowledge being lost. It is paramount that developer and operations workflows and processes are common knowledge and not siloed. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, there are a new set of tools and processes which represent best practices. A core facet of engineering at Axial is to adopt the latest best practices to empower their development team to perform at their highest.</p><blockquote><br><em>Zach was on a mission to make it easier for their development team to adopt optimal tooling without silos and individual points of failure. This would empower their dev team to make the best technology choices while ensuring that the tool knowledge was collaborative and distributed. The solution was creating their own workflows meshed with the optimal tools for their day-to-day operations.</em><br></blockquote><p>After evaluating multiple tools with limited success, the team came across <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform by CTO.ai</a>. The Ops Platform allowed them to start building solutions immediately by creating and automating developer workflows. These workflows were sharable with the entire team and could plug into any specific developer tooling that was necessary. They did this via Slack workflows and the CTO.ai SlackOps capability. Axial built 3 initial Ops to empower their engineering teams right away: The Dev Op, The Vault Op, and The Cluster Op.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-the-dev-op">1. The Dev Op</h3><p>The engineering team leverages VMs which run in AWS, which also run most of their services for development. Their Dev Command controls the state of their DevBox for AWS cost savings. When the development team isn’t active, it can easily be turned off or turn on, on demand. The team also implemented an automatic shut off. Because it’s built as an Op, the team can run these suites of commands directly from Slack and avoid having to interface with the AWS Console or other specific services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WJ21lVtgdBCuga-WYA2xJc8h3LQUojaozdTE7cuiVgfVYtDC80LbgJRN0D1_gMul3ekbXDjS3zMwLXszGVPEGzwMOWVcRYSO6nXbTRbYIfw90_7zeRCAnBtiEZhIjThFDvNPGC3A"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br>

The <em>Dev </em>Op specifically helped save on their AWS bill by making it easy for the team to activate development services only when necessary. Across the 5 DevBoxes, Zach is able to save over 12 hours of uptime per day, which equates to a savings of over $5,900 annually. The Ops Platform made it simple to build—not only to save money, but also to streamline development for the rest of the engineering team and save developer hours.</p><blockquote><em>“Without CTO.ai, we would have to adopt the bare minimum tooling. Anything new would have to be written in a language our team was familiar with and we’d be running scripts manually. Having this technology available is going to make it easier to develop dev operations around new systems. It’s definitely going to be a big advantage for us going forward”</em></blockquote><div><p>Zach plans to continue to build key Ops to empower the rest of his team. Specifically, a production release pipeline. In addition, there are a lot of fragmented utility scripts their team uses to run various operations. These scripts currently sit in a folder and eventually become outdated as infrastructure changes. “Opifying” these would allow them to be version controlled and give the entire team more visibility. Zach has also thought about ways to empower other departments of the organization with Ops. One of their next plans for Ops is to build an “extremely simple and impossible to screw up” SlackOp to empower their marketing department to perform an operation they would usually need the assistance of engineering for. This Op would be trackable, so the engineering team would have visibility into what is being run, but the marketing team would be unblocked to continue their tasks. </p><p>Adopting Ops has allowed Axial to immediately reduce their cloud spend, enable easier adoption of new technologies, and even open the door to empowering non-engineers to run operations. Ultimately, this allows the engineering team to focus on their core competency in the pursuit of their own market innovation instead of spending time and resources on infrastructure and tooling.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Contact us to understand how much time and money workflows can save your team:</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Half-way through 2012, you’d have been forgiven for thinking that Facebook was doing a MySpace. In other words, Facebook was on a fast path to slow, painful decline.</p>
<p>Yahoo had just sued Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-facebook-lawsuit/yahoo-sues-facebook-for-infringing-10-patents-idUSBRE82B18M20120312">for patent infringement</a>. Zuck - like Steve Jobs before him - had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">bet too early</a> on the mobile web, and Facebook’s HTML5-powered apps were slow and buggy. Some argued that Zuck had overpaid for Instagram - $1billion for a 12 person company with no revenue, valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/right-before-acquisition-instagram-closed-50m-at-a-500m-valuation-from-sequoia-thrive-greylock-and-benchmark/">half that amount</a> a week before Facebook bought it.</p>
<p>The share price was tanking, having lost more than half its value just 3 months after going public. In Q3 2012 the company posted a net loss - it’s second quarter as a public company. And, though more than 50% of monthly active users visited Facebook on mobile, those users generated almost no advertising revenue.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough to finish Facebook off, advertisers weren’t exactly flocking to it, either.</p>
<p>Google’s search ads had earned a reputation as “the new standard” in the world of direct response advertising. They were easy to buy, easy to optimise, and it was easy enough to measure the impact of them. Google had tapped directly into a “standards-based” form of brand advertising, too. Adsense enabled advertisers to buy - through auction, at scale - display ads in standard IAB formats across hundreds of thousands of websites. Plug in your existing messages and creative, pick your audience, and go. SMBs loved it.</p>

<em>Exactly how many questions could be a in a Question ad?</em></p>

<p>In stark contrast, Facebook ads were almost impossible to buy. There were 27 different ad units to choose from. Facebook’s “Ads and Sponsored Stories Guide” was <a href="https://allfacebook.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Facebook-Ads-and-Sponsored-Stories-Guide-Januar-2013.pdf">45 pages long</a>. To ensure maximum reach to Facebook’s audience on desktop and mobile, advertisers were required to create a gazillion images of various different dimensions and ratios. An infestation of bugs paused ad campaigns for no discernable reason (usually on Fridays, for entire weekends). Even worse, GM - one of the biggest brand advertisers on Facebook - publicly said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304192704577406394017764460">Facebook ads didn’t work</a>.</p>
<p>For a newly-listed company, with an advertising-based business model, the situation looked pretty bleak. Facebook was surely destined to join MySpace and Friendster in the dot-com deadpool.</p>
<p>Of course, as we now know, that never actually happened. Less than a year later, when Facebook announced Q2 2013 earnings, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553942/facebooks-q2-2013-earnings-beat-expectations-on-revenue-and-profit">stock shot up 21% in after hours trading</a> after an earnings beat. Mobile accounted for 41% of revenue, up from 30% the quarter before. Facebook reported its first quarter with over 1 million active advertisers. Advertising revenue in “International” markets (EMEA, APAC, and LATAM) was doubling year-over-year. ARPU - a helpful metric to understand advertising auction demand - was growing faster than ever ($1.60 in Q2 2013, it’s $7.26 today).</p>
<p>How the heck did that happen? Simple answer: some good old <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/wtf-is-a--platform/" title="What is a Platform?">platform thinking</a>. And rationalizing.</p>
<p>When Facebook’s Ads Product team solicited feedback from marketers, it came thick and fast. It wasn’t great. Creating campaigns was equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming. Marketers were already investing time and money to create “organic” content on Facebook, like Page Posts. Adding 27 ad formats to the mix would create additional “work-work” for them.</p>
<p>To build empathy with the people they were serving, Ads PMs started adding the likes of David Ogilvy and Marshall McLuhan to their “must read” lists. And they started talking to the Ads API ecosystem more. Turns out the “work-work” problem was affecting developers, too. There were multiple ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through Facebook’s Marketing APIs. Internal confusion had been externalised to them. Wasting time re-inventing the wheel and implementing a constant barrage of new, different ad formats ate up their innovation budget.</p>
<p>A simpler approach was required. Marketers, developers, and Facebook were counting on it.</p>

<em>Paul Adams (now SVP Product at Intercom) was a Facebook Ads PM around then, and used simple diagrams like this to explain the “messages, containers, channels” idea.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s Ads team quickly realised advertising on Facebook shouldn’t be all that different from advertising through any medium, old or new. It didn’t matter if was billboards, newspapers, magazines, leaflets, display ads, search ads, social ads, or emails, the basics were the same - marketers wanted to get messages in front of people, to drive a response.</p>
<p>The channels may vary, and containers within those channels may vary, but the messages and objectives were the same. And, of course, the best messages were those that started new relationships between businesses and customers.</p>
<p>This simple insight brought clarity to the conversation, and to the roadmap. Marketers were already creating “messages” on Facebook, after all - Page Posts. Instead of creating “ads” why not make it so that marketers could simply pay to get their existing messages in front of more people?</p>
<p>And, if these messages contained images - wasn’t that just the same thing as “ad creative?”</p>
<p>And, if these messages already appeared in users’ feeds, didn’t “feed” also mean “mobile feed”?</p>
<p>And, if marketers paid to promote these messages in “mobile feed,” aren’t they “mobile ads?”</p>
<p>The penny dropped.</p>
<p>For a self-proclaimed “platform company,” the approach to serving marketers and developers hadn’t been “platform-ey” at all. Lots of complexity, no consistency. Lots of distinct features were built, not rationalized capabilities. The feedback shared by marketers and developers was spot on - there <em>were</em> so many ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through every ads interface, not just Facebook’s APIs. An embarrassing oversight, but fixable with the right framework.</p>
<p>Changes came thick and fast. In June 2013, Fidji Simo penned - on behalf of the Ads Product team - “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2013/06/an-update-on-facebook-ads/">an update on Facebook Ads</a>.” She used words like <em>simplify</em>, <em>consistent</em>, <em>redundancies</em>, <em>streamline</em>, and <em>objectives</em> to describe what was changing. Messages and images would gracefully degrade, depending on where they were delivered to people. The number of ad units would be reduced from 27 to fewer than half of that. Her final sentence summarised the changes well:</p>
<p>“We think these updates will make it easier for them (marketers) to do what they do best: reach the right groups of people with the right message and drive the results they care most about.”</p>

<p><em>Different containers, different channels, same message.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that Fidji was right is a mild understatement. Since 2012, marketers have <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/2496/facebook-revenue-by-segment/">invested over $167billion in mobile advertising through Facebook</a>. In the 3rd quarter of 2019, mobile advertising represented 94% of Facebook’s overall advertising revenue. And, not all of that revenue came from the “big blue” Facebook app.</p>
<p>By simplifying the concept of a “message” reaching the “right groups of people” to “drive results,” advertisers could extend their advertising campaigns to Instagram and Facebook Audience Network with no additional effort. The messages they created would simply be presented in different types of containers, on different channels. When ads on Facebook Messenger appeared, the same messages created for Facebook and Instagram “gracefully degraded” to fit the containers on that new channel.</p>
<p>Even better, ads could quite literally be a new way to start a conversation with customers - through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It was easy. SMBs loved it.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there - life for developers improved, too. The process of integrating with Facebook’s Ads APIs became easier, and - by rationalizing across interfaces, including APIs - developers had more headspace and capacity to innovate. New Facebook Marketing Partners emerged with innovative solutions. Some, like Wix, created solutions to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/wixs-integration-with-facebook-lets-you-create-page-post-ad-campaigns-via-wix-shoutout-newsletters/">extend the reach of email marketing campaigns to Facebook</a>. Others, like StitcherAds and Smartly.io enabled marketers to create <a href="https://stitcherads.com/digital-circulars/">digital circulars</a> and <a href="https://www.smartly.io/">data-fuelled ad creative</a>. As of March 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/05/17/helsinki-born-kristo-ovaska-built-smartly-io-for-a-facebook-driven-ad-world/#799bce6d23df">almost $2 billion of Facebook’s annual revenue</a> flows through Smartly.io - just one partner, based in Finland. There are more like them.</p>
<p>Facebook may have solved the “reach the right groups of people with the right message” problem well for advertisers within their own walled garden, but that doesn’t mean they’ve solved it for every business in the world. These days, the volume of inbound and outbound messages - emails, SMS, WhatsApp, and the rest - is ever increasing. A challenge for everyone, not just marketers.</p>
<p>Every team, in every business, wrestles with an infinite stream of inbound messages, and outbound messages that need to land in various apps and inboxes, on a myriad of devices, formatted in different ways. The number of “channels” is exploding, not consolidating. These days, TikTok is the new Tencent, Twilio is the new Telephone. <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/browsers--not-apps--are-still-the-future-of-mobile/" title="Browsers, not apps, are still the future of mobile">WhatsApp and WeChat are the new browsers</a>. Email and SMS are alive and well. But, just like Facebook advertising back in the day, managing all of this can be equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming.</p>
<p>The likes of Twilio - now a $40billion market cap company - are using terms like <em>omni-channel</em>, <em>programmable conversations</em> and <em>conversational messaging</em> to describe their capability to process and route inbound messages to the right teams, and route outbound messages to recipients on the channels they are most engaged with. Channels they ingest from and output to include email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Telegram, and many, many more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it should be. “Graceful degradation” and orchestration of inbound and outbound messages across channels is uncannily similar to the “platform thinking” Facebook applied to create an entirely new multi-billion dollar mobile ads business.</p>
<p>This challenge, by itself, creates a market opportunity far greater than Facebook or Google's market cap. These days, the opportunity can be sized in terms of $trillions, …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><em>Written by Cody Burkard, Senior Security Consultant, mnemonic</em></p>

<h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p>mnemonic researchers have discovered a new technique for escalating privileges within Azure environments through the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory. Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.</p>

<h2>Cloud security != On-prem security</h2>
<p>As organizations continue to migrate parts or all of their infrastructure to the cloud, security personnel need to adapt and understand the threats related to this cloud transition. At first glance, this doesn’t appear all too complicated, and security teams can take similar approaches to networking security as they have in traditional on-premise networks: VPNs for connectivity, network segmentation, network security appliances, agents, hardened virtual machines, etc. While these are all valid security measures for cloud infrastructure, they don’t address security concerns related to the management of infrastructure and users in the cloud.</p>
<p>For example, consider an adversary that is targeting a VM on an internal Azure network. The adversary cannot gain network access to the private Azure VNet that the VM resides on, but finds the password to an account in Azure AD. If the compromised user account has access to modify the infrastructure within Azure, they can bypass network and host-level security controls. The adversary could simply update the VM so that they may access it, or directly execute code on it. This scenario is shown below:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">

    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This is a very simple example of pivoting into infrastructure through Azure’s “management plane”, which is used by legitimate users to manage infrastructure. This scenario is dependent on an adversary compromising an account in AAD that has privileges to run commands on VMs within the Azure infrastructure.</p>
<p>This may seem like a somewhat naïve and simple example given the requirement for a pre-compromised AAD account with special permissions in Azure. However, commonly successful techniques such as phishing, password cracking or identification of leaked secrets can lead to the compromise of an AAD account. If an account compromised using one of those techniques does not have administrative permissions, then the goal of the adversary is to identify some privileged escalation that helps them gain higher permissions.</p>
<p>The remainder of this blog post focuses on the topic of elevating privileges in Azure infrastructure with a previously compromised Azure AD account. A full summary of previous work on this topic will be contained in a future post, whereas this post will focus on a new technique targeting AAD dynamic groups.</p>

<h2>Some background on Azure Active Directory</h2>
<p>Let’s start by clearing the air about Azure vs Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD).</p>
<p>When we talk about Azure, many folks jump straight to thinking about Azure Active Directory, or even Office 365. This is a common point of confusion. Microsoft has a large cloud ecosystem that is tied together with identity management and authentication through Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory uses “tenants” to represent different organizations and environments within a company’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, and includes a collection of users, groups and rights.&nbsp; Any one tenant may be connected to a single Office365 account, any number of Azure subscriptions, Dynamics365, Outlook, and other Microsoft cloud services.</p>
<p>So while the same Azure AD users may be used for all of these services, Azure AD is <em>not</em> a part of Azure nor a part of Office 365. Azure AD is a separate entity that handles user management and authentication, and has tight integrations with other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>With this straight, let’s briefly cover a few other basic topics that are relevant for the privilege escalation technique.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Roles in Azure AD are top-level roles in the Microsoft Azure AD tenant for Azure AD users. At the time of writing this article, the assignment of some admin roles to Service Principal objects is also in preview. Azure AD roles allow users or service principals to perform actions including, but not limited, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing security groups</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>Accessing Azure infrastructure</li>
<li>Creating and managing Azure AD applications (Service Principals)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot illustrates some of these Azure AD Roles in Azure Portal:&nbsp;</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Azure RBAC Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Azure RBAC (role-based access control) roles govern access to the infrastructure deployed within Azure. This is a large and complicated topic, but the important thing to understand here is that RBAC roles determine what actions an Azure AD principal can take on specific resources deployed in Azure. For example, to deploy a VM, a user must be assigned an RBAC role that includes that action, such as owner or contributor.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Security Groups</strong></h3>
<p>In Azure AD, users can be added into logical groups to help with user and access management. Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD roles can then be assigned to these groups (Azure AD role assignments to groups is in preview at the time of writing). This means that any user that is added to a group will then inherit the roles assigned to that group.</p>

<h2>The technique – abusing dynamic groups</h2>
<p>While researching and testing Azure deployments, I stumbled upon an interesting privilege escalation vector: the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure AD.</p>
<h3><strong>What are dynamic groups?</strong></h3>
<p>Dynamic groups in Azure AD allow administrators to automatically assign group memberships to users based on attributes of that user. For example, if a company has two offices in Oslo and London, they may create security groups for each of their offices. They can use dynamic groups based on the user’s “city” attribute for this purpose, so that whenever a new user is added to Azure AD, they will automatically be added to one of these two groups.</p>
<p>The following picture shows how you would do this with a dynamic group rule:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This use case is fairly innocent. But let’s think of a more security sensitive case.</p>
<h3><strong>A real-world scenario for the attack</strong></h3>
<p>An organization creates a dynamic group called VM Contributors, which has VM Contributor Access scoped to the subscription:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now, this organization outsources all VM management to a company called “Bluefish”, and Bluefish uses the following naming convention:</p>

<p>To automate the process of Bluefish users being assigned VM Contributor, a rule is added to dynamically add any user with “bluefish” in the userPrincipalName (UPN) to the VM Contributor group. Seems reasonable and innocuous, since users cannot modify their UPN without appropriate access rights, and the organization has locked these down.</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Time to escalate some privileges</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s assume for our scenario that an adversary gains access to a low-privileged user in Azure AD, which resides in no groups or Azure RBAC roles. The compromised user has the “Global Reader” role, so the attacker can read configurations in the directory, but cannot change settings, and therefore cannot use traditional methods to change access rights to their own user, or to other users.</p>
<p>The attacker finds the dynamic membership rule, and wants to find a way to trigger the dynamic rule for an account they control. In short, the attacker needs to get the name “bluefish” in the UPN attribute of their user:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Since users with the Global Reader role cannot edit any configurations, the attacker cannot edit their own UPN and is stuck.</p>
<h3><strong>UPN</strong></h3>
<p>User Principal Names are based on user email addresses. I have identified dynamic groups based on this attribute in the past, and on the surface seems to be okay because users generally cannot change their own email addresses. This requires administrative privileges within Azure AD and a role such as “User Administrator”. However, there is a way around this…</p>
<h3><strong>Abusing Guest Accounts</strong></h3>
<p>By default, users in Azure AD can invite guest users to the directory. Since the UPN of a guest user is still based on email addresses, an adversary can simply create a new email address from any email provider, such as Gmail, that contains “bluefish” in the address. For example:</p>

<p>If the attacker invites this email to the azure tenant:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>And then accepts the invite, the user will become a user in the local directory with an interesting UPN:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now we can go into the portal and check our group assignments:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now the attacker has access to the testDynamicGroup, which assigns the VM contributor role through a dynamic group membership.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker starts with a Global Reader in Azure AD</li>
<li>The attacker finds a dynamic group with the VM Contributor role assigned
<ol>
<li>Membership is dynamic based on the string “bluefish” existing in the UPN</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacker can invite guests, as per the default setting</li>
<li>The attacker invites a guest Gmail account with bluefish in the address - <span data-e="D4B9BBB7FAB8BDB5B9B394BCA7BDB2B1A1B8B6B0A6B5BFA6A1B6B0B7"></span></li>
<li>The guest account triggers the dynamic group after accepting, and inherits the VM Contributor role in Azure RBAC</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Notes on dynamic group abuse</strong></h3>
<p>In this example, we show how dynamic groups based on a UPN can be abused using a guest account. However, there are many other attributes for determining dynamic group membership, and different types of attackers could abuse each. <strong>When setting up dynamic groups, consider whether lower privileged users or external attackers could modify the attributes that define that group.</strong></p>
<p>The following are other potential attack paths to modify user attributes on dynamic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD Connect Sync – An attacker may modify user attributes in an on-premise system, and Azure AD Connect …</li></ul></div></div>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit.

Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<figcaption>Pointillism I. Sublime Text 3.2.2, ImageMagick 7.0.8–59</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Pointillism II. Vim 8.0.1365, FFmpeg 4.1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-382" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Lots of applications require a Postgres database. Before you can install them, you will need a Postgres database. How do you pick the right Postgres for your application? There are a bewildering variety of possible ways to acquire a database running on a Postgres instance, but the biggest choice is “build or buy”: whether to install a Postgres version on your own or to purchase it as a service.</p><p>lakeFS is yet another Postgres application, so it requires a Postgres database. At Treeverse we decided for now to buy Postgres as a service. I’ll explain the factors why we decided, and how you might decide to whether or not to follow us.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#got-a-postgres"></a>Got a Postgres?</h2><p>If your organization already runs Postgres instances, they may well be the best choice: there can be extensive in-house experience and expertise already present. And you probably don’t need this guide.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expensive-as-a-service"></a>Expensive as a Service?</h2><p>The most common objection to buying a database as a service is sheer price: a DB instance from your cloud provider can cost more than&nbsp;<em>twice</em>&nbsp;the cost of the virtual machine instance that it runs on. Obviously you pay extra to get much more than just the virtualized resources: you get expertise, much of the ops, easier backup and clustering, sometimes even some features.</p><p>For pricing I believe we should prefer to&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;what is not a core part of our business. Pricing can actually make this decision easy. If the cost of buying Postgres as a service is a significant expenditure, then necessarily it is a core part of business — and clearly we need to develop the requisite in-house capability to support it. Otherwise cost is not a driving factor in the decision.</p><p>Even if you decide Postgres is a core capability for your organization, you may wish buy Postgres as a service for an initial ramp-up period, planning to move away later. While migrating database installations generally requires some downtime, this too is often a good choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#choices"></a>Choices</h2><p>Every cloud provider provides managed Postgres as a service:</p><ul><li>AWS provide RDS as well as clustered Postgres-compatible Aurora;</li><li>Azure provide Azure Database for PostgreSQL;</li><li>GCP provide Postgres on Cloud SQL</li></ul><p>Similarly, some hosting providers also have a Postgres as a service offering. If you are already using a hosting provider that offers Postgres — Heroku is one example — this can be a convenient choice.</p><p>Postgres maintain a page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/">PostgreSQL: Hosting Providers</a>&nbsp;that list a wide range of options for purchasing hosted solutions along with support. Additionally, many hosted application platforms offer Postgres.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expertise-and-ops"></a>Expertise and Ops</h2><p>Developing in-house expertise is often desirable, and not only as a means to save costs. For instance, by allowing rapid resolution of issues without having to go outside the organization, expertise reduces risk.</p><p>On the flip side, managing your in-house database carries an ops burden, which will include monitoring, backup, clustering, and versioning. The last can be particularly troubling: occasionally you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;need to upgrade Postgres on a running system.</p><p>A middle ground between buying a service and building it yourself is to contract the setup but manage ops in-house. I believe that unless you do database-related development, databases are generally a poor fit for this middle ground alternative. Contracting only the setup means you will take longer to build expertise in the database. Meanwhile you already start carrying the ops burden of the database.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions-and-extensions"></a>Versions and Extensions</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions"></a>Versions</h3><p>Buying from a large service provider appears to limit available versions. Currently, for example, the latest supported Postgres version is 12.4; the major release Postgres 12 was on 2019-10-03. Service providers have been slow to provide version 12:</p><ul><li>AWS RDS started supporting Postgres version 12 on 2020-03-31, and supports Postgres versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11; however Aurora clusters do not support version 12 yet;</li><li>Azure still supports only versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.11, and 11.6;</li><li>GCP started providing Postgres version 12 on 2020-05-21;</li><li>ElephantSQL supports Postgres version 12, but the free tier provides version 11.9.</li></ul><p>At the same time service providers can upgrade Postgres (and underlying OS) versions more transparently. This can be particularly useful for receiving patch releases. So low availability of newer Postgres versions is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a significant detriment. Of course, certain applications may require an absolutely latest version of Postgres, which may make it impossible to buy Postgres service.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>Numerous extensions are available for Postgres. Service providers provide the most popular of these. But they cannot provide all of them, and typically it is not possible to install new extensions that require compilation.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#applicability-to-lakefs"></a>Applicability to lakeFS</h3><p>To allow users flexibility, lakeFS requires only Postgres 11. So availability of versions and extensions does not influence choice of provider for a database intended to run only lakeFS.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#provisioning"></a>Provisioning</h2><p>Creating a new database instance with a service provider requires plenty of time. For example, on AWS RDS creating a small empty database instance can take 10 minutes. This is very reasonable for one-time setup of long-lived production and even staging environments.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#fast-setup-of-small-databases"></a>Fast setup of small databases</h3><p>For short-lived environments or for testing, it can take too long to set up a hosted database. Luckily Postgres is an isolated component and one installation may easily be replaced with another installation. If the database is small and the generated data is not particularly valuable then there are good alternatives with quick setup times. These include creating a new database on an existing Postgres database instance or even — when database instance performance is not critical — running a database instance inside a container. If you have permission to create a new database, both of these alternatives have equivalent setup times that are typically less than a second.</p><p>Using an existing database instance allows you to take advantage of existing setup and ops on that database instance. For example, it will be easy to backup your new database if the database already has backups, and clustering exists at the instance level. By the same token, an existing database instance will offer significantly lower isolation than a container.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>An example of creating new databases inside an existing database instance is the ElephantSQL free tier: you are allocated a database inside an existing instance and can see that other databases exist inside that instance. It uses Postgres roles to prevent data leakage (a side effect is that some operations are impossible, for instance any application that requires multiple roles).</p><p>An example of running a database instance inside a container is when running tests. Every test can create its own blank container running Postgres. This is probably the best solution for component testing: it offers complete isolation between tests, the database container is small, and it scales directly with the number of running tests.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#what-did-we-pick"></a>What did we pick?</h2><p>All our lakeFS instances currently use plain or Aurora Postgres on RDS:</p><ul><li>Our database usage is currently not high enough to justify the cost savings of running our own instances..</li><li>We build lakeFS, and supporting Postgres as a service is important to the product. So by design, lakeFS does not require latest-version features or esoteric extensions.</li><li>Our core business is currently to develop rather than to operate lakeFS; this is essentially the “ramp-up” time above.</li></ul><p>For isolation and speed of setup, our unit and component testing use a containerized Postgres instance.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="407" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w"><figcaption>Picking a database, like picking an elephant, can be hard but need not be intimidating</figcaption></figure></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a thread</a> wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Gellis goes through his findings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this YouTube video</a>. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>
<p><strong>(Note: For more, <a href="https://www.samueljscott.com/2019/02/26/fake-online-fake-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see my recent talk on how much of the Internet is fake</a>.)</strong></p>

</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Install the Nano text editor and curl</p><p><code>
sudo apt install nano curl
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>For deployment a cellular connection is really convenient, but for testing and initial setup and ethernet or WiFi connection is quicker to set up. If you are using a Wi-Fi adaptor for testing, disable Wi-Fi power management to improve connection stability.</p><p><code>
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>It will open a file with the following file</p><p><code>
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 3
</code></p><p>Disable Wi-Fi power saving by changing <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Get the IP address of your Jetson Nano by running</p><p><code>
ifconfig
</code></p><p>Restart the Jetson before continuing. Any command line operation from this point forward can be done either directly on the Nano with the keyboard, mouse and monitor, or you can use SSH from any computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have a running Nano, it’s time to jump into the computer vision software.<br></p><h2>How to Install OpenDataCam</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam">OpenDataCam</a> is an open source tool for computer vision analytics, that can track and count objects in almost any video feed. It is probably the easiest to use and setup tool that I have seen for this purpose. It is licensed under the permissive MIT license, which allows for use in commercial products.</p><p>‍<br>OpenDataCam runs on the Docker platform, and requires access to CUDA, Nvidia’s tool for running parallel processing tasks on GPUs. First we need to make sure CUDA is defined in the PATH on the Nano, by editing the <em>.bashrc</em> file</p><p><code>
sudo nano .bashrc
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Add the following two lines to the end of the file, then save and close it.</p><p><code>
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
</code></p><p>Increase swap partition size of the Jetson to 6 GB to improve performance and reliability</p><p><code>
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
cd installSwapfile
chmod 777 installSwapfile.sh
./installSwapfile.sh
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Install Docker-compose and dependencies</p><p><code>
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev python-openssl
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
</code></p><p>Allow docker to run on startup</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable docker
</code></p><p>Install OpenDataCam. You will be asked for your sudo password during this process, and it may take a while.</p><p><code>
mkdir ~/opendatacam
cd ~/opendatacam
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.1/docker/install-opendatacam.sh
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano
</code></p><h2>How to configure OpenDataCam</h2><p>Once the installation is complete, open Chromium and go to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network. Once OpenDataCam has started, you will see the following video feed. It is a demo file included in OpenDataCam and demonstrates its object detection capabilities. We’ll use this as an example to get familiar with the interface before changing the video feed for our specific use case.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889973b49b0b09f6e922_UFzR3FTem-uv1i--ef_6ImhdEpBDpt2KfhSRH-nKZV0pb-fzcXfRg8O0PQY3TbOj2PztqHk-4w3Vd2TxSfclRoaW-4s2Y4LzfuUgjATLtWqQF4bczSNDX8J6xo4QGwdqlm1tRpqq.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Click on the “Pathfinder” button in the upper left corner, and you will see the “tracks” generated by each car as it’s identified and tracked.<br></p><p>To count the vehicles, click the “Counter” button to add counting lines as shown below. These lines act as checkpoints, counting objects that pass over them. In the example below, I’ve added lines for oncoming, leaving, and crossing traffic. You can also toggle the direction of travel for objects to be counted, by clicking on the arrow in the centre of the line. To start counting, click the “Start recording” button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298899354fcf9d9df68f0d_GLWKyNi1Xs8Jq7lWGDHkCKCNnvh9syNBk2Lk-1gC1OEQEvHgJEs21VJ8oPYtk1Wc-nbns8Kj_GdcqaA25lKE2UaPU82ZRAQzUcFRCuBuUh23XW0RZsZaK3c3CIqIKH6-UhMRzuhd.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To increase the reliability of the counters, it is important to place them in areas with high detection confidence. By clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right-hand corner, you can activate the tracker accuracy heatmap, which will highlight the areas with the <strong>lowest</strong> detection confidence levels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2988983b96a20a4ae37c21_D6BXJhyf_Dj-V7Ee6Xfa5q2Np7CTB_E5WITOkrOwuLSi73JBZjK2gWLf5Iz36E1Bn71D6-om6ao_-lE2HugxczT_NT_y0ojc_2DHNJGRQnvQ3adJOsHddTUM8LhB3z7tXt8GVYzL.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889972d197251894544b_BuLB_wQ_upuv3Vg3rZMNuyXJmQ0GNx0UyaJB5cmIJ-uJbQEcKPVdKE56PmnNvJBW_ft_Dl2oio5QcaScWLRZoK506Yx-L4BfFnNc8uAo4cmMGXlW1jBLDMBAA_D5DD02V-ZifngK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means that you should avoid these areas when placing counting lines. It might also be a good idea to move the camera to a different perspective, or even improve the detection model using <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/training-yolo-for-object-detection-in-pytorch-with-your-custom-dataset-the-simple-way-1aa6f56cf7d9">transfer learning</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a sample video file that you want to test, you can simply drag and drop it into the OpenDataCam window and it will start playing the new file.<br></p><p>To use a webcam or IP camera stream, you need to <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">edit the config.json</a> file in ~/opendatacam/ to specify the desired video source. Complete details are available on the <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">OpenDataCam Github page</a>, including all the other settings you can change. For now will stick to the demo file while we link all the different parts of the project together, and I will describe the final setup I did for deployment at the end of the post.</p><p>To load and updated config file, restart the Docker container</p><p><code>
sudo docker-compose restart
</code></p><h2>How to Install Node-RED for Cloud Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>I want to collect traffic data in set intervals and store it for analysis. InfluxDB is a database solution built specifically for time series data, which is exactly what we get from OpenDataCam. It also has some built-in visualisation tools. You can install and run InfluxDB locally on the Jetson, but in a production environment we will likely have multiple sources of data, so sending it to the cloud for analysis makes more sense.<br></p><p>OpenDataCam provides a simple but effective <a href="https://opendatacam.github.io/opendatacam/apidoc/">API </a>for interacting with it and extracting data, but we need to create a simple app to do this. I’ll be using Node-RED, flow-based GUI wrapper for Node.js, which also allows us to see at a glance how data flows through the app, and quickly make changes</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298898cf4cb2839161f831_wUmPP-WAF2sNZpv2qt-pTAv6j4twJzsVmUR3MPQSDpX9roRV8JLq8PxcGqSejBnJc7z-RTxFWb7XIFEDAJNGIBgcPjBmHh4DDmMNuapQ3jL2agcDopb5UghwI4yRnsSB_TFLrEIp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The above screenshot gives you a good idea of how the flow works. First it checks the status of OpenDataCam (ODC), and starts it if it is not running yet, and if no recording is active, it starts one. If a recording is running, it retrieves the recording and then stop it, and immediately starts a new recording. The data from the completed recording is retrieved, and sent to InfluxDB.<br></p><p>This process is repeated at intervals set in the blue <em>timestamp</em> inject node. The dark green nodes provide output for debugging purposes.<br></p><p>To install Node-RED, open a terminal on your Jetson, and run:</p><p><code>
bash (curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
</code></p><p>Install additional nodes for easy interaction with InfluxDB</p><p><code>
cd ~/.node-red &amp;&amp; npm install node-red-contrib-stackhero-influxdb-v2
</code></p><p>We want to let Node-RED start automatically when the Jetson starts</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
</code></p><p>Start Node-RED as a background service</p><p><code>
node-red-start
</code></p><p>Open the Node-RED UI by going to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network.</p><p>To import the flow, click the menu icon in the upper right corner, and select <em>Import</em>.</p><p>Copy the flow code from this <a href="https://github.com/CuriousMongoose/opendatacam-nodered-influxdb/blob/master/nodered-flow.json">GitHub repo</a>, paste it into the import window, and click <em>Import</em>. The flow will now show in your Node-RED editor. Before we can deploy it, we need to set up InfluxDB to receive data, and get its authentication details.</p><h2>How to configure InfluxDB Cloud</h2><p>Now we need to set up a InfluxDB instance to receive the data. First go to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/">InfluxDB Cloud page</a>, register for a free account, and create an instance on the cloud platform of your choice. I used AWS.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889817f6f13ef9861283_iy66hKVJonggHuEE97zGCmEVwrBnvAR0HzJKug2-sTenFZKkAqmzCzpErKJZ_FLEBe6JGaS8v3kr9Kg05pUCwDJKJtK-cwoFw27Jr4ULD90M90_tiYSn5X5kffZhbMXp1udSCsFR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once the instance is created and you are logged in, go to the <em>Buckets</em> tab on the <em>Dat…</em></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Secrets in version control systems (VCS) like git is the current state of the world <strong>despite widely being recognized as a bad practice</strong>. Once source code enters a git repository, it can organically spread into multiple locations. This includes any secrets that may be included within. But why then are secrets in git repositories so common? </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles about secrets within source code and will look specifically at why secrets within git repositories is such a plague, why it is so dangerous and how to prevent it. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="1"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-end-up-in-git">Why secrets end up in git</h2><p>A seasoned developer may be scratching their heads wondering why anyone may put secrets inside a git repository. <strong>But the fact is, secrets inside git repositories is the current state of the world. </strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secret-sprawl/">Last article</a> we talked about how it is common to choose the path of least resistance when it comes to accessing and distributing secrets. <strong>Git acts as the central point of truth for a project</strong>, so it makes sense, at least from a convenience point of view, that secrets are stored inside a private git repository to make distribution and access easy. </p><blockquote>But storing secrets like this is playing with fire, it only takes a very small incident to get burnt. </blockquote><p>In addition to intentionally storing secrets in git, <strong>when secrets are not managed properly, it is very easy to lose track of them</strong>. Secrets may be hardcoded into source code, stored as text file, shared over Slack or buried inside a debug application log. In addition, developers can be in large distributed teams with access to a plethora of secrets while being faced with reduced release cycles and an ever growing number of technologies to master. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="2"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-in-git-is-dangerous">Why secrets in git is dangerous</h2><p>Source code, we have to remember, is very leaky. Code is copied and transferred everywhere. Git is designed in a way that allows, even promotes, code to be freely distributed. </p><p>Projects can be cloned onto multiple machines, forked into new projects, &nbsp;distributed to customers, made public so on and so forth. <strong>Each time it’s duplicated on git, the entire history of that project is also duplicated.</strong></p><p>Why storing secrets in public repositories is bad will be obvious. They are freely available to everyone on the internet and it is very easy to monitor public repositories, GitHub has a public API to fetch all public commits for example. <br></p><p><strong>But what about private git repositories?</strong><br></p><p>Private repositories don’t publish your source code to the internet openly, but it doesn’t have adequate protection to store such sensitive information either. <strong>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository, secrets are just as sensitive. </strong></p><p><strong>A few things to consider when storing secrets in private repositories:</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone in the organization with access to the repo has access to the secrets within (one compromised account can provide an attacker access to a trove of secrets).</li><li>Repositories can be cloned onto multiple machines or forked into new projects.</li><li>Private repositories can be made public which can have secrets buried in the git history.</li></ul><p>Another important consideration is that <em><strong>code removed from a git repository is never actually gone.</strong></em></p><p>Git keeps track of all changes that are made. Code that is removed - or more technically correct: code that is committed over - still exists within the git history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, code is removed from a project at near equal volume that is added. This means that the code within repositories are much deeper than the first layer and secrets could be buried deep within the git history under a mass of commits that have been long forgotten. </p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iPPNU4jrj_CRg3G1zdZ8dFranXUHL7uDUvUk3c3IoLgp-Ub4iNPrpxe8JGjXBl1ntarRIy1Izu5FByy8OFzOOQr8gQA5OCnnvaG_p20IOPQQmaDpHX2LyLJ6IRI0laPFlIs-Ez0O" alt="git history added files and deleted files"><figcaption>git contributions graph</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency"><em>https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency</em></a><em> </em><br></p><blockquote>Comment: The contributions graph that you see above from HashiCorp Vault repository is a typical view of a project's history.

And that's just within public repositories.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5WbkGwTV2zn3HJ-qtHQu8nJFOkjyd5zSdh2CRAemcZLaxw7N7KILSMhpjmdCKyxpwAjVokYUWKooWKJ4CYdK3_GmAgieNFx-5I7qDTXUcNCTsfwemi9Qum9-4qkKd5IV0bqEhqkZ" alt="Removed AWS keys search on GitHub"><figcaption>GitHub commit remove credential</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/search?q=removed+aws+key&amp;type=Commits">https://github.com/search?q=removed+aws+key&amp;type=Commits</a></p><p>GitGuardian detects over 3,000 leaked secrets each day within public GitHub alone, there are thousands of examples for this but below are a couple recent or noteworthy examples.</p><p><em>Publicly disclosed examples of recent data breaches through leaked credentials.</em></p><blockquote><strong>Starbucks Data Breach - January 2020 </strong><br><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/716292">JumpCloud API key found in GitHub repository</a></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Equifax Data Breach - April 2020</strong><br><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/694931">leaked secrets in personal GitHub account granted access to sensitive data for equifax customers</a></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Uber Data Breach - October 2016</strong><br><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/federal_register_notices/2018/04/152_3054_uber_revised_consent_analysis_pub_frn.pdf">Poor password hygiene allowed intruders to access Uber’s Amazon S3 Datastore using an AWS access key posted in a private GitHub repository.</a></blockquote><p>If this seems like an issue for only large companies to worry about, it’s not. Attackers are constantly exploiting personal services through secret keys too. In one example, <strong>bad actors scanned GitHub for AWS keys and used them to mine cryptocurrency, leaving <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/">developers with thousands of dollars in debt</a></strong>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[RESEARCH IN PROGRESS] We "forgot" to hide AWS keys in the code of a public repo on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> .

</figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="4"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="detecting-secrets-in-reviews-or-not-">Detecting secrets in reviews (or not)</h2><p>One great advantage of git is to be able to quickly and clearly see changes made and compare previous and proposed code states. It’s therefore common to believe that if secrets are leaked in source code, they of course will be detected within a code review or in a pull request.</p><blockquote>Code reviews are great for detecting logic flaws, maintaining good coding practices and keeping code quality high. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets. </blockquote><p>This is because reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed state. Not the entire history of a branch. Branches are commonly cleaned before being merged into the master branch, temporary code is added then deleted, unnecessary files added then removed.. But now these files, which are high risk candidates for containing secrets, are not visible to the reviewer (unless they want to go through the entire history of a branch). <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XZOq-SU3EwpmQM6YEo52h7jk1vUM99PL-IJSs5wbRfioPpiAqIl8Ss2zm6MhZPWGLQ8bv_52YMcMB-qPGhb98e0b52cYMNJQYJB8-FXTE1URxxa9g5_2gpwmqT2iqySjDYXhrfCe" alt="Looking for secrets in git history"><figcaption>Git code review diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Let's walk through the example above. While this is over simplified it tells a familiar story. </p><p><br>Commit B a file named main.py is added. A new branch is created to add a new function to main.py in commit C, this feature uses an API key so to save time for testing this is hardcoded. Once the feature is working the hardcoded API key is replaced with an env variable and the file is cleaned. Finally a pull request is made and accepted because the reviewer looks at the net difference between commit B and D, ignoring commit C. Now undetected secrets are buried in the git history of the project.</p><p>While this scenario is very basic, add in hundreds of commits and files between master and a development branch and you can see how easy it is to miss secrets in code reviews. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow.

</figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="5"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="using-automated-detection-to-find-secrets-in-git">Using automated detection to find secrets in git</h2><p>Taking in consideration all we have just discussed about secrets inside git, it is clear that this is a problem that will persist and one we cannot solve with human code reviews. While automation is not always the answer, detecting secrets, in particular secrets inside git, automated secrets detection is a clear solution to this widespread problem. </p><p>Unfortunately detecting secrets in git is not quite as easy as it first seems because of the probabilistic nature of secrets. This makes it hard to distinguish between a true secret and other random-looking strings like database IDs or other hashes.</p><p>The good news however, is that <a href="https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian</a> has built powerful tools for developers to detect secrets in git. A great dashboard with native GitHub and GitLab integrations, a CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield">GG-Shield</a> or you can even build custom your own git secrets scanner using the <a href="https://api.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian API</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Let’s have a quick review of what we have gone through. Git repositories are very common places to find secrets and they remain the perfect incubator for secrets to sprawl into multiple locations. Git keeps a track of a project's history which can be deep making finding secrets difficult. Because of the workflow git creates, it is common for any secrets to be missed during manual checking procedures and automated secrets detection should be introduced into the SDLC.</p><p>Curious of how secrets detection works? Next episode in the secrets in source code series we are going to dive into the mechanics of secrets detection including why probabilistic algorithms are so tricky and the secret sauce behind making them work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

September 8, 2020 | https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomgamon.com/posts/a-losers-game/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

<![CDATA[Git/serve: A Git server for Plan 9]]>
            </title>

September 7, 2020 | https://orib.dev/gitserve.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://orib.dev/gitserve.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that.

And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time.
