                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been wanting to do a Show HN for my robotics developer tool <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/">Yoga Studio</a> for a while.
But given that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s for programming robots</li>
  <li>you probably don’t have a compatible robot</li>
</ul>

<p>it wasn’t something you could immediately play with.</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/greppy1tlb_300px.jpg" width="150" height="317"></p>

<p>Now, you have <strong>remote access to a robot</strong> you can program with it! The 2-wheeled balancing robot (“Greppy”) is sitting in
our California warehouse ready to run your code. You’ll need to download and build
Yoga Studio to control it – see full instructions below.</p>

<p>When you check out the code, it includes an <code>examples/greppy</code> directory with some code to
make the robot balance and drive around. When you start the app and click “Run Live”, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connects to the robot through a port in our firewall.</li>
  <li>Acquires a lock (only one user at a time. Don’t bogart the robot!)</li>
  <li>Uploads <strong>your code</strong> to the robot (start with the example code, but you can hack it up later.)</li>
  <li>The robot compiles and runs your code</li>
  <li>The robot <strong>streams live traces</strong> of all the sensors and computations done by the code, and also a video from a camera looking at the robot.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>drive the robot</strong> with WASD.</li>
  <li>The bottom pane shows the code running, along with <strong>current values for every expression</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the code pane, numerical parameters are overlaid with gui sliders. <strong>You can drag them around and they’re immediately updated on the robot</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you’re done, hit Escape and it’ll download the high-res traces to your machine.</li>
  <li>While viewing a saved trace, you can adjust parameters and it’ll overlay a counterfactual graph of <strong>what the code would have done</strong> with the new parameters.</li>
  <li>The Yoga language is fully <strong>differentiable WRT its parameters</strong> so you can click on an output variable
 (like motor speed) and it’ll tell you what parameters you should change in which direction to affect it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>This is part of a project to make programming robots faster. My experience is that tuning the parameters of
robot control code takes 10x longer than getting the structure of the code right, so I designed a
language + IDE with a single-minded focus on solving the parameter problem. The language is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differentiable with respect to its parameters</li>
  <li>Fast (statically typed and compiled)</li>
  <li>Purely functional (no side effects)</li>
  <li>Close enough to C for your editor’s syntax highlighting to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler extracts anything marked as a parameter into a separate data structure, with a link to the location
in the source code they came from. When the IDE renders the Yoga code, it shows the parameters as sliders.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td> Code Editor </td>
      <td> Yoga Studio </td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="https://yoga.dev/images/paramdemo_raw.png" width="331" height="123" alt="Parameters as text">
      </td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here’s what Yoga Studio looks like when controlling Greppy:</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/ScreenshotAnno@2x.png" width="740" height="485"></p>

<p>Feel free to hack on the code in <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/-/tree/master/examples/greppy">examples/greppy</a>. See if you can make the robot do something cool!</p>

<p>Read more in the <a href="https://yoga.dev/yoga/">Reference Manual</a>.</p>



<p>It should work on either Mac or Linux (Recently tested on Catalina and Ubuntu 19.10 &amp; 20.04).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone <span>--recurse-submodules</span> https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2.git
<span>cd </span>yoga2
git config submodule.recurse <span>true
</span>make install.deps <span># On Mac, uses Brew. On Linux, apt-get.</span>
make <span>-j8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now fire up the Greppy example code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bin/yogastudio examples/greppy/main.yoga
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Click “Run live on on robot greppy1”.</p>

<p>It’ll then open up the real-time scope, showing live-scrolling graphs of several variables over time. And the video will show the robot starting to balance.</p>

<p>The greppy example code lets you drive the robot from your keyboard with WASD.</p>

<p>Try going to the <code>balance.yoga</code> file, and adjusting the first 2 parameters in the RHS of the assignment to <code>accel</code>. Those are roughly the P and D parameters of the main balance feedback loop. Start with
small adjustments and work up to large ones! The robot is attached to the ceiling with a rope, so you can’t do too much damage.</p>

<p>Hit Esc to end the live session, and switch to the recorded traces it just captured.</p>

<p>You can scroll back and forth in the recorded traces by scrolling left-right with your mouse. You can add or remove traces from the graph with the checkboxes on the left.</p>

<p>While looking at recorded traces, you can still drag parameters, but now rather than updating on the live robot, they <strong>redo the entire run</strong>, overlaying the counterfactual graphs. That is, it shows what the code would have done with the new parameters given the same inputs from the hardware.</p>

<p>To start another run on the hardware, hit Cmd-L (Ctl-L on Linux).</p>

<p>When you’re happy with the parameters, click “Save params” to write them back to the source code. If you’re following the example, that’ll be in the checked out directory under examples/greppy/</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>We started Repl.it to break down what we thought of as needless barriers to start coding. Naturally, our first product was the repl -- a simple editor and console for evaluating code. Turns out that’s all our users needed to learn enough coding to make meaningful programs. From there, Repl.it started to grow incredibly fast among students, developers, and educators. As we watched what our most active users did with the platform, a pattern emerged around coding in the classroom: teachers would prepare a doc or a PDF with instructions and a base repl for their students to fork. Students then would open the PDF side-by-side with the repl and start coding. When finished, they would copy the link and email it back to their teachers. Finally, teachers would block off an afternoon to evaluate and give feedback on their students’ code. The process, while better than using a local IDE and passing around files, seemed tedious and we wanted to solve it -- that’s how <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">Repl.it Classroom</a> emerged.</p>
<p>Repl.it Classroom digitized and streamlined the workflow teachers already had in the classroom. However, although teachers loved the experience and Classroom began to grow a slight tension emerged: Classroom used a custom environment which was hard to evolve in tandem with the repl environment. Right now repls are so far ahead in terms of IDE and runtime features that it makes more sense to consolidate and build our education platform on top of repls. Especially with the introduction of Multiplayer, we’ve seen teachers use both -- Classroom for small assignments and repls for projects. This works okay but the experience feels disjointed and hard to manage. That’s why today we’re excited to introduce Repl.it Teams, specifically Repl.it Teams for education which is jam-packed with features that will make teaching and collaborating on Repl.it nothing short of a seamless and amazing experience. </p>
<p><em>We believe that by propelling coding out of the old world of IDE setup and emailing code files, Repl.it Teams will be seen as the most significant innovation in CS and programming education.</em></p>
<p>In this post, we’ll go over what upgrading to Teams for education will get you, some details on pricing, and release timeline and roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer-by-default">Multiplayer by default</h2>
<p>Multiplayer is the fastest growing feature on Replit. Teachers and students who already use Google Docs will instantly see how game-changing this is for coding. Especially now, with the rise of distance learning, it’s more important than ever to have a real-time collaboration system. </p>
<p>Where this gets really interesting with Teams is that repls created in the team are multiplayer by default, which means teachers can “drop-in” into the student repl and see what student(s) are working on and provide direction in real-time. Imagine teachers walking around the class looking at students coding and providing feedback behind their shoulders, but all virtually. We even took it a step further so that teachers have access to their students’ entire codebase and have the ability to run their code or fork it if they need to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/typing.gif" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>Upgrading to Teams will give you a sense of presence over your classroom and will make collaboration a breeze. </p>

<p>Right now in Classroom assignments are a flat list which gives very little in the way of organizing your course into units. With Teams, you’ll be able to create as many folders in your shared Team as you need to. You can also easily create your own private folders and repls and move repls into the shared team folder as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/folders.png" alt="folders"></p>
<h2 id="conversations-around-code">Conversations around code</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things that Repl.it classrooms introduced to the teacher workflow is the assignment-submission workflow along with the notifications you get when your students submit an assignment. </p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So glad I made the jump to <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> for Higher computing. Young folk seem engaged, and I'm getting far too excited every time an assignment notification comes in 😄</p>— Fraser McKay (@mrmckaycomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmckaycomp/status/1271426729358381057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We’re looking to go even further with Teams. We want to build a new way to have conversations around code. Comments on code should not be disembodied (like they are in the classroom). They should be contextual, and you should be able to easily mention your student, TA, or collaborator. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/mention.png" alt="mentions"></p>
<p>This is still in early development, but once it lands, upgrading to Team will give you the ability to give contextual feedback on code. </p>
<h2 id="code-centered-discussion-boards">Code-centered discussion boards</h2>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/talk">Repl Talk</a>, our code-centered forum, started out when we noticed our users wanted to help each other by answering questions, sharing programs, and finding mentors and collaborators. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/qa.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teams will ship with its own discussion board instance private for you and your students for Q&amp;A, sharing, and discussion. </p>
<h2 id="expanded-language-support">Expanded language support</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that Classroom includes only a subset of the <a href="https://repl.it/languages">languages</a> that we support, and that’s because it takes a lot of effort to integrate a language into a bespoke environment. However, the Repl.it IDE is generic enough that languages are much easier to add. And even if we don’t support your favorite language, you’ll likely be able to get it working on our base bash repl--many of our users have done before. </p>
<p>Additionally, the repl text editor is based on VSCode’s Monaco which ships a lot of useful editing shortcuts, better syntax highlighting support, and, for some selection of languages, advanced <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel">code intellisense</a>. </p>
<p>On top of that, you'll get access to the ever-increasing selection of <a href="https://repl.it/templates">starter templates</a> -- from frameworks like Rails and Django to personal blogs and bots.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/templates.png" alt="languages"></p>
<p>In short, upgrading to Repl.it Teams will net you a 2x+ increase in language &amp; template selection and a much smoother editing experience.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-support">Mobile support</h2>
<p>When the pandemic hit and students around the world were forced to stay in and learn from home, we were saddened to hear that many students lost access to desktop computers. Luckily they had access to smartphones, and while mobile support wasn’t the best on Repl.it we worked really hard to improve it. It’s now so easy to code from your phone that you can code and spin up a website all from your phone’s web browser. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.repl.it/mobile"><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/mobile/preview.png" alt="mobile"></a></p>
<p>This is only the start. We’ll continue to invest in mobile coding because making programming more accessible is a core part of our mission. Upgrading to Teams will allow your students to code on the go, and, for those less fortunate who don’t have a computer at home, they will be able to continue learning uninterrupted.</p>
<h2 id="native-graphics">Native Graphics</h2>
<p>As coding moves to the cloud, we risk losing some of what makes programming special. As much as we like web programming, it’s not always the easiest to teach or learn. Graphics and game frameworks like <a href="https://repl.it/languages/pygame">PyGame</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/languages/love2d">LOVE2D</a> make making games a joy. That’s why Repl.it not only supports popular game frameworks but also anything that would want to render to native graphics drivers like Python’s <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/python-plots">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>Once you upgrade to Teams we bet it would be a lot of fun to build games with your students, teach them plotting, and overall engage in some of the most fun aspects of programming.</p>
<h2 id="team-profile">Team profile</h2>
<p>It's always cool to show off that you belong to one team or another, that's why you'll get to have a Team Profile complete with an avatar and "pinned" repls. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/profile.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teachers and students under the team will also get a nice profile icon that shows affiliation with the team!</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub being the world’s largest code repository hosting, we made it so that you can bring in any repo, configure it, and run it in under a minute without leaving your browser.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2fZ_B6juNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p> Not only does Repl.it integrates with Github very well, but we also partnered with the fine folks at GitHub education to make learning to code a breeze with Repl.it + GitHub Classroom. Read more <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/">about it here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/github-classroom/demo.gif" alt="GitHub Integration with Repl.it"></p>
<p>In addition to code-hosting, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> provides auto-grading functionality (similar to Repl.it Classroom) and makes it easy to manage your classroom and assignments.</p>

<p>So now that we’ve walked you through some of the benefits of Teams, let’s talk about what this means for the Classroom product. <strong>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’d never take it away or deprecate before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams</strong>. We are, though, building Teams to be a superior experience and a superset of what Classroom currently provides.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Repl.it, or about to introduce it for the first time to your classroom then we suggest you start out with the Teams product, and where it’s lacking -- the biggest thing would be auto-grading and learning management -- supplement it with a combination of <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>, or your own LMS like Google Classroom. </p>

<p>It’s our goal to get Repl.it into the hands of every code learner in the world. We really believe there’s not a better tool for teaching or learning to code. </p>
<p>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’ll never take it away or deprecate it before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams. So if you're an existing Repl.it Classroom subscriber (free or paid), this doesn't change anything for you. Any new customers will have to subscribe to teams in order to get access to Classroom.</p>
<p>So that all said, in order to make it easy and so you don’t have to worry about how many students will be in your class from semester to semester, we’ve simplified our pricing for educational institutions with an affordable flat rate. And it's cheaper!</p>
<p><strong>Pricing tiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single-classroom teachers (up to 50 students): <strong>$20/month</strong></li>
<li>College professors (up to 250 students): <strong>$50/month</strong></li>
<li>Schools and departments (unlimited students): <strong>$100/month</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you’re used to having to get annual budget approval or pausing your edtech subscriptions over the summer, we’ll give you two months off for an annual plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>50 students: <del>$240</del> <strong>$200/year</strong></li>
<li>250 students: <del>$600</del> <strong>$500/year</strong></li>
<li>Unlimited: <del>$1,200</del> <strong>$1,000/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><span><em>This is an ongoing development series about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">CHAOTIC ERA</a>, an interstellar strategy game. <strong><a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/subscribe">Join the beta waitlist here</a></strong> or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_era" aria-describedby="a11y-external-message"><strong>follow us on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;for the latest updates.</em></span></p>
<p><span>It’s often said that the meaning of a piece of art comes after it’s been made—the audience assigns their own ideas and emotions to it; they see trends and patterns that not even the original artist was aware of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just as in painting or sculpture or songwriting, the same principles apply to the art form of game design. Whatever a developer has in their head when they’re creating a game is only half the equation. The art direction, the gameplay, the end goal they have in mind… while these are important factors, ultimately there will also be inspiration beneath the surface, deep within their subconscious, that find their way into a game whether they’re aware of it or not.</span></p>
<p><span>This has definitely been the case for <a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">Chaotic Era</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When we first started work on the game years ago, we had a vague notion of what the final product should look like. We wanted to build a strategy game on an epic scale; one that would take place across an entire universe.</span></p>
<p><span>We wanted to capture the mystique and vastness and excitement of games like No Man’s Sky and Elite Dangerous while working in ideas from our favourite sci-fi classics.</span></p>
<p><span>And in our first phase of development, where we mostly focused on navigation UI and worldbuilding, those influences couldn’t be more clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Our minimal FUI design combined our love for the retrofuture of Blade Runner and Alien, with the modern interfaces of fighter jets and helicopters. The AI-worshipping interstellar universe dominated by shadowy corporations drew from a wide range of sources like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Battletech, and Dune.</span></p>

<p><span><em>Image via <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/">www.scifiinterfaces.com</a></em><br></span></p>
<p><span>But once we started getting into the nuts and bolts of the game—the actual gameplay and game rules—we started making our way down a rabbit hole with little idea of where we might end up.</span></p>
<p><span>Each exploration started to take on a life of its own as we began adding components that felt like they made sense.</span></p>
<p><span>How would you build new ships? Well, I guess we need worker units. Where do worker units come from? Well, I guess we need building units that house workers. And those workers require population and energy to produce. And energy comes from reservoirs you discover, and harvest with those same workers.</span></p>
<p><span>And so on it went, until we came to our current point in time: with a fleshed out game experience whose influences surprised us.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we were able to look back on what we built, we quickly began to retrospectively see patterns that we weren’t even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span>Our isometric grid, world planning, and disasters? We realized those were pulled out of ninth grade memories spent beating Sim City 2000 in computer labs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Worker units created by factories, sent to harvest resources, and used to construct new buildings? Hours sank into Starcraft were surfacing in unexpected ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Without even realizing, but thankfully so, we were building a strategy game that was subconsciously heavily influenced by some of our favourite RTS trailblazers: Sim City 2000, Starcraft, Command &amp; Conquer, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/71104_screenhi_930x524_en_US_01___2014-04-01-11-01-16_088f82de4701f05aa0a16904261a1f3be30ae43b_grande.jpg?v=1593361854"></span></p>
<p><span>Each planet in Chaotic Era is like its own Sim City or Starcraft match; the main difference being here that as you expand your empire, you’ll find yourself balancing many matches at once. And those matches will suddenly have complex interdependencies and domino effects based on the decisions you make, or don’t make.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that I feel like if we had intentionally set out to create a game that emulates these classics of the genre, then we would’ve ended up with an end product much flatter and less exciting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By chasing a notion of what we wanted to build—looking at the world and feelings we were trying to evoke—we let our minds pull together these influences without even realizing, ultimately creating something that we’re incredibly proud of (and constantly surprised by). We weren’t forcing building blocks together, instead we were chipping away at marble and uncovering the hidden forms underneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, it’s been a while since our last progress update, so I wanted to cover a few things along the lines of how early real time strategy games have been driving our recent game design.</span></p>
<h2><b>Changes in visual direction for planets</b></h2>
<p><span>At lower levels of elevation, the camera aligns to an isometric, 45º point of view, allowing the player to see a different level of detail than when zoomed out. As well, a subtle "ground" texture has been added to suggest terrain, populated by perlin noise.</span></p>

<p><span>A dust effect was explored as well, inspired by the ground conditions of a comet captured by a European probe:</span></p>

<p><span>Outline shaders were explored but ultimately dropped due to difficulty required to achieve a certain level of quality, but also additional visual noise that would be introduced. The shader will be re-examined when there's an opportunity to display models in higher levels of detail (ie. a "unit details" view)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932750-e3815d80-8d8e-11ea-9e25-8029bd3a9bf2.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Garage tiles</b></h2>
<p><span>Introduces a finite grid to the garage which consists of tiles that are owned by the player, not owned but purchasable, not purchasable and not owned, and unknown. The majority of the "board" consists of unknown tiles, acting as a fog of war mechanic. Tiles that are unowned but purchasable are represented by a single dot and when tapped, are purchased for a fixed price immediately.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932925-8cc85380-8d8f-11ea-8c33-5c44c285691c.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The previous set of rules dictating validity of a unit's position have been adjusted too, now discriminating against a few more rules than before, such as whether or not a tile is unowned, non-purchasable, or of an unknown state.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933612-7ff92f00-8d92-11ea-8525-028ca760aeb7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Workers</b></h2>
<p><span>A new Unit class and mechanic has been introduced, </span><span>TileUnit</span><span> and </span><span>Tile</span><span> respectively. </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can be purchased in the same way </span><span>ShipUnits</span><span> can be purchased, and placed in the garage in the same way too. The only difference is </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can produce </span><span>Workers</span><span> which are required for performing various functions, starting with terraforming the surface of a single body so additional units can be placed. This is all in the vein of making energy and population generation/consumption more transparent, where there will eventually be a unit for generating energy and population, and population will be literally countable by the number of worker units in a single garage.</span></p>
<p><span>This work began with exploring how to subdivide a 2D cell into n subdivisions, and creating connected pathways across the lengths of the cell for workers to travel across.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935377-11d7cb80-a787-11ea-8830-a29d29d24d51.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The step after this was investigating how to fill available space around the paths with as large shapes as possible in order to fill them with decorative elements such as tents and satellites.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935379-18fed980-a787-11ea-9da6-7db9d2276ff8.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>From here, it was a matter of figuring out a way to place assets in these available spaces.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935407-55323a00-a787-11ea-8a1e-f210ca71be6f.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Work was then done to ensure entrances were calculated by neighbouring entrances to ensure seamlessness of interlocking tiles.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935428-8448ab80-a787-11ea-8215-a56dcb77b5d7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The final result was actually inserting worker units and their assets and having them follow these paths towards assigned targets.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935451-b0642c80-a787-11ea-9d9c-3a2618e3fb11.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>This involved a new Job-Worker design which now gets encoded to save files. The user creates jobs by performing an action like clicking an available cell, and a new </span><span>Foreman</span><span> class takes inventory of "idle" workers, dynamically assigning workers closest to the job location, or reassigning assigned workers by pulling them off a job they are already stationed at.</span></p>
<p><span>This design will need to continue evolving over the next few months to fill in functionality gaps, such as the ability to move and perform work while the game is closed. This and many more aspects will be refined as unknowns are uncovered.</span></p>

<![CDATA[Top Concerns When Choosing a Tech Stack for Your Personal Website]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>People are amazing creatures. When discussing a complex issue, they are able to keep multiple independent
arguments in their heads, the pieces of supporting and disproving evidence, and can collapse this system
into a concrete solution. We can spend hours navigating through the issue comments on Github, reconstructing
the points of view, and making sense of the discussion. Problem is: we don’t actually want to apply this
superpower and waste time nearly as often.</p>

<h2 id="problem-with-technical-discussions">Problem with technical discussions</h2>

<p>Have you heard of <code>async</code> in Rust? Ever wondered why the core team opted into a completely new syntax for this feature? Let’s dive in and find out! Here is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640">#57640</a> with 512 comments, kindly asking everyone to check <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547">#50547</a> (with just 308 comments) before expressing their point of view. Following this discussion must have been exhausting. I don’t know how it would be possible to navigate it without the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456624074">summary</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456625030">comments</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is the loop syntax in WebGPU. Issue <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569">#569</a> has only 70 comments, with multiple attempts to <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569#issuecomment-610041440">summarize</a> the discussion in the middle. It would probably take a few hours at the minimum to get a gist of the group reasoning for somebody from the outside. And that doesn’t include the call transcripts.</p>

<p>Github has emojis which allow certain comments to show more support. Unfortunately, our nature is such that comments are getting liked when we agree with them, not when they advance the discussion in a constructive way. They are all over the place and don’t really help.</p>

<p>What would help though is having a non-linear structure for the discussion. Trees! They make following HN and Reddit threads much easier, but they too have problems. Sometimes, a really important comment is buried deep in one of the branches. Plus, trees don’t work well for a dialog, when there is some back-and-forth between people.</p>

<p>That brings us to the point: most technical discussions are <em>terrible</em>. Not in a sense that people can’t make good points and progress through it, but rather that there is no structure to a discussion, and it’s too hard to follow. What I see in reality is a lot of focus from a very few dedicated people, and delegation by the other ones to those focused. Many views get misrepresented, and many perspectives never heard, because the flow of comments quickly filters out most potential participants.</p>

<h2 id="structured-discussion">Structured discussion</h2>

<p>My first stop in the search of a solution was on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. It is successfully used by many communities, including <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust users</a>. Unfortunately, it still has linear structure, and doesn’t bring a lot to the table on top of Github. Try following <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-2020-growth/34956">this discussion
</a> about Rust in 2020 for example.</p>

<p>Then I looked at platforms designed specifically for a structured argumentation. One of the most popular today is <a href="https://www.kialo.com/">Kialo</a>. I haven’t done a good evaluation on it, but it seemed that Kialo isn’t targeted at engineers, and it’s a platform that we’d have to register in for use. Wishing to use Markdown with a system like that, I stumbled upon <a href="https://argdown.org/">Argdown</a>, and realized that it concluded my search.</p>

<p>Argdown introduces a syntax for defining the structure of an argument in text. Statements, arguments, propositions, conclusions - it has it all, written simply in your text editor (especially if its VSCode, for which there is a plugin), or in the <a href="https://argdown.org/sandbox/html">playground</a>. It has command-line tools to produce all sorts of derivatives, like dot graphs, web components, JSON, you name it, from an <code>.argdown</code> file. Naturally, formatting with Markdown in it is also supported.</p>

<p>That discovery led me to two questions. (1) - what would an <em>existing</em> debate look like in such a system? And (2) - how could we shift the workflow towards using one?</p>

<p>So I picked the most contentious topic in WebGPU discussions and tried to reconstruct it. Topic was about choosing the shading language, and why SPIR-V wasn’t accepted. It was discussed by the W3C group over the course of 2+ years, and it’s evident that there is <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/847#issuecomment-642497578">some</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23089745">misunderstanding</a> of why the decision was made to go with WGSL, taking Google’s Tint proposal as a starting point.</p>

<p>I attempted to reconstruct the debate in https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate, building the <a href="https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate/blob/b28252ea99aef8989858ece09f74dc0758e3d46c/arguments/SPIR-V.argdown">SPIR-V.argdown</a> with the first version of the argumentation graph, solving (1). The repository accepts pull requests that are checked by CI for syntax correctness, inviting everyone to collaborate, solving (2). Moreover, the artifacts are automatically uploaded to Github-pages, rendering the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/webgpu-debate/SPIR-V.component.html">discussion</a> in a way that is easy to explore.</p>

<h2 id="way-forward">Way forward</h2>

<p>I’m excited to have this new way of preserving and growing the structure of a technical debate. We can keep using the code hosting platforms, and arguing on the issues and PR, while solidifying the core points in these <code>.argdown</code> files. I hope to see it applied more widely to the workflows of technical working groups.</p>

			<p><em>“David, this one, tell me about it …”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3.jpg"><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-725x532.jpg 725w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>He’d let me look at his domain name portfolio. Not names he owned and parked, but domains he owned &amp; developed. This was another early project of his – a job board solely focused on the ranching industry. All aspects – cattle, outfitters, dude/guest, hunting, and even associated businesses like horseback riding. He’d launched it in 1998, and done an admirable job developing the brand and building an audience. But other projects had hijacked his attention, and the site had become a bit stale. Its revenue had evaporated.</p>
<p>I knew David from a partnership between DudeRanch.com (mine, at the time) &amp; GuestRanches.com (his). We had grouped them together to sell advertising. A handshake deal. Stronger together, we assumed. And we were right. Over the years, we were able to (more than) double revenue by leveraging the authority of our sites as one entity, versus two.</p>
<p>The more we worked together, the more we shared business opportunities with one another. At one point he shared his portfolio with me, <em>and that’s when I discovered <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RanchWork.com</a></em> .</p>
<p>At that time, I’d been poking around for a second project to develop, and came up empty after a year or so of searching. My usual avenue for acquisition, the <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expiring domain name market</a>, hadn’t yielded anything of value, so my wandering mind lead me to David.</p>
<p>When I uncovered RanchWork, it reminded me of a friend – <a href="http://shanepike.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shane Pike</a> – who’d built, developed, and successfully sold a nursing job board several years before. And from what I remember, he did it solo. The straightforward nature of job boards was attractive – direct, simple, &amp; sans-fluff.</p>
<p>The niche was compelling, so after I slept on it, I pinged David. To see if he’d let me test a project on it. I was already deeply entrenched in the dude ranching industry, so it seemed like a natural extension. The rough idea was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point the RanchWork.com nameservers to me, and I’ll cover the costs of re-development, plus oversight &amp; maintenance.</li>
<li>Once developed, I’d allow <em>free</em> job listings for ranchers to encourage a regular stream of postings. </li>
<li>I’d also allow <em>paid</em> listings (which would post at a faster clip, and remain active for a longer period. </li>
<li>To ensure simplicity, I’d avoid any type of login or account creation. If a rancher was hiring, they’d simply fill out a form, enter credit card info (if needed), and submit. Done deal.</li>
<li>David would receive 25% of all job board revenue the site collected; the remaining 75% would fall into my pocket. Ad publisher revenue was also under my wing.</li>
<li>David would continue to own the domain, 100%, outright.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes it easy (&amp; fun) to work with David is his ‘<em>screw it, let’s do it</em>‘ attitude. I very much admire that about him, as I tend to follow the same outlook on life. And he brought that spirit into this project as well.</p>
<p>So he agreed. And I got to work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1309"><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-464x700.jpg" alt="David McCollough &amp; Peter Askew" width="464" height="700" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-464x700.jpg 464w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1.jpg 477w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1309">David McCollough &amp; Peter Askew (the tall idiot)</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Now, sure, from the outset, I could have viewed this idea from a defeatist attitude, that being, “What? I’m gonna try to compete with Indeed, SimplyHired, Monster, and the like? They’re VC backed heavyweights… I have no chance.”</em></p>
<p>I rarely approach projects from this mindset. I tend to approach them from the perspective, “what do I have to lose”. And usually, the answer is  “not much”. And then that thought morphs into “let’s see what kinda shit I can stir up”.</p>
<p>So to start, I purchased a $60 job board theme, and took a full week to properly architect the site for mobile devices and seo. I researched competitors. $25 seemed like the average rate for paid job postings, so that became my base price. Another close friend, <a href="https://www.workinsports.com/blog.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Clapp</a>, suggested I add a ‘Job Wanted’ listing for folks searching for ranch employment. I was skeptical that need existed, but added it anyway. And then I happily overpaid for the fastest, most reliable WordPress host I could find. </p>
<p>Essentially, the site changed from this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min.jpg" alt="early RanchWork.com website" width="764" height="887" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min.jpg 764w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min-258x300.jpg 258w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min-603x700.jpg 603w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px"></p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1.jpg" alt="RanchWork.com 2014" width="768" height="756" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1.jpg 768w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1-300x295.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1-700x689.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p>
<p>An improvement, I thought. Not perfect, but better. Simpler in a way. </p>
<p>I re-launched the site in October of 2013.</p>
<p>At first, I seeded all the jobs myself. Then ranchers started submitting their own. Then I shifted into curation &amp; verification. </p>
<p>Then, over the next 7 years, site traffic did this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png" alt="" width="700" height="158" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>From virtually zero traffic, the site ramped up to roughly 40k-50k visitors a month. Typically 200,000 pageviews every 30 days. I had to start managing overage fees with my hosting provider.</p>
<p>Jobs of all types started pouring in. </p>
<p>As the sole curator, I made sure they followed the singular track I defined. And overall, they did.</p>
<p>Jobs like this, where you <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/packers-trail-guides-maintenance-crew-needed-at-grand-canyon-az/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to ride a mule to &amp; from your work location</a> at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Or this one, for a <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/mountain-permit-rider-needed-at-wyoming-cattle-ranch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mountain Permit Rider</a>, responsible for all for all aspects of yearling cattle care &amp; management in private ranch pastures and mountain forest grazing allotments near Cody, Wyoming. </p>
<p>Or this Job Wanted from 2017, an <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/position-wanted-ranch-hand-91817/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">individual looking for work in the Cave Creek / Scottsdale, Arizona area</a>.</p>
<p>Job posting pictures were equally as endearing. All user submitted. Pics like this:</p>

<p>And even that one at the beginning of the essay. (<em>nyeh, no need to scroll back up, here it is again</em>).</p>

<p>The more jobs (and job wanted) postings we listed, the more positive feedback we’d receive. That we were a great help for a remote ranch with limited hiring resources. That they were in financial straits, and our Free offering allowed them to hire the right Manager to turn their operation around. <em>And the avenue I was most skeptical about</em> – Job Wanted postings – wound up assisting individuals who craved an escape from the city into life on a working ranch (as well as contributing 30% of our overall revenue). &gt;&gt; <em>gracias, Mr. Clapp</em></p>
<p>The feeling was familiar. It felt like my <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vidalia</a> project. That I was making a positive impact. Satisfying a unique pain point, subtly, as a solo operator.</p>
<p>This project – originally a passing glance – became my mini workhorse. And such a proud production that I wound up buying the whole project from David in 2017. I doubled down in 2019 by investing $10k into a fancier backend and refreshed design. The site deserved that – a proper identity.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/new-rw-700x552-min.png" alt="New RanchWork.com" width="700" height="552" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/new-rw-700x552-min.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/new-rw-700x552-min-300x237.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>I tend to approach online businesses this way. Not intentionally – I just found myself on this path. Find a good domain name; build a product/service; see if it solves a problem &amp; makes people happy; <strong>*and only then*</strong> attempt to make it profitable. Purpose always comes first. As does contentment. Revenue always comes second. Sure, this approach has bitten me in the ass before, but I don’t care. When it’s worked, the results are wondrous. And this project checked those boxes.</p>
<p>And while RanchWork.com isn’t a flashy VC funded endeavor, or even some high flying 6-figure revenue generator, it’s not that I don’t care. The <em>site</em> doesn’t care. Cause it’s too busy. Working. Quietly. </p>
<p>My Twitter friend <a href="https://ian.is/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Nuttall</a> identifies these types of projects aptly; as nice, <em>humble</em> internet businesses. </p>
<p>I like humble internet businesses … </p>
<p>… and I’m quite proud to be this job board’s proprietor.</p>

<h2>post script</h2>
<p>I knew I was in a pickle. </p>
<p>While I owned and operated RanchWork.com, I didn’t own the .com name of this niche industry. That being <em>RanchJobs.com</em>. It was owned by a 3rd party, and undeveloped.</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>So in 2018, I reached out to the owner. I got lucky, in that – – he responded. We had mutual friends, so that helped. The email:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>He was aware of my RanchWork project, and the price point reflected that. And he wouldn’t go lower. I couldn’t wrap my head around the price, so I shelved it. </p>
<p>Until 2020, two years later. When COVID-19 hit. The financial world went sideways. I was a bit frazzled as well. This domain name bubbled up into my brain, though. That this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>So I leveraged a 3rd party domain marketplace platform where I could remain somewhat anonymous. I submitted an offer of $2,500.</p>
<p>They countered at $9,999. </p>
<p>I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>A broker from the marketplace called. Nice guy. He probed like a domain broker should do. He asked if they got down to $5k, if it’d be a range we’d consider. I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>They brought the $5k offer to the table. </p>
<p>I understood I was in a halo of time where this price could disappear as quickly as it appeared, so I went ahead &amp; accepted it.</p>
<p>I wanted that chess piece off the board, essentially. Another barrier to entry. </p>
<p>It’s fun to see how many times this domain is typed into a browser, though (238 times per month, tracked via re-direct). If I look at it from an advertising perspective, &amp; apply a $0.50 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CPC</a> to each visit, this domain should pay for itself by 2023. 🤠</p>
<p>I’m so fortunate the internet exists.</p>

                        <h2 id="you-are-100-responsible-for-everything-i-mean-everything-"><strong>You are 100% responsible for everything. I mean everything.</strong></h2><p>At least that's how you should live your life.</p><p>You're at work, and something happens–a colleague didn't do what they were supposed to one time. Your jerk boss decides last minute to blame you for something that you raised concerns about a month ago. Your spouse is oblivious to what you've been doing around the house and yells at you for not doing the dishes. <em>Again</em>. And yes, I know, you did them all last night.</p><p>But you are responsible.</p><p>I've always struggled with this. It seems unfair, almost unjust. Why should I take responsibility for something that is clearly, utterly, and completely is beyond my control? Why should "they" get away with it? If I take responsibility, aren't I enabling and reinforcing that bad behavior?</p><p>Actually, no.</p><p>The book, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,</em> finally helped me understand. Responsibility and fault ARE NOT the same. It's not your fault that the deadline was missed but you ARE responsible for what you're going to do about it.</p><p>And hell, maybe you do nothing. Maybe that's the best choice. But you are <strong>responsible</strong>.</p><blockquote>See, things happen. Whether it's people, nature, or God, shit happens. This is a universal truth and we cannot escape it. Some of the things that happen are good, some are bad. Some are preventable or in our control. Others aren't. And frankly, none of that matters.</blockquote><p>Things happen and then it's up to you to decide how you want to respond. Responsibility is not about taking the blame, it's about taking control. If you realize that you are responsible, then you can act. And when we act, we can be authors of our own fate. Or at least try.</p><p>Too often we blame others. So much breath is wasted blaming, arguing about who's right, who's wrong, and what "they" should do.</p><p>But you can't control them, you can only control you. So respond. Take action to make whatever outcome you want to happen, happen. Or at least a more likely outcome.</p><p>Take control over your feelings. Yes, those things that try to control us and come out of nowhere.</p><blockquote>Impossible? No. Difficult? Yes.</blockquote><p>Be responsible for how you feel. Be responsible for how you act. Your reaction is up to you. "Re" and "act" meaning, your action that happens in response to a stimulus.</p><p>Because you got angry when someone cut you off does not mean that you have to speed up and flick them off. You will have impulses, and that's fine. But your "re-action" is under your control.</p><p>The blood flowing to your limbic system, reducing your ability to think clear does not make you a monkey. You can still think. You can still breath. Talk yourself off the emotional, reactive ledge, and think.</p><p>That magical tool of cognition that humanity &nbsp;has developed. Thinking. Think about what your reaction is going to be. Be responsible for your action.</p><p>Responsibility is painful. It's shitty, frustrating, and requires extra effort. But as you realize that you're in more control than you think, other things begin to happen as well. You are no longer controlled by others.</p><p>Or at least less so. You may be fired. It might not be your fault. And bitching about it for a month is justifiable. And it would feel oh sooooo good.</p><p>But, your response is your choice. You can respond with bitching, or you can respond with gritting your teeth and looking for new jobs.</p><p>Either way, the choice is yours.</p>

      <h2>All about Modelica</h2>
      <p>
	by <b>Marco Bonvini</b> on Monday June 29, 2020
      </p>
    <p>Early in my career, when ML and AI weren’t as cool, I fell in love with modeling and simulations.
As Joel Spolsky recently <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2020/06/18/hash-a-free-online-platform-for-modeling-the-world/">put it</a>,
sometimes you’re working on something that’s just too complicated to reason about with simple math, you can’t even begin to guess
how the inputs affect the outputs. In such cases, simulation models will help you understand better complex problems.<!--more--></p>

<p>While working with modeling and simulations, I discovered Modelica, a language for developing simulation models.
I worked <a href="https://marcobonvini.com/research">extensively</a> with Modelica, both during my Ph.D. as well as
in my first job at <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Modelica is a great tool for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system">cyber-physical systems</a>,
for example to study the fuel efficiency of an hybrid vehicle, or to evaluate the interactions between renewable energy sources
and the electrical grid.</p>

<p>In this post I will provide a general overview on Modelica, and I’ll showcase some of its main features.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-modelica">What is Modelica?</h4>

<p>Modelica, as the name suggests, is a modeling language.
Which type of models? Mathematical models.
Modelica does not focus on a particular application domain, and gives you the freedom
to model a variety of problems ranging from electro-mechanical systems for automotive
or aerospace applications, to financial models for banks.</p>

<p>You can use the language to create mathematical models using any combination of the
following formalisms</p>

<ul>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>algebraic equations</li>
  <li>difference equations</li>
  <li>discrete event systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, this kind of flexibility makes it easier to tackle lots of
different and interesting engineering problems, including cyber-physical systems.
Typical examples of such systems are cars. Cars are characterized by mechanical components that interact
with electronics and hydraulic systems, all under the supervision of multiple control systems.
So if you want to know how a car is actually going to behave, you need to simulate the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Ignoring the interaction between components – a rookie mistake in the world of simulations –
would lead to a poor understanding of the system.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/hybrid-car-scheme.png" alt="A car, typical example of cyber-physical system.">
   <figcaption>
      A car, typical example of cyber-physical systems.
   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s not hard to find other examples of cyber-phyisical systems, they’re everywhere you look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every private or public transportation vehicle – from airplanes to e-bikes</li>
  <li>the electrical grid that powers our houses</li>
  <li>data centers that process our data, etc.</li>
  <li>our homes, thanks to the increasing adoption of PV panels, batteries, EV cars, and IoT devices</li>
</ul>

<p>So, at this point you should be convinced that cyber-physical systems are a big part of
everyday life. Modelica allows engineers and scientists to model these systems accurately,
giving us a chance to improve their performance. <strong>This is why Modelica matters</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="modeling-the-real-world">Modeling the real world</h4>

<p>Ask any engineer, and they’ll tell you - “It’s tough to model the real world!”
Engineers perform a balancing act when they create models of complex
physical systems, building detailed simulations while at the same time struggling
against overwhelming complexity or irrelevant detail.</p>

<p>The Modelica modeling language has several features that make it the right choice for
modeling complex engineering systems. Modelica is not some abstract academic toy
disregarded by the modern industry.
In fact, in the last few years Modelica has been adopted by some of the world’s biggest
automotive companies – Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Toyota, and VW. These companies
use Modelica to design energy efficient vehicles, improve air conditioning systems.
They Ferrari F1 team uses Modelica too for designing their racing cars!
And the automotive sector is just one of many that find this language effective.
The aerospace and energy industry are increasingly adopting Modelica, and the US Department
of Energy has been steadily investing in this technology for <a href="https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings">modeling buildings</a>
and improving their energy efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="modelica---a-first-example">Modelica - A first example</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica association</a> website,
<em>Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model
complex physical systems including a variety of different aspects, including mechanical,
electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.</em></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the big picture behind any Modelica model</p>

<p><img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/modelica_toolchain.png" width="100%">
</p>


<p>The steps are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an engineer/scientist writes a Modelica model that represents an idea as a series of equations,</li>
  <li>a Modelica tool analyzes the model and verifies its correctness – Does the model have the same number
 of variables and equations? Are there typos?</li>
  <li>the tool compiles the model and generates an executable</li>
  <li>run the executable to simulate the system and produce data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before diving into some of Modelica’s core concepts let’s start with an example,
a kind of <strong>HelloWorld</strong> of differential equations. We’ll use the simplest
differential equation you can imagine</p>

<p>
$$ \frac{d \, x(t)}{dt} = -2 \, x(t) $$
</p>
<p>with initial condition \( x(t_0) = 5 \)</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span> 1 </span><span>model</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>  <span>"The simplest differential equation ever"</span>
<span> 2 </span>  <span>// Define variables and parameters here...</span>

<span> 4 </span>    <span>"The unknown variable"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 5 </span>  <span>constant</span> <span>Real</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2.0</span>
<span> 6 </span>    <span>"Constant that characterizes the model"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 7 </span>  <span>parameter</span> <span>Real</span> <span>x_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span>
<span> 8 </span>    <span>"Initial value of the variable x"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 9 </span><span>initial</span> <span>equation</span>
<span>10 </span>  <span>// Define initial conditions here...</span>
<span>11 </span>  <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>12 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>13 </span>  <span>// Write the equations here...</span>
<span>14 </span>  <span>der</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>15 </span><span>end</span> <span>HelloWorld</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The keyword <code>model</code> defines the beginning of a model named <strong>HelloWorld</strong>.
The model is divided in three sections: declarations, initializations and equations.
The model starts by declaring variables, constants and parameters. <strong>Variables</strong> represent
quantities that are expected to change over time. <strong>Constants</strong>, meanwhile, are fixed
quantities that will never change. And finally <strong>parameters</strong> are quantities
that do not change over time but may change between simulations.
In this case parameter <code>x_start</code>, constant <code>a</code> and variable <code>x</code> have the same type,
<code>Real</code> type meaning a floating point number.</p>

<p>The keywords <code>initial equation</code> introduce the second part of our model.
Here we define the initial conditions of the system, for example the value of <code>x</code> at
the beginning of our model’s simulation time.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>equation</code> introduces the third and final part of our program,
where we finally get down to writing the equations of the system.
In this case there is one variable <code>x</code> and one differential equation <code>der(x) = a*x</code>.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is the <code>der(...)</code> operator that indicates the
time derivative of the expression inside the brackets.
The ability to express derivatives in such a clean and concise way is very helpful
when dealing with mathematical models.</p>

<h3 id="modelicas-key-principles">Modelica’s key principles</h3>

<p>So we’ve completed a simple example to get familiar with Modelica. Now, let’s look at
some of its most interesting features. As I mentioned at the beginning of the post,
Modelica is an object-oriented equation-based modeling language.
What exactly do those words mean? Let’s have a look, keeping in the context of
mathematical modeling.</p>

<h4 id="equation-based-modeling">Equation-based modeling</h4>

<p>Computer programs are nothing but clever set of instructions to let a computer solve a particular
problem for us (If this sounds familiar, bear with me. I’m going to make a distinction between
assignments and equations that you might not be familiar with).
Let’s consider the following problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>.
The following code snippet shows a solution to the problem implemented in C</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>){</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>What happens here when the program is executed is that the value 4 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>a</code>, the value 3 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>b</code> and then their sum is assigned to the memory space associated to variable <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>Given the initial problem, this program implements a particular solution to it. And, most of the
time when we write algorithms we are writing specific solutions to certain problems.
In this case the problem and its algorithmic solution were pretty straightforward!</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: when dealing with mathematical modeling the situation is quite different.
You typically start with a set of equations that describe the general understanding of the system
you want to model.</p>

<p>Then, you can collected data about that system, and feed it into those equations to start
generating some interesting answers to your questions. Often there are  multiple questions to answer,
so the model should be as general as possible so that it can be be easily manipulated to
answer all the questions.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to our problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>. The following
is an example of a Modelica model that solves it</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span>1 </span><span>model</span> <span>Sum</span>
<span>2 </span>   <span>Integer</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>3 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>4 </span>   <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>5 </span>   <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>6 </span>   <span>b</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>7 </span><span>end</span> <span>Sum</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The content of line 4 is the essence of equation-based modeling. It all boils
down to two concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>c - (a + b) = 0</code> is an equation and <strong>equations are not assignment</strong> like the ones we’re used to
 write in C, Java, Python, etc.</li>
  <li><code>a = 4</code> and <code>b - 3 = 0</code> are located on lines 5 and 6. Both lines come after
 the first equation, and because <strong>equations are not assignment, their order does not matter</strong>.
 The only thing that matters is that the model has the same number of variables and equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it turns out that equation-based modeling is all about writing equations with code. The Modelica tool
of choice will know how to symbolically analyze the model, extract equations, substitute variables
in equations, sort them and apply the proper numerical methods to find the solution.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-causality">Working with Causality</h4>

<p>The equation-based paradigm opens the door to an interesting concept called a-causality.</p>

<p>Before focusing on the meaning and implications of a-causality let’s have a look at an example …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
            <p>I'm one of those people surprised at the success of the Go programming language. Here is a language that prides itself in offering less than languages designed decades ago, unabashedly not OOP, and without a decent dependency management system (at least initially), but still wildly successful, with a number of significant open source projects written in it (e.g. Docker, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">Terraform</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>). Another intriguing thing is that people who use Go as their primary language rarely complain about it (maybe a <em>generics would be nice</em> here and there), while those who come into initial contact with it can't stop swearing, at least initially (<em>mea culpa</em>). I used this gap in affinity as a chance to understand the intricacies of Go by diving into the platform, and writing down what I think is necessary knowledge for newcomers to become productive on it. The target reader group would be developers already proficient in one language and platform; as the text is already quite long, I didn't want to explain common programming terminology. Unavoidably, my perspective is skewed by the technologies I'm acquainted with, especially Python, with which I frequently compare Go, but it should be useful for all newcomers, even those without too much programming experience. I hope that those already working in Go can also find a useful tip here and there.</p>

<p>And now to the "Why" in the title. The design of Go is a bit curious, in that it leaves out most features of other popular programming languages, going for simplicity rather than recommending itself with more features. My aim was to make a proper attempt at understanding the context for this choice, by following the path from expectations from a language, to design principles, to language features, and finally to the embodiment of the language in terms of compiler, runtime and tooling. This process is never perfect for any technical product, as there are incidental turns taken at every step, but I think the knowledge of how different aspects of a language came to be the way they are, while depending on each other and the context, is very important and useful. I therefore attempted to start with an overview of the "intellectual" history of Go, connecting following discussions of features to this history.</p>

<p>This first part in what I intend to be a two-part series will concentrate on the Go toolchain, that is, the set of tools for writing, verifying, compiling and maintaning Go applications. As we will see, Go tooling has come a long way, and offers a first-class development environment for writing correct and performant applications. The second installment will deal with the most important features of the language, also in the light of Go design decisions. I would like both parts to stay as up-to-date and relevant as possible, so if you have any comments on improving, do leave a comment, and I will make sure to address it.</p>

<h3 id="whyisgothewayitis">Why is Go the way it is?</h3>

<p>In order to appreciate the design decisions that went into the Go language, it's important to understand where the language designers started from, and what problems they expected their language to solve. As Rob Pike explains in detail in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">this article</a> from 2012, Go was not designed to experiment with PLT concepts. The languages and technologies it intended to replace were those in daily use at Google (C++, Java and Python); Go was designed to solve the problems these platforms presented at Google scale. A rough three-part categorization of the problems Go is intended to address can be done as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Build issues</strong>: The problems that C and C++ model of compilation presents are well-known. As explained in the linked article, compiling a moderately large C++ codebase can lead to gigabytes of IO. Go avoids this and similar issues by making unused imports an error, and replacing header files and includes with an inverted dependency model of compilation. Circular imports are also not allowed. One interesting side effect of this stress on dependency hygiene is that copy-paste is preferred to importing large packages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dependency hygiene trumps code reuse. One example of this in practice is that the (low-level) net package has its own integer-to-decimal conversion routine to avoid depending on the bigger and dependency-heavy formatted I/O package. Another is that the string conversion package strconv has a private implementation of the definition of 'printable' characters rather than pull in the large Unicode character class tables; that strconv honors the Unicode standard is verified by the package's tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Developer ergonomics</strong>: Go is a minimalist language that tries to do away with features of languages used at Google, such as C++, Java and Python, which are not coincidentally also quite popular in the rest of the dev community. In fact, as <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">this candid blog post</a> explains, the initial drive to develop Go came from unpleasant experiences developing concurrent code in C++, and the intention of the standards committee to make the language even more complex. While differentiating itself from popular languages, Go cannot stray too far away from them, as it is intended to be used in production at a company the size of Google. As such, it has to be easy to learn, and familiar to junior developers. This simplicity is at the service of solving modern programming challengs, foremost being concurrency. Concurrency in Go is provided through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">communicating sequential processes (CSP)</a>, the advantage of which is that it is easy to integrate into a procedural language. Another modern feature that now meets a C-like language in Go is garbage collection. Due to the type system and memory allocation features of Go, however, garbage collection is different from the way it works in languages like Java or Python; we will discuss this in the follow-up post.</p>

<p><strong>Google-scale</strong>: The design of Go is optimized for disambiguity and parsability. The underlying reasons are the ease of writing external tools and avoiding discord in large developer teams. As an example, Pike <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_4.">mentions</a> that having languages that are whitespace-sensitive, such as Python, is not an issue in itself, but Python embedded in SWIG declarations turns out to be a huge problem. In order to preclude such nuisances, Go has curly braces and clear formatting rules. Another example is the now famous auto-formatting tool that provides a standard through implementation. This, and similar tools like <code>gofix</code> which we will discuss later, are possible because the language is easy to parse and unambiguous (in comparison to e.g. C++, which can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse">statements that can be parsed multiple ways</a>). These tools enable standards to be set within large groups, and also systematic changes such as API changes to be made on large code bases. Generally, it can also be said that the rest of the design concerns gathered in the previous categories also contribute to scaling Go, especially those concerning concurrency primitives and strong standard library support. Another aspect of scale is the number of people working on a project. As Pike correctly observes, developers tend to stick to a subset they understand of a complex language with many features. As Go has a rather limited set of features, there is no subset to agree on.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all the design choices that went into Go can be explained through these points. There are quite a number of things that are put to good use in other languages, but are explicitly shunned in Go, such as OOP, exceptions and generics. In my opinion, there is one general thread that connects the dots, which is that in Go, things that are a pain in the large are not allowed in the small, either. Or in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_7.">Rob Pike's words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with many of the design decisions in Go, it forces the programmer to think earlier about a larger-scale issue … that if left until later may never be addressed satisfactorily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another important aspect you need to keep in mind when reading Go documentation, and wondering at how <em>basic</em> it is, is that priorities in keeping the implementation simple and feasible in certain areas led the designers to simply omit what one takes for granted in other languages, but leads to hidden complexity in the implementation. As stated in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_doesnt_Go_have_feature_X">official FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go was designed with an eye on felicity of programming, speed of compilation, orthogonality of concepts, and the need to support features such as concurrency and garbage collection. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="thegotoolchain">The Go toolchain</h3>

<p>The core of the Go toolchain is the <code>go</code> command line tool that bundles the most important components, including the compiler. In the rest of this text, Go refers to the language and ecosystem, whereas go (with lowercase g) refers to the command line tool. Go adheres to the recent pattern of delivering development tools where the entry point is one single command which accepts a first argument as an action (other examples could be git and kubectl). In daily work, when building Go code, one rarely has to deal directly with the actual compiler or linker, which are hidden somewhere in the Go distribution. The Go compiler is in fact written in Go itself, and thanks to this fact and the snappy compile times, boostrapping the Go toolchain is one of the simplest ways to get an up-to-date version on your computer. You will first need to get the out-of-date but still useful version of go from system repositories, as in <code>apt install golang</code>. Afterwards, download the latest source package …</p></section></article></div></div>

If so, you're not alone&nbsp;— and there is Canadian science to back you up.</p>  <p>As political and business leaders push to reopen the economy hoping to get restaurants, retailers and factories making money again, there may be good economic reasons for putting at least some of the work-from-home crowd back into the office as fast as it's safe to do so.</p>  <p>Canadian research on "computer-mediated communication," begun long before the current lockdown, shows video chat is an inadequate substitute for real-life interaction. The real thing, dependant&nbsp;on non-verbal cues, is extraordinarily more effective in creating rapport and getting ideas across.</p>  <p>Not only that, but the familiarity and trust we currently feel with coworkers during the lockdown's remote calls rests on connections remembered from back when we sat at a nearby desk or met for lunch.</p>  <h2>Bad for business</h2>  <p>As the lockdown stretches out and the mix of colleagues changes, it may be almost impossible to establish healthy trusting working relationships using remote video chat tools alone.</p>  <p>That's bad for business, said&nbsp;organizational behaviour specialist Mahdi Roghanizad from Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Business. The reason:&nbsp;getting a good reading on your fellow workers has been repeatedly shown to be essential for business efficiency, reaching common goals&nbsp;and establishing trust.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | 'Zoom fatigue' is real and it's setting in:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Many people are feeling drained because of an increase in video conferencing and psychologists have started describing it as “Zoom fatigue.”<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p>  <p>It is why teams <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792" target="_blank">that worked remotely</a></u> even before the pandemic lockdown always met periodically in person. The latest research shows human-to-human bonding is like a kind of intuitive magic.</p>  <p>"Say you are seeing a person for the first time," explained Roghanizad. "After two&nbsp;to five&nbsp;minutes of interaction, you will have a better chance of a more accurate prediction about their cooperativeness or generosity. This is how our brain evolved."</p>  <p>The crucial point is that merely "seeing" the person is not enough.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This ability goes away when the same interaction happens in video-to-video communication as is happening today through Zoom or Google Meet or Skype," explained Roghanizad, who started his career as an electrical engineer and has since used the tools of hard science to investigate the failures of computerized communication.</p>    <p>The scientist's interest began more than decade ago with&nbsp;research quoted in the Harvard Business Review that showed face-to-face communication was <u><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email" target="_blank">34 per cent more effective</a></u> than email in persuading people to donate to a good cause.</p>  <p>To those of us today with loaded electronic in-boxes, the results of that research may not be surprising.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    
                    <p>Secure, easy to use, cheap: Pick three</p><p>I recently installed Ubuntu Wacky Whatever, the latest version, and I’m very excited about it shipping with SSH 8.2, which means that I can finally use hardware USB keys for secure, easy to use authentication.
If securing your devices has been something you’ve wanted to easily do yourself, read on, because it’s finally happening.</p>
<h2>FIDO2</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting security-related developments recently has been the development of <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> and FIDO2, which are basically euphemisms for “nice security stuff”.
In summary, WebAuthn and FIDO2 aim to make it really easy to use security devices with stuff by standardizing the way the two talk to each other, and using better terms than “stuff”.</p>
<p>This is great news for us, because now we can have dirt-cheap USB keys that can be used to secure all our authentication very easily, without requiring any special security knowledge.
All you need to know to be completely immune to phishing, password theft, and a whole host of other ways of losing Bitcoin is to just plug your USB key in, press the little button/type your PIN/enter your fingerprint, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with SSH?
Very little, but<!-- break --> I like rambling, it is known.</p>
<h3>Using FIDO2 with SSH</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/shoulder-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>Deanna had heard of phishing, and was extremely suspicious of the sound of rubber boots.</span></p></div><p>As you may have suspected from the two seemingly unrelated points above, and the dead giveaway title of this section, it would be tremendous if we could use FIDO2 keys to authenticate over SSH, and the OpenSSH developers made it happen.
OpenSSH now supports FIDO (U2F) and FIDO2 for authentication, with FIDO2 with resident keys having a nicer UX.</p>
<p>At a high level, the USB device (FIDO2 devices don’t have to be USB, but they usually will be) will generate a <span data-expounder="secret-key">secret key</span>.
<span data-expounded="secret-key">
The device can then use this secret key to prove that you have the device in your possession, without the key ever leaving the device.
That means that, by extension, you can use the device to prove you are who you say you are to any server who asks.
</span>
The key is either stored on the device (called “resident key”), which requires the device to support storage, or it isn’t, and <span data-expounder="storage">you need to store the data somewhere else</span>.</p>
<p><span data-expounded="storage">
The way this works, in my understanding (which I’m not certain about and please correct me if I’m wrong), is the following:
Each device comes from the factory with one key pair/seed built in, but it can accept an additional seed to derive more pairs from, by combining its current seed with the one given.
This allows devices to generate keys without having any storage space, but it does require you to be giving them the seed every time.
Devices with “resident key” capabilities can store the whole seed on their memory, and don’t need you to do anything else.
</span></p>
<p>The benefit of using a device like this including eliminating phishing, password theft, authentication replay, and lots of other attacks.
Since the device authenticates to a specfic realm (server address/URL/etc), an attacker can’t reuse one site’s authentication on another site, which makes phishing impossible.
Nobody can steal your password or private key either, since it’s on the device itself and extracting it is impossible.
The only plausible attack is physical theft with the device, which is mitigated by making the device ask for a PIN or fingerprint and wiping itself after a few wrong attempts.</p>
<p>Another benefit with having this built into SSH is that you don’t specifically need a Yubikey, or to mess with extra software like Yubikey agent, PIV mode or anything else.
You just plug any FIDO2-compatible key in, and you can use it with SSH.
I tried the following on both my Yubikey 5C, Yubikey FIDO2 and Yubikey NEO, they worked like a charm on all of them, but “resident key” mode only works on the 5C and later versions of the FIDO2 key.</p>
<h2>Actual usage</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/padlocks-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>With twelve padlocks, the city of Indianapolis was sure it had put a stop to miscreants stealing its favorite fence.</span></p></div><p>After all the needless detail about how devices work, we’re ready to actually use one for SSH.
Setting that up is really simple, basically one or two commands (depending on the method) with no extra software to install, though you will need to be running OpenSSH 8.2 on both client and server.</p>
<p>I will split the instructions into two parts, one for if your key supports (and you want to use) the resident key mode, and one for if it doesn’t.
There’s no harm in using either method, so if you don’t know if your device supports resident key mode, just try the first method and continue to the second one if it fails.</p>
<h3>Resident key mode</h3>
<p>Use the following command to generate a key and store it on the device:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You only really need the latter, it’s your public key, and you can now add it to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file of any server that runs OpenSSH 8.2 and above.</p>
<p>To add your private key to the SSH agent, you can either copy <code>id_mykey_sk</code> to your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory, or (if you’re at a new computer and don’t have the key with you), run</p>

<p>with your device plugged in.
This will add the key to the SSH agent, and you will be able to connect to servers immediately.</p>
<h3>Non-resident key mode</h3>
<p>The non-resident key mode is the same as the previous mode, except you can’t load your key with <code>ssh-add -K</code> directly from the device.
As before, run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You need both of these files, store <code>id_mykey_sk</code> in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory (where it got generated) and add the <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code> file to any server you want to log in to.</p>
<p>That’s it, when you try to log in, OpenSSH will ask you for your PIN and to touch the device.</p>
<h2>Security considerations</h2>
<p>You can pass the <code>no-touch-required</code> option to <code>ssh-keygen</code> to tell it that you don’t want it to require touching the device every time, but I haven’t had great results with enabling that.
If you try it, let me know how well it works in the comments, but it’s probably better for security if you leave it disabled.</p>
<p>Storing your key on the device means that nobody will be able to steal it (hopefully your device has a PIN or other authentication method set), but untrusted computers might still be able to send commands over the SSH session after you connect.
Don’t SSH from computers you don’t trust, and be extra careful when using SSH forwarding (the <code>-A</code> option), as the server can then ask your computer to authenticate to other servers on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I’m very excited about FIDO2 in general, and for SSH authentication specifically, because we finally have a way to secure authentication that my parents can easily use, with a much smaller attack surface.
I’m particularly interested in seeing how WebAuthn takes off for authenticating on the web without usernames and passwords (see my <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/django-webauthin">django-webauthin</a> library for a demo), and hope it becomes widespread.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="banner"> <div> <div> <div>  <h4>29 Jun 2020</h4> <p> <i></i> Reading time ~14 minutes </p><!-- /.entry-reading-time --> </div> <p>In 2005, the .NET Framework had its 1.1 SP1 release and was relatively stable. Visual Studio .NET 2003 was a solid release. C# was being widely adopted throughout the industry. Selecting it for a project cost me my job, and nearly sunk my career as a software developer.</p> <!--more-->  <p>This was almost two decades ago, so I feel comfortable discussing it now. I was working as a software developer at Hewlett-Packard in Nashua, New Hampshire, USA. HP had recently merged with Compaq, and absorbed the office buildings and personnel that were once Compaq, and Digital Equipment Corp. before that. Our project was called ActiveAnswers, a Content Management System (CMS) that existed before the term was coined.</p> <p>When I joined Compaq in 2000, ActiveAnswers was a set of HTML templates and text files that were converted into a massive static web site every night. During the day, content editors would make changes by editing the text files. The site used dozens of Perl scripts to combine the content from the text files with the HTML templates.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, my team of five people had completely rewritten the application into a mostly WYSIWYG UI that permitted our content editors to make changes directly in a web browser, seeing the results almost immediately. All of the content was stored in a SQL Server database. The front end code was written in VB 6, and was starting to feel a little overweight.</p> <p>We had adopted many of the practices of the newly-released eXtreme Programming methodology. The project had automated unit tests and daily (if not continuous) builds. We even built a pair-programming lab. I wish I still had pictures, because doing that in 1999 was a sight to behold. We had taken over a former QA lab. It was about 16 x 24 feet, with windows on the long walls, and it had a locking door. We set up stations around the perimeter of the room, each consisting of a laptop docking station, a 21” monitor, keyboard, mouse, and two chairs. Each station had plenty of room for two without crowding the adjacent station. In the center of the room was a conference table with room for all of us.</p>  <p>Not long after, Hewlett-Packard decided that they needed to be bigger than Dell. So instead of competing with Dell head-to-head, they decided to get bigger the new-fashioned way: they bought another company. The new company was indeed larger than Dell – for about six months.</p> <p>As soon as the deal closed, the new HP (NYSE: HPQ) was the #1 computer maker in the world. Within six months, however, Dell had regained its #1 position and dropped HP to a solid #2. HP was suddenly in trouble, being dragged down by a bloated Compaq organization. That was their story, at least.</p> <p>It was time to cut away some of the bloat. HP announced a 10% “reduction in workforce.” I suppose they call it that because it sounds better than a “lay off.” It also sounds better than “you’re fired!”</p> <p>Amazingly, most of the people with whom I worked did not seem to care. In fact, many were excited by the prospect of getting a great “layoff package.” In case you are not familiar with these, a layoff package is money given to the suddenly out-of-a-job employee. In my case, only having been an employee for two years, I was only eligible for six weeks of pay.</p>  <p>After the merger, the team and project experienced some significant growing pains. Executives at HP had seen ActiveAnswers and wanted to expand its reach. They wanted to ensure the team could handle the additional workload.</p> <p>All of the contractors on the team were made a similar offer: accept a full-time job with HP at a reduced pay rate, or be replaced. A few of us chose to remain. One colleague in particular, who was instrumental in designing and building the application’s UI, chose to leave. He was unceremoniously replaced with two junior contractors who combined were far less effective than he had been. Although we had more work to do, morale was low for those who remained.</p>  <p>Over the next few years, our team of five grew to 20. Four times the size does not equate to four times the productivity. In many ways, we seemed to be much less effective. We struggled to keep up with the ever-expanding business requirements. Feature after feature was requested. New users and new content were added, putting a strain on an architecture that had been built for fewer than a dozen users. Training demands increased. The venerable VB6 was showing its age. It was time for something new.</p> <p>The company provided all of its developers with an MSDN Subscription, and a few us were excited by the release of Visual Studio 2003. Windows XP was still fresh, and the two seemed to work flawlessly together. We decided to start experimenting with .NET and C# to see whether we could provide the users with the features and the performance they needed.</p>  <p>At first, the idea of switching to a newer technology was met with mild curiosity. The leadership authorized a proof of concept. “Go do something and then show the rest of the team.”</p> <p>We decided to hire a contractor with proven experience in .NET, though the fact that it was only a couple of years old made this difficult. We found a local consultant who had been using it since its introduction.</p> <p>One of the tasks we assigned to him was to review our new .NET code and let us know where and how it could be improved.</p> <h2 id="trycatch-as-flow-control">Try/Catch as Flow Control</h2> <p>One of the first things he uncovered was large blocks of nested try/catch statements used to implement complex flow control. One instance he found was a single function with six or seven nested try/catch blocks. When asked about it, the developer who had implemented the function said he had heard that if/then was inefficient, so he used try/catch instead. No amount of persuasion could convince him that he had it backwards.</p> <h2 id="for-every-rule-there-is-an-exception">For Every Rule There is an Exception</h2> <p>Speaking of try/catch, every time an exception was caught, it was swallowed, and a new exception was thrown in its place. The pattern in .NET is to catch only those exceptions you can handle. The rest should bubble up naturally to higher levels of your application. It is acceptable to catch and rethrow, but there are only a few specific ways to do that. Throwing a brand new exception is not usually one of them. Trying to explain that to the other developers resulted in repeated explanations that it was the consultant who did not understand. My favorite line from those meetings was, “Let me say it again so you’ll understand.”</p> <h2 id="isup">IsUp</h2> <p>One of the improvements that had been made was the implementation of a set of web services. Our consultant discovered that every web service call was preceded by a separate call to an endpoint called “IsUp” to ensure the web server was listening, before making the actual call.</p> <p>In 2005, bandwidth was not quite what it is in 2020, and each call was relatively expensive. Not only was this wasteful, it also did not accomplish its goal. On more than one occasion, IsUp would return true, and the next call would fail anyway due to the service being down.</p> <p>Upon learning about this revelation, our management decided it would probably not hurt anything to leave it in place.</p> <h2 id="everyone-into-the-pool">Everyone Into the Pool</h2> <p>One of the benefits .NET offered was robust database connection pooling. The pattern Microsoft suggested was to create an ADO.NET connection object every time you needed one, and release it immediately when you have finished using it. The system would maintain a pool of connections behind the scenes for you.</p> <p>Rather than using ADO.NET, however, one of our contractors decided that it would make more sense to roll his own connection pooling system. When our new consultant pointed this out, he was accused of not understanding the subtle advantages our own pooling system had over Microsoft’s.</p>  <p>After a few weeks of this, our new consultant was beyond frustrated. We sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk. He felt he was adding no value to the project or the team. His suggestions were ignored or belittled. In fact, my manager essentially told him that his services were no longer required, and that his contract would not be renewed. I asked him whether he would stick around until it ended. His reply was amusing. He said that although he could stay and continue to “turn the money crank,” he felt that doing so would compromise his professional integrity. Six weeks after he started, our consultant left.</p>  <p>Right about the time our .NET consultant left, the word came down from management that our .NET experiment was a failure, and that we were to go back to VB 6 for all new code.</p> <p>A few short weeks later, we were having a particularly difficult problem with one of our application components. VB simply did not have the language facilities to deal with this particular issue without massive brute-force coding. C#, on the other hand, had a very straightforward way to solve the problem.</p> <p>I finally made the decision to implement that particular component in C#. My plan was to show management that .NET was still a viable option for our project, and this small enhancement would be the proof. The solution was everything I had hoped it would be: short, elegant, and easy to understand.</p> <p>At this point in the story, I wish I still had the source code that I could share. However, <a href="https://walkingriver.com/perjury">I learned the hard way not to keep source code when leaving a company</a>.</p>  <p>We had a policy on our team that each new feature would be revealed on a team-wide NetMeeting conference, attended by anyone interested. The primary developer on the feature would explain it, show the passing unit tests, demonstrate the feature, and then answer questions from the rest of the team. We had these meetings a few times per week, as I recall.</p> <p>This call was my time to shine, or so I imagined. I went through all of the normal steps, and all was going well.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>What is your story? How did you start writing your blog? Was it something that you decided to try since the start of covid? Over the months I’ve started to post some of the learning and technology I’ve came across at work. Over the months of writing, I found myself gaining so much more than what I started out to do. Everything starts with a single step. Before we take our first step, we often have a vision of how that finishing line may look like. We may also have some perspective of how the journey itself may look like. What do you know? As you take a step forward, and then another. You decide to take a pause and look back. You find your perspective of the world has changed just so much!</p>

<p>Today, I will be talking about two key parts of my journey:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>How did this whole venture start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone starts their journey with a goal in mind. Simple and straight forward objectives to achieve! (:</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond the initial objectives, I found myself learning just so much as I share my learnings online. Not only does it help me to understand different topics better, it actually help me to change my perspective towards problems and better position me for my growth as a software engineer.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h2>#1. How did this whole venture start?</h2>

<p>It started with just 3 simply purposes:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Being more detail oriented</li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to delve deeper into each of the topics and technology i am learning at work. So much to cover, but never really understanding each of it. The last thing you want to do is to get the job done without properly learning the best practices and finding that growth in you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a pause, and look a little closer</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hone my technical skills</li>
</ol>

<p>This platform was intended for me to explore the different web development tools and understand the nuts and bolts behind the delivery of a good website. You are worth the value you give. And if you want to create value for people, you got to put in the work to hone that technical skill and deliver that tip top quality work</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no free meals in the world, if you want to create value, you got to earn the craft</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve on my writing</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve always been a thrash writer. I even started out writing my posts in point forms as I was never able to articulate my thoughts coherently. But I realized the ability to articulate your point in a succinct and concise form is an art that needs to be developed. Over the months and numerous articles, I’ve started to learn how to put my thoughts into words and organize my thoughts for a meaningful sharing.</p>

<p>Here’s a reference to my first blog post to understand the drastic difference haha! <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-01-26-first-post-of-2020/">Joshua’s first post back in January 2020</a></p>

<p>What i’ve gotten from this pet project didn’t just stop here. Rather, I have taken away so much more than what i intended to learn from the start. As i reflect back, I realized i’ve learnt way more than what I’ve intended to when i first start out. I believe many readers can resonate with that as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</h2>

<p>I’ve learnt so many lessons from my writing adventure thus far! In this list, we will go through the top 5 of them. Do leave a comment below if you can resonate with any of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Community is king</h3>

<p>To consistently be able to gather feedback on whatever you’ve written helps to create some discussions via the net. Especially if you know you’re touching an interesting topic that people has been talking about.</p>

<p>It is never to find the most glamorous topics to talk about just so you can be ‘part of the gang’. That sounds more like a FOMO to me. Don’t be a FOMO.</p>

<p>Find out because you genuinely want to learn. There isn’t time to be someone else, chasing other people’s attention.</p>

<p>In the space of technology, there has been so many topics and conversations about open-source. What is open-source?</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source&nbsp;software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which&nbsp;source&nbsp;code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any&nbsp;purpose. - wiki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open-source have its benefits that interestingly seems to contrary to common business thinking.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to start my own solution, and I have to open source it for the world to see and replicate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open sources have many benefits, of the many, i’ll list out a few:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ability to start small</li>
<li>Solid information security</li>
<li>Attract better talent</li>
<li>The power of crowd</li>
<li>better security</li>
<li>Faster to market</li>
</ul>

<p>References for open source advantages:</p>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/top-advantages-open-source-offers-over-proprietary-solutions">top advantages for open-source</a></li>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/enterprise-open-source-advantages">enterprise open source advantages</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2. Writing leaves a story to be told a thousand times</h3>

<p>It sounds no-brainer but as I was part of the process, i came to see how informative articles allows you share your understanding of a topic multiple times without having to repeat yourself. Have you encountered situations where you have shared your story with your group of friends, and suddenly another friend of yours joined the conversation and realized he has missed out on the entire story, asking you to repeat again. But the efforts to repeat seems futile and you don’t seem to be able to recall the story as well as the<br>
first time around? Frustrating and hair-pulling</p>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/955a6f2e7099ef24a2da8aba67b0bb8b/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>This is the situation writing helps to avoid. Write once, and the story lives on. Even for yourself. Sometimes we need a little self reminder of our own learning and sharing.</p>

<p>Even in the technology space, you find the need to do documentation. Technical documentation&nbsp;helps an intended audience&nbsp;use&nbsp;your product, understand your processes, and get unstuck. This audience can be end-users, administrators, colleagues or technicians. Whoever they are, documentation is intended to be clear, searchable and helpful for these people to understand and use your product or services as its intended for. A feature that is hidden and not shared with the audience is no feature at all (Unless it is intended to be hidden away of course).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing solidifies the conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>3. Train of thought is coming through</h3>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/d977e88507428b258d89e27202450058/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tackling a new topic can be overwhelming when you first start out. You will find yourself bombarded with a ton of new technological terms. There is need for you to organize your thoughts, make sense and piece them together like a puzzle.</p>

<p>Have you done a jigsaw puzzle before? You don’t just tackle the pieces in the middle outta no where. You tackle the easiest parts, the sides. You try to find the ‘starting’ point of the information you are reading about, and that usually starts with a <strong>“what”</strong> question. “What is Cache?”, “what is WebRTC”.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you dealing with? Find out with the <strong>“what”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a good understanding of the tool you are learning about - which is the ‘what’ question. The next thing you want to learn is “how”.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does cache work? - it generally works by storing in data in a fast access hardware such as RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an article about how does cache work by <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching/#:~:text=How%20does%20Caching%20work%3F,the%20underlying%20slower%20storage%20layer.">Amazon</a></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does WebRTC work? You can understand that by reading articles. One of which is written by me! Really bite size with good youtube video to solidify the learning. <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">How to make video call application</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a car work? How does a tool work? Find out the mechanics of the tool using the <strong>“how”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People usually just stop here. In technology, often times, by this point you are already swam with a ton of new terminologies and mental models that you can no longer follow the documentation. You will also start to feel your body heating up and a little uncomfortable sweating in your seat. (Speaking from experience from Singapore)</p>

<p>The next question you should strive to ask before you properly take a break is the <strong>“when”</strong> question. When do we use this tool?</p>

<p>When do we use cache? You use this tool when you have frequent database access, or high read requests such as a news article site. Fetch once, store at the front of the store, so people can accessible access it when information is requested.</p>
<br>
<div><p>When do we use WebRTC? When you want to utilize browser’s technology for media exchange which includes video and audio call use cases.</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out when you will need to use a tool? Ask the <strong>“when do you…”</strong> question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this point you have probably figured out these 3 questions “What”, “How”, “When”, have 2 remaining buddies - “Who”, “Where”.</p>

<p>Given the examples and the train of thought, give it a try on the <strong>who</strong> and <strong>where</strong> questions! The end goal is to find the purpose of the tool, and when to use it. Following a simple guideline as such can aid you as you navigate around challenging or foreign technology that crosses your path.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Finding your own voice</h3>

<p>I have to admit my writing was pretty thrashy when i first started out. I was writing posts in point form because i wasn’t able to find the coherence needed to put my thoughts into words. Over the months, this ability starts to develop, and i find myself to be able to express different technical ideas as I understand them to be. I managed to find the words to string together to form the idea and flow I wish to convey to my readers.</p>

<p>Beyond the writing style, writing my articles has always been about sharing knowledge. Knowledge is one asset that is given to another and there are collectively more knowledge in the pool. It has always been sharing knowledge in ways that are comprehensive, bite size and relevant to the intended audience of your posts. I enjoy and find myself learning a ton more when I am required to present these information to the public. I wouldn’t want to mess up presenting inaccurate information. That would make me a fake new spreader. And that is the last thing I ever want to do.</p>

<p>All in all, such an initiative helps me to find the voice that feels “the most me”.</p>

<br>
<h3>5. Share because you never know who could learn from you</h3>

<p>You never know who might find your information useful! If it is organized and coherent, you will find that your knowledge could be the very information that someone else in the world is googling and trying to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>You probably heard of Vim, the almighty text-editor that is everywhere and
a place where <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">people get trapped from time to time</a>.
If you are hearing from your local DevOps engineer how Vim is excellent and
fast, you probably thought about giving it a try. But how did it come
to this? How did Vim-craze take over the world at some point?</p>
<p>If we look at the
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments">StackOverflow survey for 2019</a>
about the most popular development environments, Vim is still there on the 5th
place, with around 25% of Web Developers using it. Fifth place is pretty neat
considering the first Vim release happened almost 30 years ago (yeah, you read
that right, Vim got first released in 1991).</p>
<p>To better understand why and how Vim got (and is) so popular, it is best to
look into the roots of how it all started. Before <code>vim</code>, there was <code>vi</code>, before
<code>vi</code> there was <code>ed</code>. What are all these two or three letter words, and
what is the story behind it? Let us dive in and figure out.</p>
<h2 id="punch-cards-and-line-editors"><a href="#punch-cards-and-line-editors" aria-label="punch cards and line editors permalink"></a>Punch cards and line editors</h2>
<p>It might be apparent today why we have text editors and fully-fledged IDE
(Integrated Development Environment), but what did we have before that?
As you may know, early forms of programming involved putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">papers with
holes (punch cards)</a> inside a
computer. The order in which you placed these in was very essential. For example, this
is a picture of 4.5 megabytes data, stacked in 62500 punch cards. Imagine
dropping that and having to sort it again.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Punch card stack" title="Punch card stack" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/ad5b0a6e4d363f9e5c40fbdcdbe559fb/e6523/punch-card-stack.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/ad5b0a6e4d363f9e5c40fbdcdbe559fb/a80bd/punch-card-stack.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>
  OK, mom, I'll come down, just need to re-stack my new blog post
</p>
<p>Punch cards proved a bit inefficient as computer power and storage grew, and
programming evolved. Eventually, people moved away from punch cards, and then
there came the era of “line editors.” One great example of this is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)"><code>ed</code> editor</a>. Let’s not forget to
mention <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qedman.html">QED editor</a>,
<code>ed</code>’s predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-line-editor"><a href="#using-a-line-editor" aria-label="using a line editor permalink"></a>Using a line editor</h2>
<p>If you are on Linux or Mac OS, open your terminal and type <code>ed</code>. You
will get a simple line editor, which will greet you with silence.
If you are amazed by this finding (as I was), you can try playing with it for a while. To write
a file, start typing <code>a</code> and press enter, then write your text. Typing <code>.</code>
following an enter will exit the append (insert) mode. Then, to write a file, you can
type <code>w myfile.txt</code> and press enter and lastly write <code>q</code> and enter to exit.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># ed
a
Hey there!
I am using ed right now, how cool.
OK, that's enough.
.
w myfile.txt
64
q</code></pre></div>
<p>As you may notice, there are similarities between working with <code>ed</code> and with
today’s <code>vim</code>. If you use Vim, you can say you would get the hang of <code>ed</code> pretty
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="vims-dad---the-vi"><a href="#vims-dad---the-vi" aria-label="vims dad   the vi permalink"></a>Vim’s dad - The Vi</h2>
<p>After <code>ed</code>, then came the <code>em</code> - <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gc/history/">the “editor for mortals”</a>.
It could do similar things as <code>ed</code>, but it is ‘less cryptic’ and built for
regular people. Based on <code>em</code>’s code, Bill Joy developed <code>ex</code>, which
stands for “extended ed”! It was significant because <code>ex</code> had, besides the previous
modes, the <code>visual</code> mode, which will show the whole file on your screen. You
must be thinking - duh, how didn’t they <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">think of that earlier</a>?
Having that thing show up on computers in those days was pretty tricky,
and some considered it a resource hog. But, at that point, the benefits had
outweighed objections, and having a file opened on your screen as you edit it
became today’s standard.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Vi editor" title="Vi editor" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/fcda8/vi.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/12f09/vi.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>And like that, the <strong>vi</strong>sual mode was born. Later, the executable <code>vi</code> got
introduced in operating systems, but you can still access <code>ex</code> commands by
typing <code>:</code> in <code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>. The <code>ex</code> got released in 1976, and the <code>vi</code>
executable got released in 1979. 40-something years ago! But, how did <code>vim</code> came to life?</p>
<h2 id="the-imitation-game"><a href="#the-imitation-game" aria-label="the imitation game permalink"></a>The Imitation Game</h2>
<p>A couple of years later, many <code>vi</code> clones emerged (my favorite one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)">Elvis</a>). One of them was “Vi
Improved” which was created by Bram Moolenaar - the name you now see when you
try to open <code>vim</code> in your terminal. In the large pool of different <code>vi</code> clones,
<code>vim</code> managed to stand out. Bram used a clone of <code>vi</code> called <code>STEVIE</code> (nice
name, BTW), and noticed that it lacks many of <code>vi</code>’s commands. He added
some new features and made it compatible with <code>vi</code> and released it under
the name “Vi Imitation” (this later changed to “Vi Improved”). The name <code>vim</code> came in version 2.0 in 1993 and
stayed like that until the present day. But how did <code>vim</code> achieve fame? It had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Features_and_improvements_over_vi">bunch of excellent features</a>
at that time, and it was compatible with <code>vi</code>. Features and compatibility attracted a lot of folks to use it.</p>
<h2 id="half-a-century-of-contributions"><a href="#half-a-century-of-contributions" aria-label="half a century of contributions permalink"></a>Half a century of contributions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the essential commands to move around in Vim: <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
<code>k</code>, and <code>l</code>, these all pull roots from the old <code>vi</code> days. Bill Joy’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">keyboard at that time</a>
didn’t have cursors to move around. Also, the <code>ESC</code> key was in the place
of today’s <code>TAB</code> key. Take a look at how it was back in the day:</p>

<p>Commands to replace text like <code>:%s/text_to_replace/text_to_replace_it_with/</code> is
also something from that era. Having to type <code>:</code> to perform a command
was an answer to <code>ed</code>’s complete silence when you first enter the editor.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say that <code>vim</code> is an effort of over half a century of
good idea accumulation, putting lots of effort into being backward compatible.
Yes, useful features probably made Vim famous. But what kept Vim in the loop is
the compatibility with almost everything you can think about. Wherever you SSH
today, you can start the Vim session, or at least Vi session. That is a strong
(if not the strongest) point to learn it nowadays.</p>
<p>If you’re not someone who jumps from server to server and navigates files on
there, the point of having Vim everywhere doesn’t bother you. But
still, there are a couple of reasons why it might be valuable to you. I am forming
a new blog post explaining why you should learn Vim in 2020. If you are interested
in this, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" aria-label="final thoughts permalink"></a>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. I hope this blog post shed some
light on how Vim became what it is today. I also hope the post inspired you to
try it out. You never know when you might need it, or you like it so much that
you decide to switch to using Vim fully.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a Vim mode inside your IDE or VSCode, who knows. I am not saying
that Vim should replace what you are using now, but trying to learn and
configure it will improve your skills and abilities. On the other hand, it doesn’t really
matter what editor you use, it is what you do with it!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s the matter of finding the proper editor
(tool) that makes you do what you do even better.</p>

        <p>Imagine this: You have a large multi-module ClojureScript project, and you are planning to make a new deployment in the
production.
Your project is using CLJS Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode.
Everything seems to be working smoothly. You are performing some last E2E tests before making a release.<br>
Then, a faulty module loads.<br>
<strong>BAM!</strong> You are slapped in the face with an error something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
(index):143 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'j' of undefined
    at NU ((index):143)
    at login-a5a67c0fffdfa158b7220c8c2553253b645e4e2e.js:169
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You did not expect this. There were no significant new changes since the last build, and the unit tests were all
hunky-dory.<br>
Additionally, everything worked fine when using Firefox, but now the compiled code crashes on Google Chrome. 
What is going on? The release deadline is looming and you have to fix this ASAP.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.solita.fi/img/taming-cljs-advanced-compilation/slap.png" alt="Holy Stack Trace, Batman!"><br>
<em>Holy Stack Trace, Batman!</em></p>

<p>When you build your code with the CLJS compiler, it emits JavaScript code that is compatible with the 
advanced_optimizations level of the Google Closure compiler. Then, if <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> compiler option is
enabled, the CLJS compiler will minify the result with Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations.</p>

<p>Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode can cause some errors in your build that can be uncomfortable to
track down if you are new to Closure Compiler.
On top of that, help might be hard to find if you are trying to search the web with the error message because the function
names are all mangled up.</p>

<p>It is better to avoid these errors by keeping the Advanced Compilation mode in mind from the start of the project. 
I’ll describe some common methods to help you to avoid and resolve advanced compilation issues, and 
show how to resolve the more uncommon issue that was described in the beginning and what is the reason behind it.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-issues-with-advanced-compilation">Avoiding issues with Advanced Compilation</h2>

<p>It is recommended to use <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> CLJS compiler option for your production builds.
You will greatly reduce your final build size by using more aggressive advanced transformations such as dead code 
removal and aggressive renaming.<br>
Read more about the advanced transformations at here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels#advanced_optimizations">Closure Compiler compilation levels</a></p>

<p>Different build tools such as lein-cljsbuild and shadow-cljs might pass different default options to Closure Compiler.
I won’t cover the differences in this blog post, but instead, I will provide some general guidelines on how to avoid
issues with advanced compilation in your project.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-externs-in-a-good-shape">Keep your externs in a good shape</h3>
<p><a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/externs">Extern</a> is a mechanism for declaring names that should not be munged (renamed) by Closure Compiler.
When you are using external libraries, make sure that they come <a href="http://cljsjs.github.io/">bundled</a>
with externs if you are using a build tool like lein-cljsbuild. Or, provide externs files of your own if needed. 
Otherwise, Closure Compiler will munge references to externally defined symbols unintentionally during advanced 
compilation causing errors found only later when running the compiled code.</p>

<p>To add externs of your own, use a compiler option for example: <code>":externs ["externs.js"]"</code> and provide an
externs.js file in your working directory.</p>

<p>Also, It is good to use <code>":infer-externs true"</code> compiler option. This option will enable generating externs automatically
for JavaScript interop calls.</p>

<p>It is worth to know, that Closure Compiler includes externs for stable JavaScript APIs, but newer features that have an
experimental status might not be included yet. The experimental APIs change very quickly, so it makes no sense to include
them in the Closure Compiler tool. So, if you are planning to use some experimental features, make sure 
you add them to your own externs file.</p>

<p>Read more about using external JavaScript libraries from <a href="http://lukevanderhart.com/2011/09/30/using-javascript-and-clojurescript.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="splitting-code-might-cause-name-collisions">Splitting code might cause name collisions</h3>
<p>If you are <a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/code-splitting">splitting</a> your CLJS code into <code>:modules</code>, you might want
to use <code>:rename-prefix "..."</code> compiler option.<br>
Split modules are running in the global JavaScript scope, so they might interfere with other code loaded on the same page 
(e.g. Google Analytics) and cause unpredictable errors if name collisions occur.
When using <code>":rename-prefix"</code>, it is best to use a very short string as a prefix, for example: <code>:rename-prefix "r_"</code></p>

<p>This will increase the final (gzipped) build size slightly because now each munged global variable will be prefixed with “r_”.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-cljs-output-to-prevent-global-scope-pollution">Wrap CLJS output to prevent global scope pollution</h3>
<p>Closure Compiler will generate a lot of global variables during advanced compilation that can cause name collisions
with other code running on the same page.
If you are loading other code on the same page, and you are not splitting code into multiple modules you can utilize
 the <code>":output-wrapper true"</code> compiler option. The compiler will wrap the outputted JavaScript code with the default 
<code>"(function(){…​};)()"</code>. This will prevent polluting the global JavaScript scope and thus will prevent conflicts
with other external code.</p>

<p>However, if you have multiple modules in your project you must add a compiler option <code>:rename-prefix-namespace "..."</code>.
This enables each module to access the variables defined in the other modules it depends on.
This works similarly to the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option. The difference is that every global variable will be now
scoped under one global variable instead of many. For example, if you use a prefix-namespace like this:
<code>:rename-prefix-namespace "P"</code>, the compiled code will refer to variable <code>"foo"</code> like <code>"p.foo"</code>. 
This option will also increase the final build size like the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option, so think before using it.</p>

<p>There are other interesting compiler options not directly related to advanced optimizations, such as <code>":fn-invoke-direct"</code> 
which can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code. You can read more about them in CLJS 
<a href="https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-advanced-compilation-bugs">Debugging Advanced Compilation bugs</h2>

<p>If you suspect you might have a problem with advanced compilation, often hinted by errors in the browser 
console that might make no sense, it is best to approach the problem in the following way.</p>

<p>Add two additional compiler options <code>":pseudo-names true"</code> and <code>":pretty-print true"</code> for your Advanced Compilation build.
Your error will now show a readable name that corresponds to the name in the source code. 
This will help you to deduce if an extern definition is missing.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your error goes away after enabling the above-mentioned compiler options, it gives you a hint
of a possible name collision problem. When there is a problem with a munged variable name colliding with an external 
variable name, the problem disappears when the munged variable name changes, like what happens when enabling the :pseudo-names option.<br>
Often, if not fixed properly, the name collision issues can arise and then be magically “fixed” when one adds new 
changes, which in turn causes changes in munged variable names in the build output. It is best to eliminate these problems for good.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-something-funky-can-happen">Sometimes, something funky can happen</h3>
<p>In some rare cases, there might be some advanced compilation issues that are not so easy to avoid.
Let’s go back to the beginning. 
We had an error when running our built web app in Chrome. Firefox had no issues.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined 
                for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Stack Trace was pointing to a certain multimethod in the CLJS source code. 
At the first glance, the error might make no sense. The compiled code is trying to invoke -add-method IMultiFn protocol method 
for a function named XR. When searching for the munged <code>XR</code> in the build output, everything seems to be fine.
<code>XR</code> looks good and should work, right?
The key thing to notice in the error message is the <code>"[native code]"</code> part of <code>"function XR() { [native code] }"</code>.
This tells us, that the compiled code is trying to invoke a native browser function <code>XR</code> instead of our munged <code>XR</code>. 
By chance, the Closure Compiler named our multimethod to <code>XR</code> which happens to collide with the browser provided
<code>XR</code> function.</p>

<p>Occasionally you can encounter errors like this when using an older version of Closure Compiler.
Developers add new features to web browsers all the time. When a user upgrades his/her web browser there is a chance 
a new reserved word was added that collides with a munged variable.</p>

<p>It turns out, XR is a reserved word added by the WebXR platform API. When the error occurred “XR” was added in the newest 
version of Google Chrome, but not yet in Firefox. Newer Closure Compiler versions take this into account by providing
an extern for it. It is not always easy to upgrade the ClojureScript version and thus the Closure Compiler used in a project.<br>
In that case, you can fix the problem fast by adding a custom extern of your own:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// externs.js</span>

<span>var</span> <span>XR</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Many times, Advanced Compilation issues with CLJS are easy to avoid with proper preparation. On rare occasions, some
stranger errors can happen. Thus, test your builds with the current browser versions and learn to debug advanced 
compilation issues swiftly to prevent wasting precious time.</p>

		<p>Every year a few thousand startups are incubated in Silicon Valley. Few of them will succeed; the rest will decay or outright fail. Yet there always seems to be room for one more billion-dollar company. Besides appearing seemingly out of nowhere, the most radically successful startups are also the most unpredictable ones. What force seems to create these massive sources of wealth that initially look like “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad ideas</a>”&nbsp;to everybody beside their founders?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to say “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a>,” and you would be correct; however, beside simple acceptance of extraordinarily rare random events, there is deeper mathematical influence over a process that constantly spawns new opportunities. Understanding that influence will help any startup founder or investor to improve his business insights. To understand these concepts better we will make a long journey that will touch upon very foundations of logic and mathematics .</p>

<p>I usually find time to look at about two hundred startups every year. Referrals arrive from other investors, startup founders I mentor or via the massive firehose of demo days at YCombinator &amp; 500 Startups. As you can imagine, this creates an overwhelming supply of startups and innovative ideas to look into. Every startup presents the ultimate question: Is it worth it to invest your time and money? Or is it a waste of both? There is never enough time to dig deep enough into any single startup to understand it fully. Making an investment is not an easy or obvious decision. Yet, over the years, I started to notice certain meta-patterns common to all startups, the patterns that give a tantalizing premonitions on their chances of success or failure. The specifics of an industry or investment cycle might change, yet these patterns remain the same in every decade. I see them as two big groups of patterns: <strong><em>human</em></strong> patterns and <strong><em>mathematical</em></strong> patterns.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png" alt="" width="150" srcset="https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png 263w, https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px">Human patterns emerge from our personal traits. Weather a startup will overcome its human-related challenge is determined by what a person or a team can succeed or fail at. The telltale sign is when the outcome will be determined by quality or quantity of personal efforts. What you typically read in Silicon Valley startup blogs would be all about such human patterns. It will be hundreds of topics covering which software language to use, how to pick founders, how to operate the company, how to build a product, how to build software, what is company culture etc. It’s all good content, yet it only addresses patterns driven by human traits, and thus is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>What you rarely hear about is “mathematical” patterns. These patterns emerge from objective nature of the reality where a startup must operate. The market dynamics, the ecosystem of industries they find themselves in, the governing trends of technological progress. As soon as a startup starts operating in the real world, the vast majority of factors will be outside of a startup direct control or even influence, while having absolutely dominating impact on that startup eventual outcome. Beside now legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a><a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>1</sup></a> making big waves since 2006, there is almost no information on the mathematical fundamentals of startup formation and investing. Usually all you get is a non-actionable statement like “<i>90% of all startups fail</i>” after which the author promptly moves back to human factors, which are much easier to understand and analyze.</p>
<p>To help develop our mathematical intuition we will turn to one of the most profound mathematical results, provided by the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>: <b>The First Incompleteness Theorem</b>. To most it is a seemingly dry statement on the <i>completeness</i> and <i>consistency</i> of <i>formal systems</i>. On a deeper level, however, there is an interesting commonality between the mathematics of incompleteness and startup disruption. It’s critical to understanding the dynamics how startups get born, get big or fail, and finally how the few survivors become legacy companies. Showing this deep connection between mathematics of incompleteness of formal systems and startups will be the purpose of this essay.</p>

<blockquote><p>“[My] own work no longer means much, I came to the Institute merely…to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel.”</p>
<p><em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is surprising that Gödel’s famous theorem is all but unknown in the startup world. Thinking&nbsp; of all the mathematical knowledge that has direct impact on computer science, software and startups I would be hard pressed to come up with anything more powerful than Gödel’s <i>Incompleteness Theorem</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a> is famously named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a>, one of the best-known fixed-point combinators used to construct certain recursive functions. Yet who was the first to define and use a recursive functions? Gödel. Further, the proof that fixed points exist at all is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side effect</a> implicit of his work. Y Combinator is direct descendant<a href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Gödel’s proof.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turing-150x150.png" width="150" height="150"></p>
<p>Consider another cornerstone of computer science, such as Alan Turing’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halting Problem</a>. He created that theorem when working at Princeton, right at the time when discussions about Gödel recent results dominated the institute mathematical debates. Turing’s proof is a continuation of Gödel’s work<a href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Kleene, Turing and Shannon were all standing on the shoulders of the giant – gnome sized Gödel – when they were following his groundbreaking proof and inventing modern computer science. We will review Halting Problem in more details later in this essay.</p>
<p>When you truly grasp the implications of what Gödel actually proved, it will be like opening a Pandora’s box&nbsp; of wonderful insights. The implications of the theorem go far beyond just logic and math. Answers to the most sought after questions such as: <em>Why can everything be made better? Why are so many startups possible and will always be possible? Why things we build tend to get more complex over time? Why does civilization always has room to improve?</em></p>
<p>To answers these questions, and &nbsp;see how all these things are connected mathematically you need to understand Gödel incompleteness.</p>
<h2>A taste of things to come</h2>
<p>Naturally, there is a reason why Gödel theorem is still relatively unknown outside of mathematical circles. There are few big problems. First of all, <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gödel’s proof</a> is <b>hard</b>. Not “<i>learn new computer language</i>” hard, not “<i>make an iPhone game</i>” hard, really, really, <b>really hard</b>. Gödel did not make the task of understanding his theorems easy. Being famously introverted, he preferred the logic of his proofs to do all his speaking for him. Even mathematical education is not much help here. For example, Gödel offers the following preview, a “sketch proof”, what he called an “<i>an intuition</i>” for the real proof to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will define a class <b>K</b> of natural numbers as follows: <b>K</b> = { <i>n</i> ∈ IN | ¬ <i>provable(R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n)) </i>}&nbsp;(where <i>provable(x)</i> means x is a provable formula). K is the set of numbers <i>n</i> where the formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n) </i>that you get when you insert <i>n</i> into its own formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b></i> is improvable. Since all the concepts used for this definition are themselves definable in PM, so is the compound concept <b>K</b>, i.e. there is a class-sign S such that the formula S(n) states that n∈<b>K</b>. As a class-sign, S is identical with a specific <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>, i.e. we have S ⇔ <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>&nbsp;for a specific natural number <strong>q</strong>. We will now prove that the theorem <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> is undecidable within PM. We can understand this by simply plugging in the&nbsp;definitions:&nbsp;<i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> ⇔ <i>S(q)</i> ⇔q ∈ K⇔<b> ¬</b><i>(R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q))</i>, in other words, <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> states “<i>I am improvable.</i>“</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless you are an active mathematician, reading and intuitively understanding his proof would be next to impossible. Just in case here is the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof again</a> in case you enjoy sharpening your mathematical teeth against this amazing whetstone of logic<a href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The second, even bigger problem is that understanding the proof will not help you much. Gödel’s logic is so alien, so strange that even understanding the formal deductions won’t help you understand all the implications of that phenomenon. Gödel’s proof is like a map with “<i>X marks the spot</i>”, yet on that map every border connecting it with our reality is torn away. You have no idea what particular area that map refers to. X is there, treasure is certainly there, but how the heck do you <b>practically </b>use it? In ironic self-referential self-validation Gödel’s formal proof cannot be understood formally. It requires an intuition leap that will unlock its secrets. And after you make that leap your perspective on everything related to startups and innovations will change. That is the insight we will try to develop<a href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>The Theorem</h2>
<blockquote><p>Gödel’s theorem is rapidly becoming accepted as being the fundamental contribution to the foundation of&nbsp; mathematics – probably the <b>most fundamental</b> ever to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Penrose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly has Gödel proving? In modern language, simplified statement will be the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any … <strong><em>formal system</em></strong> capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> and <strong><em>complete</em></strong>. In particular, for any consistent, … formal system that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is <strong><em>true, but not provable</em></strong> in theory</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s work our way through that, since most of the concepts here are actually fairly easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Formal systems</em></strong> are simple things. They are just collections of <b>axioms</b> and <b>rules</b> on how to manipulate them. For example, lets make a few axioms about numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number 0 exists</li>
<li>Each number has a successor that is a number. One follows zero, two follows one, etc.</li>
<li>Two different numbers can not have the same successor</li>
<li>… more axioms if you wish …</li>
</ul>

<p>If we continue writing down such “self evident” axioms, we can arrive at certain set of axioms, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a>. These axioms and few rules of manipulations would constitute the simple arithmetic you learned in kindergarten if not earlier.</p>
<p>Axioms and rules about how axioms can be manipulated to produce derived statements is what constitute a <i>formal system</i>. Systems can be very different from each other. You …</p></div></div>

								<p>On April 28, 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published two final rules that will eliminate the license exception for civil end users (CIV) in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Venezuela and expand military end use and end user restrictions on these countries. These rules confront the national security risks presented by the increasing integration of civilian and military technology development, particularly in China, by requiring U.S. Government review of a broader range of exports including electronics and telecommunications items only controlled for antiterrorism (AT) reasons (with licenses subject to a presumption of denial) when shipped for military end uses or to military end users. These final rules will go into effect on June 29, 2020.</p>
<p>BIS also published a proposed rule that would modify License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR) by restricting the destinations that will be eligible for the license exception. Comments on the proposed rule are also due June 29, 2020.<span id="more-1180"></span></p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Controls Related to Military End Use or Military End Users in China, Russia, or Venezuela</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07241.pdf">first final rule</a> expands license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items intended for military end uses and military end users in China, Russia, and Venezuela, pursuant to § 744.21 of the EAR. Effective June 29, 2020, the final rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imposes a restriction on exports to <u>military end users</u> in China, similar to current requirements for Venezuela and Russia.</strong> Currently, for specified items, EAR Section 744.21 requires a license where the exporter has knowledge that (i) an item destined for China, Russia, or Venezuela will be used for a <u>military end use</u>, or (ii) an item destined for Russia or Venezuela (but not China) will be for a <u>military end user</u>.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The term “military end user,” includes not only “the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations,” but also “<u>any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support ‘military end uses</u>.’”</li>
<li>Many large commercial manufacturers and other companies, particularly in China (as well as Russia and to a lesser extent Venezuela) may conduct some activities in support of a military end use. Under the new rule, it appears that a license may be required to export the covered categories of items (e.g., 3A991 integrated circuits) to such companies, even if the item itself will be used exclusively in connection with commercial applications. If interpreted in this way, the rule could have a broad impact; it will be important to monitor further guidance from BIS. Under any interpretation, exporters will need to focus their due diligence on whether any aspect of their counterparties’ business supports military end uses particularly in China, given what BIS refers to in the rule as “China’s widespread civil-military integration.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Significantly expands the list of items subject to the military end use and end user license requirements in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR</strong> for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela. The list will now also include certain materials processing, electronics, telecommunications, mass market encryption items, sensors and lasers, propulsion, electronics, maritime equipment, and aircraft items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). For example, sending a 3A991 chip, a 5A992 iPhone, or a copy of 5D992 Microsoft Windows to a military end user in China would be subject to this restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Broadens the “military end use” definition. </strong> “Military end use” currently is defined as:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML);</li>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at <a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org</a>);</li>
<li>Incorporation into items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or</li>
<li>For the “use,” “development,” or “production” of military items described above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Use” normally has a conjunctive definition with six elements – meaning all the elements need to be satisfied to constitute “use.” In this case, the final rule expands the “military end use” definition to also include<u> any item that supports or contributes to any one of the elements of “use,” i.e., the operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, “development,” <strong>or</strong> “production,” of military items.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopts a policy of presumption of denial of licenses </strong>for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela for military end uses and end users, rather than the existing case-by-case license review standard. Accordingly, license applications pursuant to EAR § 744.21 will be denied in most cases.</li>
<li><strong>Expands Electronic Export Information (EEI) requirements for all items listed on the CCL that are destined for China, Russia, and Venezuela – independent of end use or value. </strong>Per the Foreign Trade Regulations, many less sensitive AT-controlled items generally do not require EEI reporting at all if their value is less than $2,500, and even if reported, the EEI would generally not need to specify an ECCN. The final rule requires EEI reporting to identify specific ECCNs for tangible exports of all items listed on the CCL to China, Russia, and Venezuela, with very few exceptions. As a result, even if a company does business with these countries entirely in the commercial realm, its export reporting obligations may change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elimination of License Exception Civil End Users (CIV) </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07240.pdf">second final rule</a> eliminates License Exception CIV. License Exception CIV currently authorizes the export of certain items that are controlled for national security (NS) reasons provided that the items are destined to civil end users for civil uses in Country Group D:1, which includes, among others, China, Russia, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iraq. A number of items currently may be exported under License Exception CIV, including certain telecommunication equipment and computers. Accordingly, as of June 29, 2020 companies will no longer be able to utilize License Exception CIV.</p>
<p><strong>Modification of License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/28/2020-07239/modification-of-license-exception-additional-permissive-reexports-apr">third rule</a> is a proposed rule that would modify License Exception APR, which currently authorizes the reexport of certain items from Country Group A:1 or Hong Kong to destinations in Country Group B (so long as the destination is not also in Country Groups D:2, D:3, or D:4) and Country Group D:1. The rule proposes removing destinations in Country Group D:1, including China, as eligible recipients of national security-controlled items reexported under License Exception APR.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2008, Facebook was the hot new thing, and social media had <em>just</em> started rising. One of my high-school classes was about trying to understand that shift better.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We read about past problems with mass media, and thought about how they might manifest in new media. To that end, we read a German novel called <em>The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum</em> by Heinrich Böll. In recent years, with social media-induced cancel culture becoming a hot issue, that novel has been on my mind frequently.</p> <p>A quick summary:</p> <blockquote> <div><p>Katharina is a 27-year old housekeeper. She’s frugal, earnest, and hard-working – a model citizen. One evening, she meets a man named Ludwig at a party, and sleeps with him. Next day, the police knocks on her door: he’s a known communist terrorist, and suspected for robbery and murder. Katharina is taken in for questioning, and released. </p><p>  This episode is observed by a reporter for the tabloid NEWS. The reporter inquires with neighbors, stretches any statements, and publishes a piece declaring Katharina to be a gold-digging communist criminal, the depraved bride of a murderous terrorist. Katharina is swiftly excluded from society and receives death threats. Under the onslaught of harassment, her hospitalized mother dies from stress. </p><p>  In the meantime, Ludwig is found to have committed no robbery or murder, but by then, the campaign against Katharina has become its own force. One sympathizer argues that the actual facts are good, and that other newspapers are reporting the facts, but – as Katharina points out through her sobs – it doesn’t matter, because <em>everyone</em> reads the NEWS. </p><p>  For no fault of her own, Katharina’s life is in shambles: her career is over, and her friends distance themselves for self-preservation. In desperation, she tries to meet with the reporter who has been hounding her. The reporter tries to extort her for sex, whereupon she shoots him. Remorseless, she turns herself in to the police for justice.</p></div> </blockquote> <p>The 70s were a heyday for tabloid newspapers. Printing any scandal, no matter how thin the facts, the tabloids were like the clickbait outrage mills of today. Their reach was wide and deep: the NEWS of the novel was a depiction in all but name of the leading tabloid in Germany, BILD, which printed six million copies every day, purchased by one in ten Germans. To be depicted unfavorably in BILD was social execution, and – as a paper dealing primarily in outrage and gossip – BILD executed plenty. Capricious and careless, their reporters had the power to ruin lives effectively at random.</p> <p>That sounds a lot like getting cancelled: for effectively no fault of your own, the outrage mob, whether online or offline, can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak#Vocabulary">unperson</a> you. While today’s media are global and more plentiful, it’s not clear that there’s been a net change in impact. Getting smeared by your local tabloid was just as radioactive as is getting smeared on Reddit, a career-ender all the same. Further, even though traditional, local media has a much smaller reach than global media, its local reach is what really matters to the person affected. Local media has a much deeper local reach, and a much greater capacity to “investigate” and report locally. While modern media operate at much greater scale, it also carries a dilutive effect. Net-net, people have always been getting disgraced, and I don’t think it’s much likelier now than it was in the past.</p> <p>In my view, cancel culture is an example of a pattern I like to call <em>there’s nothing new under the sun</em>: there are always scary changes between generations, but usually they are just new manifestations of issues as old as time. For example, many people today complain that the young spend less time on necessary schoolwork than the previous generation. But even Socrates said the exact same thing. In many domains, perceptions of progress have been pessimistic since antiquity – perhaps because memories of times past are always rose-colored by nostalgia – but reality works out.</p> <p>If today’s severity and randomness of cancel culture is not actually new, is it different in any important respects? Today’s cancel culture is one of escalating purity tests: born out of the more punitive contingents on the left, it’s not enough to not be a racist or a sexist, but one must take stronger, more condemnatory views, which function as powerful in-group signals.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Cancel culture is thus somewhat performative, and strongly ideologically motivated – some people are likening it to the witch hunts for communists in the 50s under Joseph McCarthy. The left is in a curious, self-damaging position, where lots of center-leaning moderates – who are genuine progressives – are not meeting the ideological standards of those further left, which functions to their exclusion, thereby weakening the left overall.</p> <p>Is that bad? Yes, probably. While I view the aims of social justice as largely correct and well-intentioned, cancel culture seems to produce unnecessary collateral damage that hurts its own cause. It both fragments the left – infighting over purity is a devastating waste in a time beset by serious problems requiring collective action – and it is unfair to the people it ultimately affects. But is any of this new? I don’t think it is. It’s the same old patterns and motivations under new cover. Thus, like everyone else, we acknowledge cancel culture as a trend, but unlike everyone else, we see it as a trend that is very <em>old</em> rather than <em>new</em>. In turn, the question we ask about is radically different: while everyone else asks “how has technology given rise to cancel culture”, we know that it hasn’t, and instead ask “how can we use technology to mitigate cancel culture?”</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0e74a9a2acebd70c05fe"><div><p>For the three years starting in April of 2017, I ran much of <a href="http://theprepared.org/newsletter" target="_blank">The Prepared’s</a> (and ultimately my family’s) income through Patreon. I started doing so as an experiment - one that by any measure has been a success. But while Patreon was instrumental in that process, I recommend that creators <strong>not</strong> structure their incomes and careers around Patreon. Here’s why.</p><p>Like many creators, I chose Patreon’s “pay by the creation” (rather than “pay by the month) mode. This directly incentivizes creators to continue doing the actual work, and keeps them accountable to the commitments they make. </p><p>But what Patreon doesn’t tell you is that fans can optionally set a monthly cap on their spending, and that cap can be arbitrarily low - even <strong>less than your per-creation commitment level.</strong> In other words, a reader of my weekly newsletter could pledge $5 per newsletter, but then set a $2 monthly cap. The worst part about this is that there’s literally nowhere in the Patreon backend that I can see this cap. I spoke to Patreon’s product team about this in late 2018, and they told me that the best thing I could do is to look at my creation-by-creation analytics at the end of the month and see which of my patrons paid for which creations; if a person doesn’t show up at the end of the month, then they must have set a cap.</p><p>This is a totally unscalable solution, and it makes the process of issuing patron rewards excruciatingly hard to manage. Creators need the ability to quickly and easily determine <strong>who</strong> is paying them for <strong>what</strong>; Patreon makes this impractically hard.</p><p>Further:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593267194369_49688"><div><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Patreon provides email alerts for when a new patron makes a pledge, but has <strong>no email or push notifications for when patrons delete pledges.</strong> </p></li><li><p>Patreon has no creator-side notification system for declined charges or charges that are flagged for fraud. Worse yet, their patron-side notification system appears to be totally ineffective; many long time patrons (and personal friends of mine) were genuinely shocked to hear, many months later, that their monthly charges had been declined - leading to their pledges being automatically canceled by Patreon. Even worse, Patreon’s “Declines” page, which shows the total declined amount on a month by month basis, has no way of showing which patrons’ pledges were declined - you instead need to go into the “Relationship Manager” and filter by “Declined” to see whose charges have gone through, and when.</p></li><li><p>If you, as a creator, go through all of the effort to find charges that<em> </em>have been declined or marked as fraud, it can then be really difficult to recoup that revenue. This is mostly a result of the fact that most Patreon creators charge a small amount of money (a couple dollars) per month. In theory you could email or message the patron when their charge doesn’t go through, but in practice it feels a bit weird to be hounding someone over (say) $4. If the pledge was billed on an annual basis, though, it might be a big enough sum to warrant the effort. </p></li><li><p>Patreon uses accounting terms with little regard for their generally accepted meaning. See the screenshot above, which is titled “Earnings Projections” but then actually lists <em>gross revenue.</em> In accounting, <em>earnings</em> is the same as <em>profit - </em>it’s what a company has left <strong>after every expense is paid, </strong>whereas <em>gross revenue</em> is the total amount that a company takes in and doesn’t take into account expenses at all. In other words, Patreon is suggesting that the numbers here are what will be deposited into my bank account - but once Patreon takes their platform fees, it’ll actually be significantly less. This kind of sloppy terminology is all over Patreon’s creator backend, and no matter how you slice it is either the result of gross incompetence or a deliberate desire to deceive creators.</p></li></ul><p>Between credit card processing fees (2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction) and Patreon’s cut (between 5% and a whopping 12%), your earnings will be <em>significantly</em> less than your top line pledged amount. In practice, I saw total fees of between 8-12%. (Note: I signed up for Patreon before they shifted to tiered pricing, and now have a “Founder” Pro plan at a 5% platform fee rate. If you signed up for a Pro or Premium account today, you’d pay Patreon 3% or 7% more than I do, respectively.)</p><p>If Patreon were actively bringing customers to me - if normal people were just out there browsing Patreon for awesome things to support - then that might make sense. <strong>But the reality is that success on Patreon is inextricably tied to having your own platform and community.</strong> All Patreon does is manage recurring payment processing - a commodity service that many companies do for a drastically lower fee structure. Sure, ostensibly you can also be having conversations with patrons, generating some kind of community there, etc - but every step you take to encourage users to interact with you on Patreon, the more you undermine your own platform. In other words, Patreon engages in rent seeking - but they ultimately do it on <strong>your</strong> platform, and don’t bring a built-in audience with which to raise you higher.</p><p>When I transitioned off of Patreon, I moved to a combination of Quickbooks Online ($645/year; note that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank">Intuit is a terrible company</a>) and Squarespace’s ($480/year) recurring products feature. The result is that my processing fees dropped dramatically. At my peak Patreon earnings, I was spending almost $300/month ($3600/year) on Patreon’s platform fees. My current revenue is roughly 3x what it was then, but I’m paying 68% less than I used to be.<strong> My current payments, web hosting, and accounting software outlay is $1,125 a year; if I had remained on Patreon my annual fees would be about $10,000.</strong></p><p>Okay, you’re saying - so Patreon isn’t the perfect all-in-one platform that will allow me to bill, chat with, and build my audience. But maybe it’s a piece of a larger puzzle?</p><p>It’s a great idea, but unfortunately Patreon does a terrible job integrating with the other services that I use to run my business.</p><p>The first thing I’d want from Patreon is an easy way to automatically share my content (which most creators distribute elsewhere - for me, it’s Mailchimp) to Patreon. But while Patreon does have a public API, it’s poorly developed (there is no sandbox/testing area, and the most recent updates to <a href="https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-python" target="_blank">their API libraries</a> are from January of 2019) and only allows browsing/looking up data on Patreon; you cannot post content to your Patreon account via the API. This lack of functionality also exists in Zapier’s implementation of the Patreon API: You can use Patreon as a trigger, but not as an action.</p><p>What this means is that creators are inherently tied to Patreon’s terrible, horrible, clicky clicky GUI. You are completely tied to the limitations that are built into Patreon’s web product, and don’t have the ability to build automations that’ll speed up your content and customer management.</p><p>Patreon also fails to integrate well with accounting software - something that flies in the face of their promise to give creators “the stability you need to build an independent creative&nbsp;career.” Their API (and Zapier’s implementation of it) only provides <em>pledge</em> activity, and is therefore inaccurate (caps, declines, and fraud aren’t factored in - it’s a guesstimate at what you might make in the future) in all of the ways described above.</p><p>I really can’t stress this enough: <strong>If your intention is to build a meaningful income, there are much better options out there than Patreon. </strong>What Patreon <em>does</em> offer is a quick way to see whether people on the internet will pay you a little money for something that you’re already doing for free. </p><p>This is a nontrivial thing, but it’s something that you should really think through before you start a Patreon page. If it’s a success, then it’ll likely make a lot of sense for you to transition <em>off</em> of Patreon at some point in the foreseeable future. That might be fine - especially if you’re really early on and success feels like a longshot - but The Prepared’s transition off of Patreon required a lot of management on my part and resulted in roughly 1/3 of my patrons dropping their pledges. </p><p>To be clear: I’m deeply appreciative of all of the people and companies who supported me through Patreon, and it really is true that those first couple of dollars made a big impact in the path of my career. But Patreon as a platform did remarkably little to support me along that journey, even after I became a moderately successful creator and took quite a bit of time to explain my frustrations to both their customer service &amp; user research teams.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?</p><cite>Epictetus</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bill Shannon passed away a few days ago after a long, valiant battle with cancer. The reality is Bill had a very long standing, selfless and profound impact on the entire Java ecosystem if not IT at large. It is also reality that far too few people understand this truth. In this blog post, I am going to attempt to do my part in closing this gap and honor a very good man that will be missed greatly.</p>



<p>Bill started his storied career with DEC and UNIX. He was the 11th employee of Sun Microsystems, alongside luminaries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Joy</a>. When J2EE was being formed, Bill was recruited to help lead the effort and remained in that role through the technology’s transition to Java EE and now Jakarta EE under the Eclipse Foundation. Bill is listed as lead or co-lead on all of Java EE platform releases. He played an instrumental role in the historic transfer of the technology from the JCP to the Eclipse Foundation. Bill was also the principal developer for Java Mail, now Jakarta Mail.</p>



<p>The following excerpt from his farewell note to his colleagues represents his accomplishments well:</p>



<blockquote><p>I started at Sun (as employee #11) by bringing SunOS to life. Just as wild success was within reach, we stretched a little too far and signed a deal with AT&amp;T. That set us back almost 5 years, but at least I have the “black edition” of Solaris signed by Eric Schmidt – “I’m Sorry”. Next it was time to move on to learn about window systems, desktop applications, and industry consortiums in the form of CDE. CDE was moving much too slowly and in 1996 a new opportunity presented itself – Java. We tried a Java machine, a JavaOS, and a Java desktop environment – Hotjava Views. None of that really panned out until Java found its home as an application server environment, first named J2EE and then named Java EE. I was recruited as leader of this new effort, which has subsequently been given a new name and new leadership – Jakarta EE at the Eclipse Foundation.</p></blockquote>



<p>His contributions to Java, Java EE and Jakarta EE truly cannot be overstated. He left his mark on the technology set in a way few other people have. His interactions with me, while anecdotal, perhaps is a good reflection of who he really was, what he did and why he will be missed.</p>



<p>I first encountered Bill when I began contributing to Java EE 5 as an independent consultant, on my own time. Bill made sure I felt welcome, behind the scenes gave me background technical information that I needed and encouraged me to be outspoken. He valued my contributions and understood they came at the cost of significant personal sacrifices. I believe he also implicitly understood the challenges of being an immigrant, a person of color, someone with obvious Islamic heritage, at heart a non-conformist and a non-vendor in a forum and industry that lacked diversity and still does. Without that early support from Bill, I am not sure I would have continued on with Java EE. I still vividly remember what he once told me:</p>



<blockquote><p>Don’t underestimate your impact. I appreciate your passion. You can make a difference in a way I don’t think you understand. There will be resistance, but don’t give up. </p></blockquote>



<p>Bill was equally welcoming and supportive when I joined Oracle as Java EE evangelist. He made sure my ideas were voiced, heard and considered, even if we did not always agree. He was happy to empower me to fulfill my community facing role even at JavaOne while shunning the limelight himself. I now also know how many good fights he tirelessly fought behind the scenes so that the effort we both cared about kept moving forward.</p>



<p>Beyond Oracle, Bill was always quietly supportive of community efforts like the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java EE Guardians and the Jakarta EE Ambassadors</a> after it. He remained supportive until the end of his days – taking the time to help draft the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/getting-involved/guide-for-helping-deliver-jakarta-ee-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guide to Helping Deliver Jakarta EE 9</a>.</p>

<p>Bill passed at home with his family and close friends. He is succeeded by his wife and two daughters. Rest in peace Bill. Bill and his family were private people. With the blessings of his family, I hope to hold a virtual tribute event to honor Bill together publicly as a community. If this materializes, I will keep folks posted.</p>

<p>I believe the best way to truly honor Bill is to carry forward his life’s work embodied in Jakarta EE. I hope you will take a moment to consider the long service of this good man on all our behalf and also consider being a part of the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jakarta EE</a> journey.</p>

One of my favorite<a href="#foot1" id="cite1">¹</a> concepts for multi-dimensional data visualization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">Chernoff Face</a>. The idea here is that for a dataset with many dependent variables, it is often difficult to immediately understand the influences one variable may have on another. However, humans are great at recognizing small differences in faces, so maybe we can leverage that!</p><h2>
Tired: traditional plotting</h2><p>
The example from Wikipedia plots the differences between a few judges on some rating dimensions:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png"><img data-original-height="750" data-original-width="1000" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png" width="320"></a></p><p>
which already improves on the "traditional" way to present such data, which is something similar to a line chart:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="353" data-original-width="583" height="193" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p>
or a radar chart:</p><p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="356" data-original-width="591" height="192" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>


<p>
Clearly<a href="#foot2" id="cite2">²</a> the Chernoff faces are the best way to present this data, but they leave some of the gamut unexplored.</p>

<h2>
Wired: using GANs to synthesize faces</h2>


<p>
The GAN technique is pretty easily summarized. You set up two neural networks, a generator, which tries to generate realistic images, and a discriminator, which tries to distinguish between the output of the generator and a real corpus of images. By training the networks together, adding more layers, fooling around with hyperparameters and overall "the scientific process", you manage to get results where the generator network is able to fool the discriminator (and humans) with high-quality images of faces that do not actually map to anybody in the real world. StyleGAN improves on some of the basic structure here by using a novel generator architecture that stacks a bunch of layers together and ends up with an intermediate latent space that has "nice" properties.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/n9fgba8b0qr01.png"><img data-original-height="1461" data-original-width="1600" height="292" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/n9fgba8b0qr01.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p><i>Basically how it works.</i></p>
<br>
<div><p>
A trained StyleGAN (1 or 2; the architecture for the dimensions does not change between versions), at the end of the day, takes a 512 element vector in the latent space "Z", then sends it through some </p><strike>nonsense</strike><p> fully-connected layers to form a "dlatent"<a href="#foot3" id="cite3">³</a> vector of size 18x512. The 18 here indicates how many layers there are in the generator proper—the trained networks that NVIDIA provides produce 1024x1024 images; there are 2 layers for each of the dimensions from 2^2=4 to 2^10=1024.</p></div>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="767" data-original-width="267" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="111"></a></p>
<p><i>What part of STACK MORE LAYERS did you not get?</i></p>
<br>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>The upshot is that the 18x512 space has nice linearity properties that will be useful to us when we want to generate photorealistic faces that only differ on one axis of importance. The authors of the NVIDIA paper call each of the 18 layers a "style", and the observation is that copying qualities from each style gives qualitatively different results.</p><p>

The styles that correspond to coarse resolutions bring high-level aspects like pose, hair style, face shape; the styles that correspond to fine resolutions bring low-level aspects like color scheme. But they only roughly correspond to these, so it's going to be somewhat annoying to play around with the latent space! What we need is some way to automatically classify these images for the properties we want to use in our Chernoff faces...</p></div>
<p>
<br>
<h3>
Putting it all together</h3>
</p>
<div><p>
What I did was take an <a href="https://github.com/rosasalberto/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x">unofficial re-implementation of StyleGAN2</a> and run it to generate 4096 random images (corresponding actually to random seeds 0 - 4095 in the original repository). The reason why we're using an unofficial implementation is that the unofficial implementation ports everything to TensorFlow 2, which also enabled me to run it with (a) less GPU RAM (I only have a GTX 1080 at home) and (b) on the CPU if needed for a future project where I serve these images dynamically.</p><p>

I was also too lazy to train a network to recognize any features, so I fed these images through <a href="https://www.kairos.com/pricing">Kairos</a>'s free trial, receiving API responses that roughly looked like <a href="https://pastebin.com/PXWDKkYf">this</a>. (There's no code for this part, you can just do it with cURL<a href="#foot4" id="cite4">⁴</a>).</p><p>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>Then, somewhere in this <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/play_around_with_directions.ipynb">gigantic unorganized notebook</a>&nbsp;that I need to clean up, I train some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Linear_SVM">linear SVMs</a> to split our sample of the latent space; eventually I will clean this up and make it so it's a little more automated than the crazy experimentation I was doing. After I train the SVMs and receive the normal vector from their separating hyperplanes, I manually explore the latent space by considering only one style's worth of elements from each of the normal vectors, plotting the results, and seeing what changes about the photos (which could be different than the feature from the API response!). This could probably be automated; I should likely use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy">conditional entropy</a> of the Kairos API responses given the SVM result to rank which styles are most important and then automatically return that instead of manually pruning styles.<br>
<span><br></span>
<span>I ended up with seven usable properties plus one I threw out before I got tired of doing this by hand.</span></p><ul>
<li>yaw</li>
<li>eye squint</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>smile</li>
<li>skin tone</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>hair length</li>
<li>quality of photo</li>
</ul>
<div><p>
I decided not to use quality of photo (you can see the results in the notebook results) because I didn't want half the photos to just look terrible. The good news is that I made <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/chernoff_faces.ipynb">a new notebook</a> for generating the actual faces, one that should actually work for you if you clone the repo.</p><p>

After generating a few images and using the `montage` command from ImageMagick, we get our preliminary results!</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/out.png"><img data-original-height="426" data-original-width="512" height="331" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/out.png" width="400"></a></p>

<br></div>
<p>
Now that's the future!</p>

		<p>Between roughly 1975 and 1995, access to computers accelerated much more quickly than access to computer networks. First in the United States, and then in other wealthy countries, computers became commonplace in the homes of the affluent, and nearly ubiquitous in institutions of higher education. But if users of those computers wanted to connect their machines together – to exchange email, download software, or find a community where they could discuss their favorite hobby, they had few options. Home users could connect to services like CompuServe. But, until the introduction of flat monthly fees in the late 1980s, they charged by the hour at rates relatively few could afford. Some university students and faculty could connect to a packet-switched computer network, but many more could not. By 1981, only about 280 computers had access to ARPANET. CSNET and BITNET would eventually connect hundreds more, but they only got started in the early 1980s. At that time the U.S. counted more than 3,000 institutions of higher education, virtually all of which would have had multiple computers, ranging from large mainframes to small workstations.</p>
<p>Both communities, home hobbyists and those academics who were excluded from the big networks, turned to the same technological solution to connect to one another. They hacked the plain-old telephone system, the Bell network, into a kind of telegraph, carrying digital messages instead of voices, and relaying messages from computer to computer across the country and the world.</p>
<p>These were among the earliest peer-to-peer computer networks. Unlike CompuServe and other such centralized systems, onto which home computers latched to drink down information like so many nursing calves, information spread through these networks like ripples on a pond, starting from anywhere and ending up everywhere. Yet they still became rife with disputes over politics and power. In the late 1990s, as the Internet erupted into popular view, many claimed that it would flatten social and economic relations. By enabling anyone to connect with anyone, the middle men and bureaucrats who had dominated our lives would find themselves cut out of the action. A new era of direct democracy and open markets would dawn, where everyone had an equal voice and equal access. Such prophets might have hesitated had they reflected on what happened on Usenet and Fidonet in the 1980s. Be its technical substructure ever so flat, every computer network is embedded within a community of human users. And human societies, no matter how one kneads and stretches, always seem to keep their lumps.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Tom Truscott was living the dream life for a young computer nerd. A grad student in computer science at Duke University with an interest in computer chess, he landed an internship at Bell Labs’ New Jersey headquarters, where he got to rub elbows with the creators of Unix, the latest craze to sweep the world of academic computing.</p>
<p>The origins of Unix, like those of the Internet itself, lay in the shadow of American telecommunications policy. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs decided in the late 1960s to build a leaner, much pared-down version of the massive MIT Multics system to which they had contributed as software developers. The new operating system quickly proved a hit within the labs, popular for its combination of low overhead (allowing it to run on even inexpensive machines) and high flexibility. However, AT&amp;T could do little to profit from their success. A 1956 agreement with the Justice Department required AT&amp;T to license non-telephone technologies to all comers at a reasonable rate, and to stay out of all business sectors other than supplying common carrier communications.</p>
<p>So AT&amp;T began to license Unix to universities for use in academic settings on very generous terms. These early licensees, who were granted access to the source code, began building and selling their own Unix variants, most notably the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix created at the the University of California’s flagship campus. The new operating system quickly swept academia. Unlike other popular operating systems, such as the DEC TENEX / TOPS-20, it could run on hardware from a variety of vendors, many of them offering very low-cost machines. And Berkeley distributed the software for only a nominal fee, in addition to the modest licensing fee from AT&amp;T.<sup id="fnref-13802-fee"><a href="#fn-13802-fee">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Truscott felt that he sat at the root of all things, therefore, when he got to spend the summer as Ken Thompson’s intern, playing a few morning rounds of volleyball before starting work at midday, sharing a pizza dinner with his idols, and working late into the night slinging code on Unix and the C programming language. He did not want to give up the connection to that world when his internship ended, and so as soon as he returned to Duke in the fall, he figured out how to connect the computer science department’s Unix-equipped PDP 11/70 back to the mothership in Murray Hill, using a program written by one of his erstwhile colleagues, Mike Lesk. It was called <em><span>uucp</span></em> – Unix to Unix copy – and it was one of a suite of “uu” programs new to the just-released Unix Version 7, which allowed one Unix system to connect to another over a modem. Specifically, <em>uucp</em> allowed one to copy files back and forth between the two connected computers, which allowed Truscott to exchange email with Thompson and Ritchie.</p>

<p>It was Truscott’s fellow grad student, Jim Ellis, who had installed the new Version 7 on the Duke computer, but even as the new upgrade gave with one hand, it took away with the other. The news program that was distributed by the Unix users’ group, USENIX, which would broadcast news items to all users of a given Unix computer system, no longer worked on the new operating ssytem. Truscott and Ellis decided they would replace it with their own 7-compatible news program, with more advanced features, and return their improved software back to the community for a little bit of prestige.</p>
<p><span>At this same time, Truscott was also using <em>uucp</em> to connect with a Unix machine at the University of North Carolina ten miles to the southwest in Chapel Hill, and talking to a grad student there named Steve Bellovin.<sup id="fnref-13802-bellovin"><a href="#fn-13802-bellovin">2</a></sup> Bellovin had also started building his own news program, which notably included the concept of topic-based <em>newsgroups</em>, to which one could subscribe, rather than only having a single broadcast channel for all news. Bellovin, Truscot and Ellis decided to combine their efforts and build a networked news system with newsgroups, that would use <em>uucp</em> to share news between sites. They intended to distributed provide Unix-related news for USENIX members, so they called their system Usenet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Duke would serve as the central clearinghouse at first, using its auto-dialer and <em>uucp</em> to connect to each other site on the network at regular intervals, in order to pick up it local news updates and deposit updates from its peers. Bellovin wrote the initial code, but it used shell scripts that operated very slowly, so Stephen Daniel, another Duke grad student, rewrote the program in C. Daniel’s version became know as A News. Ellis promoted the program at the January 1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, Colorado, and gave away all eighty copies of the software that he had brought with him. By the next Usenix conference that summer, the organizers had added A News to the general software package that they distributed to all attendees.</p>
<p>The creators described the system, cheekily, as a “poor man’s ARPANET.” Though one may not be accustomed to thinking of Duke as underprivileged, it did not have the clout in the world of computer science necessary at the time to get a connection to that premiere American computer network. But access to Usenet required no one’s permission, only a Unix system, a modem, and the ability to pay the phone bills for regular news transfers, requirements that virtually any institution of higher education could meet by the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Private companies also joined up with Usenet, and helped to facilitate the spread of the network. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) agreed to act as an intermediary between Duke and UC Berkeley, footing the long-distance telephone bills for inter-coastal data transfer. This allowed Berkeley to become a second, west-coast hub for Usenet, connecting up UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and others, including Sytek, an early LAN business. The connection to Berkeley, an ARPANET site, also enabled cross-talk between ARPANET and Usenet (after a second re-write by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman to create B News). ARPANET sites began picking up Usenet content and vice versa, though ARPA rules technically forbid interconnection with other networks. The network grew rapidly, from fifteen sites carrying ten posts a day in in 1980, to 600 sites and 120 posts in 1983, and 5000 sites and 1000 posts in 1987.<sup id="fnref-13802-sitesandposts"><a href="#fn-13802-sitesandposts">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Its creators had originally conceived Usenet as a way to connect the Unix user community and discuss Unix developments, and to that end they created two groups, <em>net.general</em> and <em>net.v7bugs</em> (the latter for discussing problems with the latest version of Unix). However they left the system entirely open for expansion. Anyone was free to create a new group under “net”, and users very quickly added non-technical topics such as <em>net.jokes</em>. Just as one was free to send whatever one chose, recipients could also ignore whatever groups they chose, e.g. a system could join Usenet and request data only for <em>net.v7bugs,</em> ignoring the rest of the content. Quite unlike the carefully planned ARPANET, Usenet self-organized, and grew in an anarchic way overseen by no central authority.</p>
<p>Yet out of this superficially democratic medium a hierarchical order quickly emerged, with a certain subset of highly-connected, high-traffic sites recognized as the “backbone” of the system. This process developed fairly naturally. Because each transfer of data from one …</p></div></div>

June 29, 2020 | https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>The <acronym>npm</acronym> ecosystem seems unwell. If you are concerned with security, reliability, or long-term maintenance, it is almost impossible to pick a suitable package to use — both because there are 1.3 million packages available, and even if you find one that is well documented and maintained, it might depend on hundreds of other packages, with dependency trees stretching ten or more levels deep — as one developer, it’s impossible to validate them all.</p>

<p>I spend some time measuring the extent of the problem.</p>

<p>I suggest that this is a social problem, more than a technical one, and propose a semi-social solution: a human-maintained subset of the total registry, based on shared criteria by which a “healthy” package can receive a seal of approval. One criterion would be to only depend on other approved packages.</p>

<h3 id="the-premise">The premise</h3>

<p>I don’t like the way I feel when I’m installing packages with npm. Selecting a package, installing it, discovering the 93 additional packages that were installed along with it, and hoping all of <em>them</em> are also suitable for my project… it feels out of control.</p>

<p>I feel unhappy because picking dependencies is hard, so I blame npm, and that way my problems are not my fault.</p>

<p>Is there some way for me to measure this badness, and thus more thoroughly escape the blame?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-a-bit-like-a-scientist-but-not-too-much">Thinking a bit like a scientist, but not too much</h3>

<p>Can we make meaningful empirical measurements of the health of the <acronym>npm</acronym> registry? I think so; but before I do, in order to maintain the slightest semblance of impartiality, I want to lay out what I <em>expect</em> a healthy package registry to look like. If it turns out that npm, taken as a whole, mostly looks the way I expect a healthy registry to look, I’ll have to put my tail between my legs and take ownership of my struggles. If it looks wildly different, I’ll still have hope for blaming the system.</p>

<h3 id="imagining-a-healthy-repository">Imagining a healthy repository</h3>

<p>In my ideal world there are, mostly, 4 types of packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Utilities:</strong></p>

    <p>A utility is a simple package, with no dependencies, that accomplishes a single small but onerous task. For example: lodash is a collection of utilities (and you can install each one separately). Controversially, left-pad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Libraries:</strong></p>

    <p>A library is one step up in abstraction. It may depend on a handful of utilities, and it accomplishes a whole set of related tasks. For example: urlib has just a few simple dependencies, and while it does many things, it respects a clear unifying principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frameworks:</strong></p>

    <p>A framework provides scaffolding for an entire project, and may depend on multiple libraries and utilities. You should only ever need zero or one of these in your project. Examples: React, angular, express.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plugins:</strong></p>

    <p>A plugin enhances a framework with additional, special-use functionality. For a plugin, the framework should be a peer dependency, not a true dependency. It might also depend directly on a library, or a handful of utilities. Examples: an angular component or a jquery plugin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the world is messy! I don’t expect 100% of packages to fit into such simple categories, nor are any of these definitions strict and unyielding. But overall, I’d hope <em>many</em> or even <em>most</em> packages to <em>mostly</em> conform to a categorization <em>something</em> like that, with most packages being utilities and libraries, and the fewest packages being frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-that-mean-statistically">What would that mean statistically?</h3>

<p>In a world where packages fit mostly into that hierarchy, a registry of many packages would have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No dependency cycles</li>
  <li>Most packages would have dependency trees 0-4 levels deep, leaning towards lower numbers</li>
  <li>Even the deepest and broadest frameworks would depend on fewer than 250 packages, including dependencies of dependencies (3-4 steps deep, with 3-4 dependencies per package, &lt;= 4<sup>4</sup> max). Most packages would install well under 30 other packages. These numbers are extremely generous; smaller numbers would make me even happier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-we-actually-see">What do we actually see?</h3>

<p>I downloaded the metadata for all 1.3 million packages in the npmjs.org repository and attempted to crunch some numbers. (For more technical details on how I did this, see the final section, titled “Appendix: Methods”)</p>

<p>I’m going to use “the number of other packages that depend on this one” as a poor-man’s proxy for how popular a package is. It’s not a <em>good</em> proxy, but neither is the other common choice: the number of downloads (see the section <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/#background">“Background”</a>, from PyPI). The number of downloads would have been much more computationally expensive to acquire, so I used dependents.</p>

<h3 id="circular-dependencies">Circular dependencies</h3>

<p>Of those 1.3 million packages, 1,700 depend directly on themselves, either perfectly circularly, or a different version of the same package. I have no explanation for that.</p>

<p>2500 packages are part of a two-package dependency cycle.</p>

<p>Then ~500, ~125, and ~25 are part of 3-, 4-, and 5-package cycles, respectively. (These are not always simple circles; it may be three codependent packages in any loopy arrangement)</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was that those numbers seemed like good news; out of a million packages, only a tiny percentage of oddball packages have circular dependencies, and the rest are fine. Right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what I discovered was that almost 150,000 packages — more than 1 in 10 — had at least one of these circular dependencies <em>somewhere</em> in their dependency graph. That means at least a few of those “oddballs” are actually major, highly-referenced packages. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>babel-core</code> depends on <code>babel-register</code>, which depends on <code>babel-core</code>.</li>
  <li><code>yeoman-generator</code> depends on <code>yeoman-environment</code> which depends on <code>yeoman-generator</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not isolated instances; I plucked them as the most easily recognizable out of a list of dozens of highly-depended-upon packages with circular dependencies.</p>

<p>I need to be clear, here, that this is not <em>technically</em> a problem! <acronym>npm</acronym> can install these packages just fine. They can circularly-depend on one another; there’s no technical problem. They work. Obviously. If <code>babel-core</code> didn’t work, someone would have said something by now.</p>

<p>But I’m not particularly comfortable with it. I’m especially uncomfortable when the cycles involved are longer than two packages, which makes them seem less intentional. Maybe there’s a good reason; these folks are smart, and I always try to assume that odd choices were made for important reasons. And yet…</p>

<h3 id="what-about-devdependencies">What about <code>devDependencies</code>?</h3>

<p>Among the most-depended-upon packages are</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@types/</code>[something]</li>
  <li>compilers like <code>typescript</code> and <code>babel</code></li>
  <li>build systems like <code>gulp</code> and <code>webpack</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m <strong>not</strong> measuring that using <code>devDependencies</code> — <code>typescript</code> appears in over 12,000 “dependency” lists.</p>

<p>So while I am less concerned with packages having large and deep <code>devDependency</code> trees (I <em>am</em> still concerned, but less so), it seems that a large proportion of packages aren’t making use of the distinctions between <code>dependencies</code> and <code>devDependencies</code> in the first place. That <em>is</em> concerning.</p>

<h3 id="dependency-tree-depths">Dependency tree depths</h3>

<p>I am defining the depth of a package’s dependency tree as the longest dependency-of-a-dependency-of-a-dependency chain I can find. Especially deep dependency trees are a problem because of how difficult they make it to audit all the packages that will get installed when including a single new package.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> dependency tree depth in npmjs.org is just under 4. Which doesn’t sound too bad!</p>

<p>As often happens, though, the mean does not tell the whole story. Almost half of all packages have no dependencies at all — which is a good thing! — but all those zeros dramatically drop the average of the packages that <em>do</em> have dependencies.</p>

<p>If we charted of the number of packages with each dependency tree depth greater than zero, then based on the idealized registry I imagined above, here’s what I’d hope to see:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>And here’s what we actually get:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth.svg" alt="Real chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Remember that we were hoping for mostly 2, 3, and 4. Instead, there is still a long tail of packages with tree depths <em>above 20</em>. 20 is… much larger than I was expecting, and I was expecting to be disappointed.</p>

<p>But let’s re-use the “oddball” theory: perhaps all those packages with extremely deep dependency trees are rarely used, and not worth worrying about. Let’s check.</p>

<p>Here’s a scatterplot, where each package is placed based on its tree depth plotted and how many other packages reference it. On the right of the plot are the most-referenced (~popular) packages; on the top are the deepest dependency trees. Again, my hopes first:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Followed by reality:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents.svg" alt="Real scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>There are heaps of 10+ tree-depths up among even the most popular packages, and a few even reach 20+. Extremely deep trees are not just a problem of “oddball” packages.</p>

<h3 id="direct-dependencies-branching-factor">Direct dependencies (branching factor)</h3>

<p>The average number of direct dependencies (among packages with any dependencies at all) is 5. That, by itself, doesn’t seem to bad. It feels a little alarming when combined with high tree depths, though. Does that mean some of these packages have 5<sup>10</sup> total dependencies? (Spoiler: no.)</p>

<p>Here’s a graph of how many packages have 1 dependency, 2 dependencies… up to 30 — a nice, neat exponential decay.</p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_direct_dependencies.svg" alt="Chart of package counts per direct dependencies"></p>

<p>This curve is clean enough that I would not be surprised to see something pretty similar in any package registry — maybe not the exact same parameters, but a similar shape. Not shown here is an <em>incredibly</em> long tail; there are 4 packages tied for the most direct dependencies with exactly 1000, and there are runners-up spread pretty smoothly up to that maximum.</p>

<h3 id="indirect-dependencies">Indirect dependencies</h3>

<p>Knowing the average depth and branching factor, you have to imagine that counting the total dependencies of each package, including dependencies-of-dependencies, is not going to yield good news. But many of the branches of a large dependency tree are shared — multiple packages in the tree all depend on the same library. And the tree depth I have measured is the <em>maximum</em> depth for each package — not the average. So the picture is not necessarily as dire as an initial …</p></div></div>

		<p>PicToBrick is a <span>software to generate mosaics</span> from digital pictures. The materials to construct the mosaic as well as their colours and forms can be chosen freely. For mosaics constructed  by <span>Ministeck®</span> and <span>LEGO®</span> PicToBrick provides complete system configurations. These configurations contain information for current colours and respectively forms of elements and can be modified and enlarged user-defined.</p>
		<p>To get results as good as possible for different master illustrations seven methods of  colour definition (quantisation) are at your disposal. In addition you can choose between five methods to define the element forms (tiling).</p>
		<p>Besides the produced mosaic picture PicToBrick provides a multitude of different output documents. Among other things they contain a list of materials, a construction manual as well as information about the utilised colours and forms of  material.</p>
		<p>PicToBrick was completely developed in <span>JAVA</span> and can be used <span>cross platform</span> (Windows, Linux, Mac). The software is published as <span>open source</span> under GPL2. Furthermore PricToBrick is <span>free</span>.</p>

Today, we're going to show you how you can scan files and directories for sensitive information like secrets.

      <b>Policy Break:</b> GitGuardian scans more than just secrets, we also scan for high risk file extension (example: keystore) and file names (example: .env), when we detect something that breaks the rules of our policies, we call this a policy break. 
</p><p>

In this guide I'll show you how to use sidetable <span>and</span> where it could be a good fit <span>in</span> your data science workflow<span>.</span> 

As we explore sidetable<span>,</span> we'll use the penguins dataset that was recently added to the <span>[</span>seaborn<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>seaborn<span>.</span>pydata<span>.</span>org<span>/</span><span>)</span> visualization library<span>.</span> The penguins dataset <span>is</span> mean to be a replacement <span>for</span> the overused <span>[</span>iris<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>archive<span>.</span>ics<span>.</span>uci<span>.</span>edu<span>/</span>ml<span>/</span>datasets<span>/</span>iris<span>)</span> dataset<span>.</span> If nothing <span>else</span><span>,</span> it adds some variety <span>and</span> allows us to show some penguin pictures<span>.</span> 😀</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
Pandas <span>is</span> the exploration tool <span>for</span> data analysts <span>and</span> data scientists who use Python<span>.</span> 🐼  The pandas API <span>is</span> large <span>and</span> oriented around data cleaning <span>and</span> data wrangling<span>.</span>
The new <span>[</span>sidetable<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>chris1610<span>/</span>sidetable<span>)</span> package adds convenience methods to DataFrames<span>.</span> These methods make it easier to see missing values<span>,</span> counts of values per column<span>,</span> subtotals<span>,</span> <span>and</span> grand totals<span>.</span> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>

We<span>'ll read in the Antartica penguins dataset directly from a .csv file at the GitHub repository that hosts seaborn'</span>s datasets<span>.</span> 

The data were collected <span>and</span> made available by Dr<span>.</span> Kristen Gorman <span>and</span> the Palmer Station<span>,</span> Antarctica LTER<span>.</span> See more info <span>[</span>here<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>allisonhorst<span>/</span>palmerpenguins<span>)</span><span>.</span>

Let's put the data <span>in</span> a pandas DataFrame <span>and</span> check out the first few rows<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div data-cy="code-cell"><div><p>df_penguins <span>=</span> pd<span>.</span>read_csv<span>(</span><span>'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv'</span><span>)</span>

Alternatively<span>,</span> this dataset can be loaded through seaborn <span>if</span> you install <span>[</span>seaborn<span>]</span><span>(</span>http<span>:</span><span>//</span>seaborn<span>.</span>pydata<span>.</span>org<span>/</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> `<span>import</span> seaborn <span>as</span> sns` <span>and</span> run `df_penguins <span>=</span> sns<span>.</span>load_dataset<span>(</span><span>'penguins'</span><span>)</span>`<span>.</span> 

After reading a new dataset into DataFrame<span>,</span> my <span>next</span> move <span>is</span> to use `df<span>.</span>info<span>(</span><span>)</span>` to get some information about it<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>We see some basic info about our <span>6</span> columns <span>and</span> <span>344</span> rows<span>.</span>

Let's see how sidetable can <span>help</span> us explore our data<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>!<span>[</span>Adelie Penguin<span>.</span> source<span>:</span> pixabay<span>.</span>com<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>storage<span>.</span>googleapis<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>published<span>-</span>content<span>/</span>sidetable<span>-</span>pandas<span>-</span>methods<span>-</span>you<span>-</span>didnt<span>-</span>know<span>-</span>you<span>-</span>needed<span>/</span>adelie_penguin<span>.</span>png<span>)</span> Adelie Penguin<span>.</span> source<span>:</span> pixabay<span>.</span>com</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
All sidetable methods use the `<span>.</span>stb` accessor<span>.</span> For more about the pandas accessor API<span>,</span> see this <span>[</span>post<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>pbpython<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>sidetable<span>.</span>html<span>)</span> by Chris Moffit<span>,</span> the author of sidetable<span>.</span>


The first sidetable DataFrame method we<span>'ll check out is `stb.missing()`. Here'</span>s how to use it<span>:</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div data-cy="code-cell"><div><p>df_penguins<span>.</span>stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>The result <span>is</span> a DataFrame <span>with</span> the number of missing values per column<span>,</span> ordered by most to fewest<span>.</span> It also displays the total number of rows <span>and</span> the percentage of missing values <span>for</span> each column<span>.</span>

With `df<span>.</span>info<span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>,</span> we would have had to do the arithmetic <span>in</span> our head<span>.</span> 🤔

Alternatively<span>,</span> we could see <span>all</span> the missing values by column <span>with</span> `df<span>.</span>isna<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>But `df<span>.</span>isna<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>` doesn<span>'t include the percentages and isn'</span>t nicely formatted<span>.</span> Speaking of nice formatting<span>,</span> let<span>'s make sidetable'</span>s output prettier<span>.</span> 💐</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div data-cy="code-cell"><div><p>df_penguins<span>.</span>stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span>style<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Passing `style<span>=</span><span>True</span>` cleans up the <span>*</span>Percent<span>*</span> column formatting<span>.</span>

Now let's look at the sidetable DataFrame method `<span>.</span>stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>,</span> the main course <span>in</span> the sidetable package<span>.</span> 🍲

Yo<span>u've seen how you can use sidetable to quickly display missing values, make nicely formatted frequency tables, and show grand totals and subtotals. It'</span>s a handy little library<span>.</span> 👍



Here's a recap of the API<span>:</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display helpful information about missing values<span>.</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display counts<span>,</span> percents<span>,</span> <span>and</span> cumulative information <span>for</span> columns<span>.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_29_0ee">

<div>
<p>Facebook’s rise popularised the ‘News Feed’ as a social, infinitely scrollable aggregation of content posted by your family, friends and liked pages. Made up of ‘news’ closer to the home, the feed was largely composed of personal milestones, announcements, photo albums etc. But in late 2019 Facebook introduced a beta feature called the ‘News Tab’ that’s now been rolled out in the US this month, an entirely separate feature to the News Feed that focuses on aggregating news from vetted sources based on user curation. Though not immediately obvious, this is in fact a step toward its more private and personal approach to the platform – here we’re talking about the aggregation and distribution of news and journalism moving closer to its readership, with user-curated and distributed news bringing mainstream media into the fold of the user’s smaller, more personal circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that the premise of Facebook remains largely social, the introduction of this feature doesn’t necessarily mean all users will jump at the opportunity to actively curate and share news. It’s even located oddly offscreen where users need to click on the three-line “hamburger” and then find the news box amid other menu options. The News Tab rather represents a point of distribution, where the users who do actively participate will take on the role of curators for their respective networks within the platform. If successful, the News Tab represents a shift in the power of news distribution – away from publications and toward power users who have the ability to propagate information through the social network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why do users hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are two factors that enable users to hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem and they’re very much intertwined.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Private virality&nbsp;</li><li>Improved efficiency of sharing, discovery and signalling</li></ol>



<p>While private virality sounds like an oxymoron, it simply alludes to the nature of virality (the quick circulation of some media from one internet user to another) within the more private context of a circles-based social media platform like Facebook. To understand why the ‘private’ is an operative term lets explore the characteristics of user propagated information within social circles:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Greater levels of trust as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of sharing</strong></li><li>Greater alignment of interests as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of discovery&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Greater level of social signalling – social capital generated from social signalling to family and friends is stickier than capital generated in forums like Twitter and Reddit → <strong>improved efficiency of signalling</strong></li></ol>



<p>The virality of user propagated news on Facebook is stronger for the traits it carries as it passes through social channels, even the most tenuous social link is stronger than the links that currently exist between the public and media sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nature of private virality creates improved efficiency of discovery, sharing and signalling –&nbsp; creating a feedback loop that makes it a stronger and stronger proposition each time. Imagine that you, as a reader, discover an article that resonates with you on the source’s primary website (e.g. a NY times or WSJ) and decide to share it with your social or professional circles – at present this requires the added step of ‘porting’. Either follow a share link or copy and paste the article onto another platform. While this step is trivial in nature it signifies a disconnect between the source and destination of information in social networks, a disconnect that the Facebook News Tab would transform into one fluid motion (News Tab to News Feed) making private virality even easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiency in sharing, both in terms of ease and relevance, creates better discoverability and in turn, makes for stronger signalling. The incentive to remain a connector node or user who distributes information and the incentive to continue consuming user propagated news appear much clearer and stronger than in the absence of the feature. Publishers, who are still able to tap into other avenues of propagation can expect to relinquish the propagation power within social networks to such connectors or power users –&nbsp; who in this instance are simply more effective distributors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why has Facebook empowered its users as its distributors of information?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Typically news aggregators or publications act as the point of distribution, resulting in externally curated news feeds. Facebook is banking on shifting the externally determined distribution of news from Facebook or publishers, towards user-centric curation and propagation. It’s important to note that this adds value to the core user base of Facebook (regardless of whether they interact with the News Tab or not), where most consumption will take place in the personal feeds that these connector nodes share news to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of Facebook’s social capital and a news aggregator tab is not typically available to other mediums of news distribution. This places Facebook in a unique position to not only become an effective news aggregator but also compound on the user stickiness to the platform – essentially extending their core value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why the News Tab is different to previous attempts</h3>



<p>Facebook’s previous iterations of news features like the Open Graph platform in 2011 and Instant Articles in 2015, failed to gain traction and were eventually phased out. This was primarily because Facebook introduced the news as an extraneous element to users’ primary use of Facebook which is to connect with friends and family. Open Graph, which auto shared articles users were reading at the time, came at a time when the platform was still consolidating its social focus. When Facebook changed its feed post design and deprioritised social reader apps in 2012, the platform was abandoned. Instant Articles – an in-application news content hosting feature – suffered a similar fate, it was abandoned in 2017 when Facebook’s restrictions around the content was affecting subscription conversions and ad revenue for the publishers using the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, Facebook decreased the presence of news in users’ personal feed from 5% to 4% to prioritize content from friends and family. This was Facebook deprioritizing news when it remained a peripheral element of the social network. The introduction of the News Tab, in a time when Facebook is more comfortably able to expand its proposition, speaks to Facebook’s newer strategy of prioritizing user-centricity across all of the platform’s experiences. The quote below, found on Facebook’s media page, is indicative of the platform’s shift to bring news into the fold of more personal experiences:</p>



<p>“Our goal with News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you, every time you visit Facebook. Your News Feed is a personalised, ever-changing collection of photos, videos, links and updates from the friends, family, <strong>businesses and news sources</strong> that you’ve connected to on Facebook.”</p>





<p>
<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Connectors and the tipping point for information dissemination in social networks</h3>



<p>In his magnum opus, The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell introduces the actors within a network who all have a role to play in the dissemination of information within a network. He references the ‘maven’ – a person who is innately knowledgeable or pursues knowledge and information, the ‘salesman’ – a person with the innate ability to convince others and ‘connector’ – a person with vast social reach and a predisposition for connecting others together.</p>



<p>“But in the case of Connectors, their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy.”</p>



<p>Gladwell’s litany on Lois Weisberg, a socialite in 1950s Chicago, is demonstrative of the power of ‘connectors’ to marry information from disparate ends of a network into cohesive and emphatic outcomes.</p>



<p>“if you looked harder at Weisberg’s life you could probably subdivide her experiences into fifteen or twenty worlds… The point about Connectors is that by having a foot in so many different worlds, they have the effect of bringing them all together.</p>



<p>“I [Lois Weisberg] said, do you know anyone in Chicago interested in talking to Arthur Clarke. He said, yeah, Isaac Asimov is in town.”… This is in some ways the archetypal Lois Weisberg story. First, she reaches out to somebody, to someone outside her world. Then, equally important, that person responds to her.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating to modern social networks, the concept of the ‘connector’ is very much still at the heart of information dissemination – where the networking platforms themselves are now the connector – democratising access to information and reach for their millions of users.</p>

<p>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the credo of Klutz Press, the most important book publisher of my childhood. It being summer and all, Hobbes, ol' buddy... let's going exploring!</p>
<h2>What makes a Klutz Press book so good for learning stuff?</h2>
<p>If you've heard of Klutz, then you've likely seen their debut: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932592007/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0932592007&amp;linkId=adaa512e8af09feab7c571ec8f2863cc">Juggling For the Complete Klutz</a>. </p>

<p>If not, I highly suggest seeking out a copy. Keep in mind, it's more than just a <em>book</em> -- <em>Juggling for the Complete Klutz</em> has these amazing attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's spiral-bound</li>
<li>It has hilarious drawings</li>
<li>It comes attached with three real-life bean bags!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are book super-powers, in my book (a Klutz-worthy pun?). In our day, my sister and I owned, devoured, and treasured these Klutz titles:</p>

</ul>
<p>As a kid, there was nothing better than getting a new Klutz book (ok, maybe a Super Nintendo game). But unlike a replay of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, these Klutz books require no nostaglia goggles. Here's why I think they're magic:</p>
<h3>Klutz books are spiral-bound</h3>
<p>Books for learning stuff should be able to open up and stay flat. The old 1980s computer manuals for computers like the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, and <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer">my new old Apple IIe</a> knew this much -- their manuals were spiral-bound and spell-binding.</p>
<p>So, why don't we see more spiral-bound books? Without knowing that much about printing costs, I imagine they're more expensive. Also, they do look slightly worse on a bookshelf, especially if you're going for that 'grammable color pattern look (so, just don't do this).</p>
<h3>Klutz books come with the required materials</h3>
<p>The little "paper" football that came with the <em>Table Top Football: A Guide to the Classic Lunchroom Sport</em> was a revered grail of mine. I remember that my dad took a sheetrock knife and made a small incision in its plastic case attached to the book so that the football could be slid in and out, with the explicit rule that the football must either be <em>in the case</em> or <em>being used in a game</em>. This is much like the inexorable <a href="https://hypercritical.co/">Jon Siracusan</a> rule for Airpods. Obey, or the Airpods will be instantly lost forever.</p>
<p><span>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="football" title="football" src="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/20f07/football.jpg" srcset="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/d2f63/football.jpg 163w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Side note that there are some people who just love making small cuts into the plastic cases for things, so that you easily return them to their "pristine" condition. I, myself, don't understand these people. I like wripping these cases to shreds instantly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to these Klutz books. By including juggling bean bags, yarn for friendship bracelets, or a real harmonica, Klutz Press books gave you everything you needed to get your hands dirty. "Active learning", or something like that. Playing = learning. Etcetera.</p>
<h3>Klutz books have hilarious art</h3>

    </span></p>
<p>Just look at that paper airplane stuck in the teacher's hair!</p>
<p>Klutz had a particular art direction that spoke to me as a child. The goofy people in their guides made me feel like it was <em>okay to be a klutz</em>. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important reason that Klutz books are special.</p>
<h3>Klutz books embrace the Beginner's Mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the experts mind there are few - Shunryū Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone starts out as a klutz. No matter what. That means it's okay to make mistakes. It can even be funny - in fact, it should be funny! Because it's fun to learn new things.</p>
<p>Being a klutz, making mistakes, having fun, this is the path to wonderful things.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutz_Press">Wikipedia</a>, Klutz Press was founded in 1977 by three friends in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>The apocryphal story is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(author)">John Cassidy</a>, a recent Stanford grad working as a high school teacher, brought a bucket of tennis balls and some hand-written instructions for juggling to his remedial reading class. The laughs and learning and genuine reading and genuine juggling that ensued inspired Cassidy and his buddies from Stanford to publish <em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> under their new company: Klutz Press.</p>
<p><em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> has sold over 2.5 million copies. But Googling for Klutz Press is somewhat challenging these days. In 2000, Klutz was acquired by a company called Nelvana for $74 million, and in 2002 Klutz became a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc. This latter merger is a good match in my book, as the Scholastic Book Fair also ranks heavily in my childhood memories of learning to love reading. The only other company I'd feel comfortable with owning Klutz Press is Pizza Hut - thanks to their delicious <a href="https://www.bookitprogram.com/">BOOK-IT!</a> reading program, which brought me dozens of delicious cheese Personal Pan Pizzas during the 1990s. My parents couldn't decide if they hated or loved Pizza Hut for this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Klutz.com redirects to the Scholastic website, and it's unclear what's out-of-print or available from the voluminous Klutz catalog. So if you do find a genuine Klutz book and kit, I'd snag them quickly!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a good interview with Cassidy from 1995 on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182712/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v83/ai_16857996/">Wayback Machine</a>. In 1995, Klutz was at the height of their power and influence in kid's minds. Here are some choice quotes from Cassidy:</p>
<p>On their company culture at Klutz Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of being laid back, we take a back seat to nobody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On their "teaching" style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Talk to a kid about fun and math, and it's like you're talking about two different sides of the universe. If we can climb this mountain, there's nothing we can't tackle."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kids don't learn all that much by listening or reading. They need to get elbow-deep in a subject and touch it, feel it, and smell it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Seymour Paypert's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046746/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0465046746&amp;linkId=2949aefc36d4bd9d9f632170d2ac23de">Mindstorms book</a> about his work with LOGO and the Turtle machine (you can check out <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/mindstorms">my notes</a> on the book)</p>
<p>The article explains a bit about their business:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of Klutz' books sell for less than $20</li>
<li>They can have low prices because: (1) the books (with their accompanying "stuff") are viewed as more than books - but "toys/novelties", so more retailers than booksellers are interesting in carring them, and (2) they do large printing runs (150k copies vs the usual 10k for children's books)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, importantly, the final word from Cassidy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can hang a spoon off my nose," Cassidy boasts, "and I take a lot of pride in that".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</h2>
<p>I just wanted to write that out again. I've decided to adopt their credo as my own life motto.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Klutz Press as a kid. I'm still learning now. Thank you, John Cassidy and team, for making these wonderful books. My juggling is finally starting to get pretty good, but I'll always be a klutz.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><header></header><a id="article"></a><p>The first blog post I wrote was lost, the oldest one I kept is from September 8, 2005. It’s been almost 15 years and I am very happy to see how much better I got in writing and in understanding the world.</p><p>Keeping a site like this is not just about writing and choosing photos. It takes curation and revising how things are organised to make sure nothing gets lost.</p><p>One of the things that I didn’t want to lose were the comments from all the amazing people that have stopped by and given some of their time to show appreciation or disagreement. The last one is always a good opportunity to learn and make sure your beliefs are still sound and logic.</p><p>So I dove into the database of comments, finding some of them lost and misplaced because the website’s posts changed links.</p><p>Some of the links were broken and had to be pieced together; others were wrong and their comments gone.</p><p>I believed I saved all of the comments and in the process drove down an avenue of memories and hindsight on fragile the web we built is.</p><h2 id="photos-and-images">Photos and Images</h2><p>Remember flickr ? It’s still alive and running but not everyone I knew back in 2007 still uses it. A lot of the photos you see in my old posts come from there, but the attribution link is broken because the user decided to delete their account. Some are still working, but the photographer moved on, or passed away.</p><p>Those links are still here for historical reasons, and because it is important to show that those photos have owners, talented people that were kind to share their work without asking for return.</p><p>And the problem doesn’t stop at the attributions of copyright that land in a “Page Not Found” message. Even the files seem to deteriorate.</p><p>As technology evolved, we got better cameras and better monitors. Photos that were pristine now look faded or pixelated. Storage was also a problem. Keeping a website means storing all the files and for a 25 year old with a small budget that meant saving every cent. So I made sure to keep a good balance in image quality and file size. It didn’t do an amazing job resisting the test of time.</p><h2 id="files-and-websites">Files and websites</h2><p>Websites have a life cycle, and some of the links I found no longer work. Google hates broken links as much as I do, but I also hate to be unjust to the reader. Links that point to other resources, that no longer exist, are still present in the articles I wrote. Again, for the reason of proof of existence.</p><p>I have known of this problem for a while now, and for that reason I got into the habit of saving every file that I use for reference. PDFs, videos, images, music, etc. They may not be used in the article, because there is a link to the original version or author, but if one day that link stops working, the value won’t be lost with it. (This is why this site amounts to over 9 GB)</p><p>Back in the day, like many, this site was powered by WordPress. It had it’s own comment system. Then disqus<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> appeared, and I tried it for a while. After I stopped using WordPress, I kept the same comment service running. This was when all the links changed to improve the Search Engine Rankings, and a lot of comments got lost in the database.</p><p>Remember Path? How about any of these?</p><ul><li>Delicious</li><li>FriendFeed</li><li>Google Wave</li><li>Jaiku</li><li>MySpace</li><li>Orkut</li><li>Posterous</li><li>Shelfari</li><li>Vine</li></ul><p>The list could go on, the point is that they have disappeared and some good content along with them.</p><p>And a social network doesn’t have to vanish for you to lose access to what’s there. The owner of a piece of content may lock their profile for any number of reasons and you or your readers won’t be able to see it ever again.</p><p>Legal action on copyright infringement can also take away access to something that was public. Just think about what happens when a YouTube video is found to be at fault with the guidelines.</p><h2 id="we-have-built-a-fragile-web">We have built a fragile web</h2><p>And we are making some of the same mistakes. Think about how many Social Networks use URL shorteners. What happens if Bit.ly decides to close and all those links stop working?</p><p>The websites that we are building use content management software like WordPress, Drupal and others. Will they withstand the test of time or will we have to migrate them to a new system at some point? Trick question, it won’t. Until then we can stay true to our mission and keep on publishing.</p><p>If you were hoping for a bright ending, please don’t give up just now.</p><h2 id="fragile-and-amazing">Fragile and Amazing</h2><p>Through these ordeals and all the experiments we have been running in the way we can communicate among ourselves, we saw a lot of good come out of it. Creators that could have gone unnoticed for ages found a spotlight.</p><p>Social Networks have found business models that are more or less stable without infringing on our privacy. Take <a href="https://patreon.com/">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://etsy.com/">Etsy</a> as an example.</p><p>We have built an economy and services that were important when dealing with the covid-19 lock down.</p><p>And if we fight fake news, we are able to see a variety of important perspectives about what is going on in the world. We can connect with a Human who lives across the ocean and who happens to play guitar.</p><p>The web we built is a living thing and is faced with challenges today. It grew too fast, got infected by fake news and scams. In the meantime, it helped us see what is wrong in our society through the Arab Spring and the Black Lives Matter movements.</p><p>It’s up to us to curate and educate. We should try to make sure that we publish with quality in mind and take steps to see it live on as much as possible. And we have to educate each other on how to use the web and how not to be a victim of misinformation and fake news.</p><p>That’s the only way that we can make sure that communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/">Random Acts of Kindness</a> stay alive to serve as inspiration on how amazing the web can be.</p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/VeUSCLJrLf4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Photo by jason leung"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-1px;fill:#fff" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><title>Unsplash Logo</title><path d="M20.8 18.1c0 2.7-2.2 4.8-4.8 4.8s-4.8-2.1-4.8-4.8 2.2-4.8 4.8-4.8c2.7.1 4.8 2.2 4.8 4.8zm11.2-7.4v14.9c0 2.3-1.9 4.3-4.3 4.3h-23.4c-2.4.0-4.3-1.9-4.3-4.3v-15c0-2.3 1.9-4.3 4.3-4.3H8l.8-2.3c.4-1.1 1.7-2 2.9-2h8.6c1.2.0 2.5.9 2.9 2l.8 2.4h3.7c2.4.0 4.3 1.9 4.3 4.3zm-8.6 7.5c0-4.1-3.3-7.5-7.5-7.5-4.1.0-7.5 3.4-7.5 7.5s3.3 7.5 7.5 7.5c4.2-.1 7.5-3.4 7.5-7.5z"></path></svg></span><span>jason leung</span></a><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Disqus is a worldwide blog comment hosting service for web sites and online communities that use a networked platform.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/demo.gif"></p><p><em>See bigger version of the above demo as .gif <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwplotka/bingo/master/examples/bingo-demo.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></em></p><p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>bingo</code></a>, a simple and efficient CLI (Command Line Interface) Tool ,
I wrote for managing versions of Go binaries that are required for your project development.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: <code>bingo</code> is built on top of the native <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules dependency management</a> and in my opinion,
it solves the hard problem of flexible versioning developer tools written in Go. It already improves our integration with tools in the
production-grade projects like <a href="https://thanos.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanos</a>. Check it out and contribute!🤗</strong></p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/automation.gif" alt="This is NOT what you want to do in your project..."><figcaption>This is NOT what you want to do in your project...</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Automation is <strong>amazing</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Especially nowadays, all projects, whether open or closed source, use at least bunch of tools to automate some tasks. For example in Go community
you can see following popular tools:</p><ul><li>Running tests: <code>go test</code>, <code>go test -race</code></li><li>Benchmarks: <code>go bench</code>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp?tab=doc" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchcmp</code></a>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchstat</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/funcbench" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>funcbench</code></a></li><li>Auto formatters: <code>go fmt</code>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goimports</code></a></li><li>Static analysis: <code>go vet</code>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>golangci-lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/fatih/faillint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>faillint</code></a></li><li>Documentation Generators: <a href="https://github.com/campoy/embedmd" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>embedmd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/cfggen" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">docs auto generators</a></li><li>Build tools: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goreleaser</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/promu" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>promu</code></a></li><li>Other projects (!) you want to run integrations tests against.</li><li>…and millions of other tools: <a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">website builder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/raviqqe/liche" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">link check</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/copyright" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">copyright checker</a>, protobuf + gRPC generation, jsonnet generators and bundlers, <a href="https://github.com/brancz/gojsontoyaml" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">YAML tools</a>, etc…</li></ul><p>I could list even more, and to be honest, I am so amazed with the amount of things we have <strong>for free</strong>! They help to maintain a very good quality of the
project, and saves an enormous amount of time.</p><p>So what projects do? They obviously tend to use gazillion of those tools, reusing amazing ideas and solid code that someone else in open source wrote
and maintains every day with love.</p><p>That’s great, but how many times you have cloned the project, want to contribute run <code>make</code> and see things like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
zsh: command not found: clang
zsh: command not found: goimports
zsh: command not found: goreleaser
zsh: command not found: hugo
</code></pre><p>And that’s even a nice error! Usually, you get a confusing error that does not make any sense like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
dafg;lkghd;lsfjgpdsjgp 
zsh: exit 1
</code></pre><p>…because you have the required tool installed but <strong>WRONG version</strong> of it!</p><p>Now, if you want to be a nice project to work with, you give a hand and either print meaningful errors and tells how
to install a dependant tool and what version of it, in case of users not having a tool or have the wrong version installed. This is
a step in a good direction, but in my opinion <strong>we can do much better.</strong></p><p>In all projects I maintain, we tried hard to be even more explicit and helpful by ensuring our scripts will install all dependencies
needed manually. We also largely leverage a good, old school <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Makefile</code></a> for tasks like this.
It is as easy as:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL = $(GOBIN)/tool 

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
	@do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
	@install tool
</code></pre><h2 id="always-pin-the-version">Always Pin the Version</h2><p>The above example works great, but obviously will not always work if you require a <strong>certain</strong> version of the tool.
If you would remember only one thing from this blog post, remember this:</p><blockquote><p>You really want to pin version of ALL the tools your project depends on!</p></blockquote><p>Why? Well, the quick answer is that versioning is hard and things are constantly moving. Tools are being improved and changed every day.</p><p>Trust me, the last things you want to do is to investigate why CI constantly fails or have the spam of bugs and issues, about someone, somewhere
being unable to build your project because of an obsolete, or a too new tool that was required.</p><p>We can easily extend our above <code>Makefile</code> example to improve resiliency and development experience by pinning tools’ versions
and maintaining immutable binary files.</p><p>Immutable binary names safeguard us from accidental usage of the wrong version that might have been installed outside. There is nothing worse than chasing a non-existing issue, only to realize you use the wrong version.</p><p>Without immutability, we would have to checksum and verify all build to ensure the correct version which is doable, just a bit more complex to maintain. (BTW, how nice it would
be to have CLI <code>man</code> equivalent for printing <code>version</code>! (: ).</p><p>We can achieve immutable binary names, as follows:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION = v1.124.3
DEPENDENCY_TOOL        = $(GOBIN)/tool-$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
   @do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL) 

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool-v1.124.3 file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
   @install tool@$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)
   @cp tool $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
</code></pre><p>Version pinning was easy, right? Now, fun stuff, how can we reliably install those tools in the required version? Let’s look at possible solutions:</p><h3 id="commit-built-dependant-binaries-straight-to-your-vcs-e-g-git">Commit built, dependant binaries straight to your VCS (e.g git) 😱</h3><p>This is usually <strong>a bad idea</strong>. While it might work for you, other users would probably want to run your software on different
machines with different architectures and different operating systems, etc. And even if you would host all permutations of
each required binary, each can “weight” from 10-100MB which is most likely too much for common VCSs (e.g <code>git</code>). This
will make it extremely slow, if not impossible to clone your project. Plus there is no merge conflict resolution that
works well for binary files.</p><p>Hope I made this clear: Please don’t do this. (:</p><h3 id="use-package-manager">Use Package Manager</h3><p>Now, this is what’s usually recommended, and it looks innocent.</p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" alt="Use Package Manager they said..."><figcaption>Use Package Manager they said...</figcaption></figure><p>The idea would be to use the package manager available on the user’s OS e.g. <code>apt</code> <code>yum</code>, etc.</p><p>I will stop here because in practice this is impossible. Let’s look at the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While there are standard package managers for major operating systems, some people might not use it (you can disable it).
On top of there are 99% chances that the amazing tool you need is not packaged there or the version available is extremely old.</li><li>There are other custom pkg managers like <code>snap</code>, <code>brew</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>pacman</code> <code>NuGet</code> <code>pip</code> but not everybody has them
preinstalled, so it’s <code>chicken &amp; egg</code> problem.</li><li>Most of the tools work only with tools written in a certain programming language that is NOT Go (:</li></ul><h3 id="curl-released-binaries">Curl Released Binaries</h3><p>You can probably get quite far with just automatic <code>curl</code> of pre-built binary against the certain operating system, released on
GitHub by authors. Unfortunately, again, in practice, not many projects maintain that. Especially, for a small tool, it’s an overkill.</p><h3 id="pre-build-container-images">Pre-Build Container Images</h3><p>That is quite a fancy solution and has many benefits (portability, isolation, etc). This is great but comes with the tradeoff of
long and non-trivial bake times, overhead, and latency when running a job inside a container.</p><p>On top of that, you have to most likely share files between guests and hosts, which is always clunky and problematic (permissions, paths, file ownership, etc).</p><h3 id="solution-pin-certain-version-of-source-code-instead">Solution: Pin Certain version of Source Code Instead!</h3><p>Have you spotted a certain pattern among all the tools I mentioned in <a href="#automate-all-the-things">Automate all the things!</a> section?</p><p><strong>Yes! They all are written in <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go</a>.</strong> The Go community believes in automation, so the amount of tools that was produced is <strong>impressing</strong>. And those are NOT only useful for Go projects but actually any project of it. Tools written in Go tend to be extremely reliable and very easy to maintain and fix. You should try writing your own tooling in Go as well, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxc8B2fjDvY" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this amazing video</a> from our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fatih" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Fatih</a> ❤️ on how to write language tool (e.g linter).</p><p>So, if we assume all our tools will be written in Go, does this simplify our life? The answer is: Yes!</p><h4 id="rant-about-go-modules">Rant About Go Modules</h4><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" alt="Calling Go Modules for help!"><figcaption>Calling Go Modules for help!</figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago Go Team released its sophisticated answer for dependency problem in Go Community: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules</a>.
It (usually) works and it’s quite amazing for many reasons:</p><ul><li>It is decentralized. Anyone can publish their code, anywhere.</li><li>Finally, Go projects do not need to be inside <code>$GOPATH</code></li><li>Supports using multiple different (major) versions of the same module in the same build.</li><li>It is ~secure. HTTPS and SSH are the default and <code>go.sum</code> exists to verify checksums.</li><li>Supports caching proxies/mirroring.</li><li>Semantic Import Versioning</li><li>It is an official tool, which means finally a single standard. They are also built-in other Go tools.</li></ul><p>But let me say this loud and clear: <strong>It’s also far from being perfect.</strong> Consider the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It assumes everyone uses <strong>semantic versioning</strong> properly.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Halo Go Team, can I have your attention for a second? 🤗</p></blockquote><p><strong>99.9% of Go projects do NOT use semantic versioning properly and NEVER will be!</strong></p><p>It’s because maintainers either have no time, don’t care or they simply semantically version their APIs or part of packages only. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/prometheus-developers/Go$20Modules%7Csort:date/prometheus-developers/F1Vp0rLk3TQ/TyF2WxlkBgAJ" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed
discussion on this matter in Prometheus (30k stars’ project) mailing list.</a></p><p>This leads to most of the problems users experience. You can’t escape from a huge amount of <code>replace</code> hacks.
Plus, instead of making it easier for such use cases, Go blames others. ):</p><p>This is also why <code>bingo</code> was needed and why I built it.</p><ul><li><p>We build and import packages, but version modules. If you add an overhead of maintaining modules and releasing it (see the above issue),
it’s clear that maintaining multiple modules is not a good answer.

<p>If you go to the Wikipedia page for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_and_Clyde_Canal">Forth and Clyde Canal</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_line_(London_Underground)">the London Circle Line</a> you may notice that they all have route maps with a similar visual style.</p>

  <figcaption>A route map of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Subway">Glasgow subway</a> from Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How do the many Wikipedia contributors create all these similar-looking maps? The answer is <strong>BSicons</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bsicons">BSicons</h2>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon">BSicons</a> are the building blocks for these route maps. They are an SVG icon set that Wikipedia contributors use to map railways, subways, footpaths, waterways, cycle paths and roads. Any transport system that they want to produce a simplified schematic for.</p>

  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicon_grid.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway. The diagram is made up of square icons in a grid which is highlighted">
  
  <figcaption>The Glasgow subway map is made up of many BSicons icons. Most are square, but there are a few half-width icons too that allow for a more compact map.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The icons were first used on the German Wikipedia which is why most of their names are based on German words.
‘BSicons’ comes from the German word Bahnstrecken (Railway Lines).</p>

<p>Each icon has a shorthand name that follows some conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>Root</strong> picks a given icon such as a station or a crossing.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefixes</strong> change it’s status, such as if it’s underground or disused.</li>
  <li><strong>Suffixes</strong> denote direction and positioning, such as if it curves to the left or is one way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the icons:</p>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_STR.svg">
    <h3>STR</h3>

  Suffix: <b>+l</b> → <b>+</b> (from), <b>l</b>inks (left)</p><p> Directions are relative to the line (which is drawn from top to bottom) rather than the page. This is why the suffix says the line is from the left rather than going to the right.</p>
</div>

<div>

  Suffix: <b>ho</b> → <b>h</b>ochbahn (high level/elevated), <b>o</b>verpass
</p></div>

<p>These are a few examples. The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon/Catalogue">BSicon Catalogue</a> explains many more conventions.</p>

<h2 id="building-maps">Building maps</h2>

<p>To help put all these icons together into a map Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Routemap">Routemap template</a>. The template defines a syntax to provide shortcuts to build maps.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicons_row.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway loop that shows one line of icons highlighted.">
  
  <figcaption>Routemaps are made up of rows of icons </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is the code used to generate the single highlighted row:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{Subway|Hillhead}}! !\utkBHF+1\\\utkBHF+4\tSTRa~~{{Subway|St George's Cross}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The syntax is a bit cryptic and uses the shorthand icons names we saw above. Here is what each part does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|Hillhead}}</code></strong> is a link to the Wkipedia article about this station</li>
  <li><strong><code>! !</code></strong> separates the text on the left from the icons</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+1</code></strong> is the first icon a light rail station in a tunnel that curves</li>
  <li><strong><code>\\</code></strong> adds in two empty icon-sized spaces</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+4</code></strong> adds in the second icon, similar to the last but towards top-left corner</li>
  <li><strong><code>\tSTRa</code></strong> adds in the third icon, a start of a stretch of tunnel</li>
  <li><strong><code>~~~</code></strong> separates the icons from the text on the right</li>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|St George's Cross}}</code></strong>  a link to the Wikipedia article about this station.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hundreds-of-thousands-of-icons">Hundreds of thousands of icons</h2>

<p>There are <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=File%3A+intitle%3A%22BSicon%22+intitle%3A%2FBSicon+.%2A%5C.svg%2F&amp;ns0=1&amp;ns6=1&amp;ns12=1&amp;ns14=1&amp;ns100=1&amp;ns106=1">more than 290,000 BSicons</a> out there due to an explosive number of combinations needed for different colours, rotations, intersections, bridges, curves, embankments and tunnels. Many obscure BSicons might only be used a few times across Wikipedia (like <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BSicon_BHFABZgl%2Bl.svg">BHFABZgl+l</a>)<sup><a href="#fn:triangle">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Each icon is simple, so simple many of them are marked as ineligible for copyright on Wikipedia. Together the icons can combine to map more complex systems.
Seeing how these icons can be combined inspired me to make a <strong><a href="https://mapmaker.chriszetter.com/">random BSicon map generator</a></strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been trying alternatives to Google services lately. No offense to Google. I just used their services uncritically for years. Now I want to evaluate them against their competitors. For example, <a href="https://www.bitlog.com/2020/03/06/duckduckgo-is-good-enough-for-regular-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now use DuckDuckGo instead of Google.</a></p>
<p>Basecamp released HEY recently. It is a privacy-focused email client that aims to give power back to the user. This sounded like something that I might appreciate. Every Gmail account I’ve owned uses a similar combination of features. Priority inbox, some specific settings that must be checked, a bunch of filters, etc. It’s always the result of iteration and resignation. It never feels quite right. It’s easy for me to believe that an email client could provide me a “wow” experience by encoding my workflow into the UI, and providing an “I’ve never known it before, but I’ve always wanted that!” moment.</p>
<p>I got a launch invite and decided to try it for a week.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase: HEY is a good email client, but it’s not a good fit for my relationship with email. I’m not going to pay for it. But this post isn’t a hit piece. Negativity is cheap and lazy. I’m going to explain the value that HEY provides. I will also explain why it wasn’t a good fit for me.</p>

<p>I forwarded my personal Gmail into my <a href="https://hey.com/">hey.com</a> account for one week. I got ~120 emails from ~80 senders. I only sent a handful of emails. This matches my personal email load for a typical week.</p>
<p>I kept a running Google Doc with notes. I especially wanted to split my negative notes into a few piles: bugs, dislikes, and mismatches.</p>
<p>I want to focus on mismatches in this post. When did HEY make me feel uncertain or afraid? When was I fighting it?</p>
<p>I’m not going to mention bugs. Do you really want to hear about a problem with using keyboard shortcuts to scroll through email? They probably fixed it before I published this post.</p>
<p>I’m not going to tell you about nitpicky choices that I didn’t like. This post would become a monument to my own change aversion. “The information density is too low! I can only see 9 emails on my laptop!” Jake. Chill. You’ll get used to it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I used HEY on a variety of platforms. I used the iOS client on my iPhone X. On desktop, I accessed it through Firefox on my 15″ Macbook Pro and my Windows gaming machine.</p>

I wore my mask for both.</figcaption></figure>

<p>I like HEY’s privacy stance. HEY explicitly blocks pixel trackers and loads images through a proxy. It will also “name and shame” companies that send emails with trackers by putting a special binoculars icon over the email.</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J4_gTcVhCBBrzFWcXv0bWMaRyeUOkgmeuhY5fWewv-wzvCf98oK3pt7eVzDpF2JZarDMRGDmTzaYV32i1hWmCcCJqyKgw4F_OLd4X8wwx7NW5Lk9HfFAU5A1W0upESqUtxVhi6hp" alt="An example showing a pixel tracker notification from Etsy"><figcaption><em>An example showing a pixel tracker notification</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some digital marketers don’t like this. Mailing list health is an important metric. If they can’t track open rates, then they can’t know how people are “progressing through the funnel” of reading their emails.</p>
<p>Fine by me. It’s hard to imagine receiving any benefit from telling a remote server, “psst, I opened your email.” I like that people can opt-out of ads with ad blockers. I also like that HEY focuses on opting-out of tracking pixels.</p>
<p>I didn’t care about the “name and shame” part of their pixel tracking. I’d be happy if they just had a counter saying “We stopped 531 tracking pixels this month.” I’m not interested in learning who sent an email with trackers. I just like that the filtering works.</p>

<p>HEY requires you to “screen in” every email recipient. When someone sends you an email for the first time, HEY shows a button asking you to “screen them in.” You will receive all future emails from them if you say “yes.” You will never get their email if you say “no.”</p>
<p>Do you receive a lot of unsolicited email? Promotional email you never read? Recruiter spam? Then you should seriously consider using HEY. Imagine saying “no thank you” to a spammy recruiter and never thinking about their emails again. Imagine the promotional emails never grabbing your attention. Imagine opening your email every day and only seeing the emails you want to see. That seems to be HEY’s vision, and I like it.</p>
<p>I interacted with the Screener a lot. I received email from ~80 different senders this week. I screened five of them out.</p>
<p>I don’t receive much unsolicited email. I aggressively unsubscribe from promotional mailers. I turn off email notifications that I don’t want. I sometimes delete services if I get too much email as a result of being a member. As a sidebar, deleting my LinkedIn account was a huge email quality-of-life improvement. The constant parade of recruiters dropped to manageable levels. You should consider it.</p>
<p>I spent lots of time considering some of the Screener decisions. I used to have a Netlify project that I have since deleted. I don’t need to receive email from them now. Maybe I should say “no” to a promotional email that they sent me. But what if I want to use Netlify in the future? I liked Netlify. I might use it again. Would my “no” still apply? I would be missing email that I need to receive. What if I lose my job in the recession and Netlify contacted me about a job opportunity? Would it be screened out? I had this kind of debate repeatedly throughout the week. Who is a sender? Is it a single email address? Is it a company? Is it an individual who could be represented by multiple email addresses? What about catch-all addresses like noreply? When can I safely reject email? I only felt safe using the Screener in a few narrow cases. In cases like Netlify, I screened them in and unsubscribed from the mailing list.</p>
<p>I’d like to make two caveats to this section. First: it seems that Gmail does not forward spam to HEY. I don’t know how good HEY’s spam filtering is and I don’t know how important the Screener would be in relation to it. Second: I only used HEY for a week. The Screener was a constant presence in the beginning. It appeared less as the week went on. I imagine that it wouldn’t appear much next week.</p>

<p>When you screen an email into HEY, you can choose one of three categorizations.</p>
<p>The primary location is the Imbox. This is the <strong>IM</strong>portant <strong>BOX</strong>. It’s an intentional spelling, and is designed as an inversion of an email inbox. The logic goes like this: Other people get to decide when stuff appears in your inbox. You need to intervene to stop it. On the other hand, something only appears in your IMbox when you declare it IMportant enough. This means that you have reclaimed power over the email that you receive.</p>
<p>This is also why HEY provides The Feed and Paper Trail. These represent common email types that you may not need to see right away. This is designed to further improve the Imbox experience by moving these emails out of sight until you want to see them.</p>
<p>The Feed is “The place for newsletters, marketing emails, or anything you want to casually browse.” I put a word-of-the-day email, some Google Alerts, and some newsletters into The Feed. Instead of acting like an email inbox, it is designed to be a content reader. You can periodically skim this content. But it’s not front-and-center in your Imbox.</p>
<p>Paper Trail is “The place for receipts, confirmations, and other transactional emails you receive.” I put automated notifications into here: online order confirmations, credit card purchase notifications, Twitch’s “this streamer is now online” notifications, etc.</p>
<p>After using the categorization for a week, it was clear that I struggled with both of them. I receive a daily newsletter with lengthy emails (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> by Matt Levine). It’s too big to read all at once during my workday. In practice, I sneak 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. When it’s in The Feed, this means that it was not an email. Instead it’s a card that is slowly being pushed down by other things in The Feed. The later in the day I started reading it, the harder it becomes to complete it 5 minutes at a time. Maybe I’d move this specific newsletter out of The Feed. There’s not much left at this point. I’d have to keep polling to find when the two or three remaining things ended up in The Feed. Everything might as well be in the Imbox.</p>
<p>I also regretted putting many of my emails into Paper Trail. When I buy something, I want to see the purchase receipt Right Now. I also receive credit card alerts for every purchase I make. This helps me identify recurring purchases that I no longer need. When these are in my inbox, I can read and clear the notification immediately. When things are in Paper Trail, they don’t seem to have “Unread” markers. You need to scrutinize timestamps and dates to figure out what might be new. If my Amazon order ships, I want to say “Cool” and then delete the notification. I definitely want to see it.</p>
<p>I fought against this workflow all week. HEY does a good job of explaining its categorization system. But I struggled to live in it. I really just wanted everything to appear in the Imbox. This is the same reason that I stopped using the “Multiple Inbox” feature in Gmail: I’d rather stop unwanted emails at their source, instead of moving it into a separate low-frequency box.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a good system that is a mismatch with my relationship with my emails. I don’t “casually browse” my newsletters, and I want to read all of my transaction receipts while my brain is still thinking about the purchase I just made.</p>

<p>There are other advanced features that I didn’t use, or used lightly.</p>
<p>Search worked well. I looked for a few things. I found what I was looking for.</p>
<p>HEY has a pair of features called “Reply Later” and “Reply Focus Mode.” This allows you to put off sending replies to emails. Later, you can enter a focused mode that allows you to reply to these specific emails without any UI distractions. I forwarded myself a few emails to put into here when I was experimenting with HEY, but I didn’t end up using the mode with any real seriousness. I don’t receive a ton of email in my personal account, so I don’t run into this problem much.</p>
<p>You can “Set aside” an email if you need to reference it. I can imagine needing this at work. If …</p></div></div>

<p>This Web site documents some moderately obscure computer graphics software history: a suite of animation products produced in the late 1980’s for the Atari ST personal computer platform. Although the fact is not widely known, this Atari software, published by a defunct computer magazine called Antic, directly preceded and led to the Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max products used by thousands of people today.</p>
<p>The articles herein basically comprise an oral history: the information is drawn from interviews and hands-on exploration of the software, running under emulation or on original equipment.</p>
<p>The site is organized into a chronological history, followed by in-depth discussions of each major product.</p>


<p>Thanks to my editor, Monica Smith, for making this documentation more respectable.</p>

<p>One of my little pet projects is a neurology book for psychologists, coaches and the like. What most people in these fields imagine about the brain is somewhere between perplexing, preposterous and potentially poisonous. (Seriously, I could tell you stories…) So I kind of wanted to write something like this for them.</p>
<p>Now I do consider it a tall order for me – I have some knowledge of neurology, but actually writing a SENSIBLE, understandable guidebook to neurology, with some practical applications too, that’s a challenge. (Senseless guidebooks to neurology are a dime a dozen, of course. In fact, I’ve walled in at least two people in one library, using only senseless pop-neurology books and as far I can tell, the rotting skeletons still haven’t been found. But then again the rotting corpse smell really doesn’t stand out much in most libraries I’ve been to, so I shouldn’t be surprised.)</p>
<p><a href="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg"><img src="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg 1920w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-610x407.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></p>
<p>But back to my main point. The great thing about trying to write a book like that, even attempting to prepare for doing it at one point in the future, when you know enough, is finding all the lovely little holes in how you’re telling the story to yourself. The teeny-tiny little jumps in understanding, the „lies-to-children”, the simplifications.</p>

<p>And one of these, for me, was how neurons get to connect.</p>

<p>And when I asked around, it turned out I wasn’t the only one missing this little bit.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, we all know Hebb. „Neurons that fire together, wire together”, the neurology mantra in flesh. I can just imagine NeuroZen masters, walking around meditating neurologists, „fiiiiiiiiireeee toooooogeeeether” instead of „ommmm” going around.</p>

<p>That’s how neurons connect. When two fire at once, their connection becomes stronger. The synapse gains long term potentiation/LTP, by both an increase in the neurotransmitters produced, and an increase in the postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitters. Short-term it happens through utilizing some of the additional AMPA receptors available near to the synaptic membrane in the postsynaptic cell, long term by changes in protein synthesis and gene expression, in order to ensure a larger number of receptors. So far so good, in one way or another pretty much anyone who understands anything about neurology understands this bit. It might be more or less simplistic, you might have the AMPA receptors memorized or not, but you get the gist of it.&nbsp;(Although this begs the question: does Dale’s principle means that the increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter production influence not just this single synapse, but also the concentration of neurotransmitters in all synaptic connections of the presynaptic neuron? Or perhaps does a reverse mechanism happen, with other connections of the presynaptic neuron being stripped bare of their neurotransmitters? Something I need to check! )</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: how do neurons that AREN’T already connected connect? How does their “fire/wire” rule go?</p>

<p>I mean, that still applies, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Actually, it doesn’t apply in the original Hebb’s law, since that required the neurons to be connected already and a couple of other things as well. But still, the general principle is how we tend to explain things like associative learning, conditioning, etc. The direct wording of Hebb’s law can’t apply there, because then we’d need every neural network to be connected to every other neural network at once, and that’d be a mess that wouldn’t really work all that well. But the general principle seems to apply.</p>

<p>And when I started asking around, no one could tell me how exactly.</p>

<p>How does a neuron know to extend new axonal or dendric connections towards another neuron, so that they might actually form a synapse between the two? Because this has to happen somehow, and this has to happen in a fairly structured way. If it didn’t happen, if we were only left to the remains of the synaptic pruning we got since birth, then our neural networks would become pretty much immovable after were what, twelve? I mean yeah, I’ve met these people, and so have you, but they’re in the small minority… well, large minority… well, OK, a small majority. But even so, there are quite a few people who aren’t that way. And if the neural growth was haphazard, then we’d get a far more random jumble of associations, then the fairly clean ones we tend to get in any conditioning/associative learning experiences.</p>

<p>So I knew there must be some kind of system for neurons to detect other neurons it should be „aiming for” in their development.</p>

<p>And – this was about two or three years ago as of writing this – no one I asked could tell me what it was. I’ve reached out to a lot of people I’ve considered very competent in the field, including some of my old Uni professors, and no one could direct me. Nor could I find the answer in any of the textbooks I’ve referred to.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the answer is fairly recent, as articles about it only started to appear in the 2000s. Since it took me some time to find it back then, I figured I’d make this article to share it now, making the whole thing easier to find for others.</p>

<p>We’ve known from about 1890 that the endings of both the axon and the dendrites are covered in something known as a growth cone. Like the tip of the branch, this is the part where the cell can further develop and extend, either in original growth, in regeneration, or as a reaction to some factors (including a decrease in overall electric activity which causes a form of synaptic scaling – hence explaining the „devouring” of unused neural pathways of amputated body parts by nearby active structures). But how do the growth cones know how exactly to grow? The brain is a complex three-dimensional web of interconnected neurons, so „hitting” the right point is definitely too hard if the neurons just kept on growing until they hit anything at all.</p>

<p>Now, the synaptic scaling process is still a piece of the answer – even if a neuron forms a new synaptic connection with a different neuron, if the target neuron already has too many connections, it will tend to remove the weakest ones, and this includes the most recent ones. The scaling goes both ways after all – it goes for more synapses when it starts with too few, but for less, if it starts with too many.</p>

<p>But synaptic scaling is not everything. As it turns out, the tips of the growth cone constantly produce structures called filopodia, and these react to specific chemical attractants and repellents. These chemicals are produced by both cells at the target area, and by so-called guidepost cells along the way. There are suggestions that the system for such targeting is fairly robust, especially in early development (and its limitations in later life might explain why spinal cord injuries and the like are so hard to fix).</p>

<p>(There is one other process for directing cells, the growth along the radial glia, but since it mainly refers to embryonic development, it’s really not all that interesting for us in this topic.)</p>

<p>Now, the more perceptive of you will already have noticed that while what I’ve given is AN answer, it is not THE answer to the question I’ve originally asked. Or at least, not necessarily.</p>

<p>It might be possible, that the interaction of the three systems:<br>– a pre-set network of attractor/repellent chemical pathways for guiding axon/dendrite growth,<br>– the synaptic scaling mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, which limits the max connections and promotes new connections if existing neural excitability falls below what is the baseline for the network,<br>– and the good old Hebbian mechanism for strengthening existing neural connections,<br>is in fact enough. That the interplay of these systems does answer our basic question, and simple enough rules result in sufficient flexibility to explain what is observed.</p>

<p>But, obviously, the process might be a bit more complicated. There isn’t that much literature about it, unfortunately, so what I’m doing here is more of an (un)educated guess, but since guidepost cells tend to be neurons which have yet to develop an axon – but already have dendrites and can receive signals, a slightly more complex – but better targeted – system can be imagined, where guidepost cells would be a part of a wider neural network, the stimulation of which „calls forth” further cells to build connections. This, in my understanding (Again, limited, so don’t take my word for it. I mean it.) would be a more effective explanation of how we can rapidly learn to connect fairly new information, even across huge (neurologically-scaled) swaths of neural space. A strongly agitated system produces a stronger „call for connections”, hence mediating the faster development of new and broader associations.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a quick summary of one part of neural connectivity I’ve yet to see described in a textbook about the brain, but which really should be given out there, along with the classic Hebbian principle. Hope it’s useful 🙂</p>

<p>Two years ago, on June 4th of 2018, Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, unicorn darling of the developer tools startup ecosystem, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">for $7.5B in stock</a>. The announcement unearthed a wide range of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17221527" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinions and pontifications</a>, ranging from “GitHub is doomed” to “Microsoft is smart”, with many predictions about GitHub’s future. Some thought Microsoft’s growing investments in its cloud offering, Azure, might help GitHub. Could an investment by Microsoft improve GitHub’s reliability or harden them against outages like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDOSes</a>? Have any of these predictions come true?</p>



<p>We set out to analyze one angle of the GitHub acquisition: Has GitHub become more reliable since its acquisition by Microsoft? Our service, <a href="https://statusgator.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">StatusGator</a>, monitors more than 700 status pages of cloud providers and SaaS companies large and small. We aggregate and normalize status page data and make it available to our subscribers however they need: in notifications by email, Slack, Teams, or webhook, and in a <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/01/24/how-to-save-precious-minutes-during-incident-response/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">unified status dashboard</a> for all service dependencies.</p>

<p>For more than 5 years, we have analyzed the <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub status page</a> constantly. Every 5 minutes, StatusGator takes a screenshot and <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/github" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">collects relevant data</a> about their service status. That means we are uniquely positioned to offer analysis of the downtime that GitHub themselves announce via their status page.</p>



<p>What does the data tell us? In the two years since the acquisition announcement, GitHub has reported a 41% increase in status page incidents. Furthermore, there has been a 97% increase in incident minutes, compared to the two years prior to the announcement. Does this actually point to a decrease in reliability? We can’t say. This could simply mean GitHub has increased its transparency, publishing to their status page more frequently.</p>



<h2>Incident Counts</h2>



<p>We calculated an incident count in the 24 months preceding the announcement and the 24 months after. We <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/26/under-the-hood-inside-a-status-page-aggregator/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">classify status pages</a> into four states: <em>up</em>, <em>warn</em>, and <em>down</em>, and <em>maintenance</em>. GitHub does not expose scheduled maintenance on their status page. For these calculations we consider an incident to be any change in status between <em>up</em> and <em>warn</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>



<p>Before the acquisition, there were 89 incidents published on the GitHub status page. After, there were 126 incidents. A 41% increase:</p>

<p>In the graph below, we’ve charted the incident counts by month. The left side shows the 24 months before and the right side shows the 24 months after:</p>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png" alt="Graph showing GitHub incidents by month, before and after their acquisition by Microsoft." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1024x533.png 1024w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-300x156.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-768x400.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-1536x799.png 1536w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-720x375.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-580x302.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph-320x167.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-downtime-incident-graph.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<h2>Incident Minutes</h2>



<p>We calculated incident minutes by subtracting the start and end time of time of incidents. Although not 100% realtime, StatusGator checks frequently: every 5 minutes, so status page changes are detected quickly. We counted time where the page was not in an overall <em>up</em> state.</p>



<p>In the 24 months prior to the acquisition announcement, there were 6,110 minutes of downtime. During the 24 months after, there were 12,074 minutes of downtime, a 97% increase:</p>

<h2>Status Page Evolution</h2>



<p>During these four years, GitHub has made enormous improvements in their status page information granularity and design. In December 2018, they switched from a home grown status page to one operated by Atlassian’s StatusPage service, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/03/11/2019-statusgator-status-page-awards/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">the most popular status page provider</a>. In doing so, they added numerous <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/11/22/component-status-filtering-is-here/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">individual component statuses</a>. Here’s what GitHub’s status page looked like before their switch to Atlassian StatusPage:</p>



<h3>GitHub’s Old Status Page</h3>

<p>When they switched to their new status page format, GitHub took a huge step towards increased accountability and transparency by detailing the following individual service components:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Issues, PRs, Dashboard, Projects</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Gists</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<p>Overtime, they have expanded and refined their component statuses. They also started showing historical data right on their status page. As you can see in their newest and most detailed status page format, it shows the following service component statuses:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Issues, PRs, Projects</li><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitHub Packages</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<h3>GitHub’s New Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png" alt="GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png 944w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-277x300.png 277w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-768x833.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-720x781.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-580x629.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-320x347.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service.</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also moved their status page to a dedicated domain, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">githubstatus.com</a>, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">which follows a best practice we recommend</a> to anyone who hosts a status page. All of this additional transparency, details, and historical data is a commendable effort to relay the most up-to-date information about the status of all GitHub systems. More providers of critical cloud infrastructure should emulate what GitHub has done. <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/07/your-status-page-is-useless-if-you-dont-use-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Your status page is useless if you don’t use it.</a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What can we conclude from all of this data? Objectively, we can conclude that GitHub has published to their status page more frequently in the two years after their acquisition announcement. They have posted more incidents of disruption and downtime. Those incidents have been longer in duration. According to the data they provided, GitHub has been down more since the acquisition by Microsoft. </p>



<p>But that could be all a part of coordinated effort to be more transparent about their service status, an effort that should be applauded.</p>



<p>Our goal at StatusGator is not to shame anyone for disruptions and outages. Everyone experiences unexpected downtime. We simply strive to make status page data available and accessible in more useful ways. From Slack and <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/03/status-page-monitoring-in-microsoft-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Microsoft Teams</a>, to <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/30/status-page-webhooks-new-and-improved/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">webhooks</a>, an API, and more. StatusGator aggregates status page data and empowers you to keep your team informed. </p>

<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>

<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>
<figure>

<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>A program is not a very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Software operates on different plane when compared to pen-and-paper business. It is the duty of software developer to avoid the trap of aligning software with principles of a traditional business.</p>
<p>In this article, we will describe how the fast pencil fallacy becomes reality in a common software development project. After that, we will explain how that fallacy can be avoided.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>To better understand how brand-new software inadvertently becomes a fast pencil, we need to understand the process of delivering software. It all begins with the customer, probably feeling lost in the process of defining requirements – desires if you will – specifying what the future product should and should not do.</p>
<p>The customer is running a business, in a way which has remained the same for a hundred years maybe. They are using very primitive tools, quite different from the tools we use in software development. They are accustomed to using a pencil.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image1.png" alt="image1.png"></p><p>And what they ask a software developer to do, is to come up with a nice and square software to enhance the way their business is run. And indeed, developer comes up with a piece of software, which is meant to replace that traditional pen-and-paper business. That is the moment when magic happens in its least desired form, because the customer, no matter how hard they tried, will never be able to see the difference between the two, the pencil and the software.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image2.png" alt="image2.png"></p><p>They will normally see the program as a very fast pencil. They will invariantly look at the program as a fast replacement for their traditional business. And that is the problem. Modern software development practices based on accepting customer’s requirements and implementing them to the point where any distinction between software and a pencil disappears is the root cause of bad software design.</p>
<p>If you try to oversee software development today, you will see programs of all kinds working exactly the same as the pen-and-paper business they are addressing, with only one tiny distinction, and that is that software is automated to a degree. That is precisely why customers will keep seeing software as their very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Do you want to develop that? No, you don’t! But what will you do instead? How will you respond to customer’s requirements? To answer these questions, we need to return to place where it all begins: To the bare business.</p>
<p>Spoiler ahead. When developing software, we will not regard customer as the source of truth. Not everything your customer will tell is correct. We will now look at software development from a different perspective.</p>
<h2>Avoiding the Fallacy</h2>
<p>To understand how software should be developed, we will once again start from the customer, who is utterly lost with so many thoughts in their head. They have a business, that’s the fact. But that is not relevant to software development, because nobody wants to have a business. People want to have a vacation, not a business. Something else they have is of our interest instead, which remains to be discovered.</p>
<p>In software development, voyage begins with understanding that customer, who owns the business, has something else of importance. That will probably be the element you have never met in your programming life. They, customers, have the problem. They have something that is hurting them, or hurting their own customers.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image3.png" alt="image3.png"></p><p>Their entire business is built around methods of addressing that problem. That is the whole point of businesses, and the reason why it was said above that nobody wants to have a business. Customers want to solve the problem for their own customers and to make money by being successful at it.</p>
<p>Where does the software fit into this picture, then? Software comes as a representation of a solution to the problem. You would move the problem away from the customer and put software in between. That makes software a layer of abstraction between the user and the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, we are switching to term user, not customer anymore. Basically, user is the one who is using software, and customer is the one who is paying for the software to be developed. This definition may not cover all angles, but it will be sufficient to understand the explanations that follow.</p>
<p>When put that way, users will use the software, and software will abstract away that pointy thing below which is hurting them. The rule of the game is to remove the problem from user’s view, and to replace it with an abstract representation of the problem, so that software can act as an automated solution to the problem instance.</p>
<p>Finally, there comes the question of avoiding the fast pencil fallacy. You will avoid it best if you understand that software itself is of no interest to the user. What is of interest, however, is the way the user will send commands to software. That is how user is controlling the abstraction of the problem. You will need to think about how to best implement commands, then.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image4.png" alt="image4.png"></p><p>Software will ultimately produce one tiny item, and that is the only thing your user will ever care about. That is the output, the product of applying software.</p>
<p>In effect, the user will only be concerned with giving commands to software and collecting the result. And even those commands will be of little concern, with that result of applying software remaining the only thing that is useful to the user. Software is not important. Problem is not important. Output is the only thing that counts.</p>
<p>Software developer will effectively switch to thinking how to let somebody apply the program to produce output. In that way, all that lies below a very thin line under the user interface becomes the developer’s own problem, rather than being the customer’s problem. The customer will see none of the elements below the surface and they will forever remain the software developer’s domain of business.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image5.png" alt="image5.png"></p><h2>Software as a Useful Tool</h2>
<p>From a broader perspective, to develop a working software means to develop the inner parts in such way that outer parts, the user interface, can operate and let the user produce the desired output.</p>
<p>All business processes remain the duty of the software to perform. Software will not expect the user to navigate through processes and effectively run them manually. Instead, software will expect the user to fill in the required information so that the processes can be executed on their own.</p>
<p>If you were successful doing that, your software will not be a very fast pencil. It will turn the tables and do the right thing (whatever that is) to solve the problem for the user.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we have shed light on one of the most prominent issues in software development – the problem of understanding what customer needs, as opposed to accepting what the customer is asking for.</p>
<p>When we scratch under the surface, we find great uncertainty in customers’ views, which comes from misunderstanding the role of software, and the working principles of machines if you like.</p>
<p>Customers need guidance to the realm of software. Developers need to interview customers to understand the problem the business is solving, not just the current working principles of the business itself.</p>
<p>Once understanding of the problem is established, the duty of software developer is to produce abstract model of the problem and implement processes upon it. The result should be the software product, which is performing business processes in fully automated fashion, so that the user doesn’t have to perform them manually.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This is a (very late) reply to Patrick McKenzie's "<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</a>". I find much of his advice very sensible, and it might be very helpful to someone in the beginning of their career – assuming they can act upon it (and I really don't know whether my 20-year-old self could actually use the advice to improve his negotiation skills, for example).</p>
<p>A few things in the article I disagree with, however. Here I'll mostly focus on those few things, recommending you to read the original article so that you don't miss the rest of it.</p>
<p>"Disagree" is not necessarily the right word – a more precise way to put it would be "it's different in my experience". Which is to be expected because both of us are speaking based on our own careers, which have been rather different. Patrick McKenzie is a small business owner running <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/">Bingo Card Creator</a> and a successful consultant. I'm a lead chip architect at a billion-dollar company. Both of us have thus traveled some distance away from "purely programming" (whatever that means), but in rather different directions.</p>
<p><strong>What company are you going to work for?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie says 90% of the jobs involve things like implementing an internal travel expense reporting form, rather than a product shipped to external customers. He advises you to get used to the idea, even though such software is "soul-crushingly boring" as he puts it.</p>
<p>How bad is it, and is it really 90% of the jobs? Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">thinks</a> it's maybe 80% – and that it's bad enough to "drain the life out of you". He goes on to elaborate why it "sucks to be an in-house programmer":</p>
<ul>
<li>There's rarely a business reason to improve in-house software past the point of "barely good enough". "Forget any pride of craftsmanship – you're going to churn out embarrassing junk".</li>
<li>At software companies, what you do is more directly related to the way the company makes money, so you're more likely to be respected. "A programmer is never going to rise to become CEO of Viacom, but you might well rise to become CEO of a tech company." "…no matter how critical it was for Viacom to get this internet thing  right, when it came time to assign people to desks, the in-house  programmers were stuck with 3 people per cubicle in a dark part of the  office".</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that McKenzie and Spolsky are in almost complete agreement over these points. But then Spolsky says you should be gunning for a position in a software company – the environment where creatures of your kind naturally thrive. Conversely, McKenzie explains how to prosper as a programmer outside software companies – <em>moving in the opposite direction of where things go by default</em> (being stuck in a dark part of the office while they're trying to outsource your job.)</p>
<p>So the question is which path you prefer. "Not so fast", you say: one of these jobs is way easier to land – 80-90% of the chances are you're not getting inside a software company – so it's not just a question of preference.</p>
<p>Here I disagree: even if only 10-20% of programmers work in software companies (where are the stats?..), and even if they're "the best" (according to what metric?), McKenzie himself says in that same article:</p>
<blockquote><p>You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with:&nbsp; Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if competition is relatively unskilled on average, you probably can land a job in the 10-20% of the sector that you want – as did most people who graduated around the time I did. So I rather firmly believe that it's a matter of choice: do you <em>want</em> to work on in-house software or one-off businessy projects of that kind, or do you prefer a software company?</p>
<p>Let's proceed to McKenzie's advice to in-house programmers – which should in itself help one make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>How to call yourself<br>
</strong></p>
<p>One such advice is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't call yourself a programmer. “Programmer” sounds like “anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.” Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure – an in-house programmer is likely doing some type of expensive mumbo-jumbo in the eyes of his non-technical MBA-wielding manager.</p>
<p>To me, however, a programmer is who I'm looking for, while a resume full of revenue increases and cost reductions sounds like an "anomalously high-cost parasite who types some mumbo-jumbo into Excel and PowerPoint, claiming credit for others' work".</p>
<p>McKenzie says a software company looks at this just like a company hiring internal programmers, essentially. His example is "the guy who wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google’s revenue passes through – he’s now an angel investor". The guy apparently got rich by being near a "profit center" rather than through his unusual skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, in this case I believe he's talking about <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/">Ron Garret</a>, the PhD from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Do you think they hired him because he described his work at the JPL in terms of revenues and costs? (BTW he didn't like working on the billing code, bought his stock options and quit, instead of choosing a career at the company's biggest "profit center".)</p>
<p>Did any unusual skills go into the billing code? Ron Garret <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/xooglers.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did end up writing the credit card billing and accounting system, which is a nontrivial thing to get right. Fortunately for me, just before coming to Google I had taken some time to study computer security and cryptography, so I was actually well prepared for that particular task. …I designed the billing system to be secure against even a dishonest employee with root access (which is not such an easy thing to do). I have no idea if they are still using my system, but if they are then I'd feel pretty confident that my credit card number was not going to get stolen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me that his technical knowledge and programming ability was the bulk of his contribution, whereas deep thoughts such as realizing that there will be some "cost reduction" due to not having credit card numbers stolen is not something an employer needs to hire anyone for.</p>
<p>So if I ever send out a resume as a chip architect, I will focus on my technical role in transitioning from fixed-function hardware accelerators to programmable processors, more than the manpower this saved and the business we won as a result (which I think were real outcomes of our work, but which is rather hard to quantify – as these things often are unless you're a business-friendly-sounding liar.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure <em>when </em>I'll send out that resume, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>On job hopping, backstabbing, and the lack thereof </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Co-workers and bosses are not usually your friends: You will spend a lot of time with co-workers.&nbsp; You may eventually become close friends with some of them, but in general, you will move on in three years…</p>
<p>&lt;your boss will&gt; attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever do,  like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or  guilt-trip you into spending more time with the company when you could  be spending time with your actual friends. &nbsp;You will have other  coworkers who — affably and ethically — will suggest things which go  against your interests…</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a certain internal consistency to a view that your coworkers are not your friends, because you will move on in 3 years. In fact, it's a bit circular. They aren't your friends – because you'll move on. And why will you move on? Well, I dunno, maybe for a 10% salary increase. What's there to lose? Relationships with coworkers? But coworkers aren't your friends!</p>
<p>Again, I don't disagree, but rather offer an alternative view, equally internally consistent. I have stayed at one job for more than a decade, in large part because I'm rather attached to the people I work with. To be sure, I got raises, and I was ready to quit over employment terms – but it'd take much more than 10%.</p>
<p>Isn't it just a quantitative difference in preferences – a 10% raise not being fundamentally different than, say, 100%? Well, sufficiently large quantitative changes add up to qualitative changes, as Marxian dialectics or some other Soviet philosophy thingie that my parents sometimes quote taught us. What's going on is that both approaches can lead to career advancement, but they do so very differently.</p>
<p>If you're willing to change jobs over a small raise, you'll be changing them frequently. You won't get attached to people, or to the work you're doing together. You will be very good at finding jobs and you will know what's generally going on in the industry and what's in demand. You will <em>not </em>know that many things specific to any of your employers. <em>You and your employer will become very useful to each other fairly quickly, but you'll also be somewhat expendable for each other.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can keep a job as long as it's a fun environment, requiring a significant raise once in a while. Your relationships with people combined with your long-term outlook can let you do things together that you otherwise couldn't plan or execute, and learn things you wouldn't have learned.</p>
<p>Much of my knowledge about chip design comes from ASIC hackers I worked with, and their willingness to develop their biggest ideas together with me came from trust that necessarily took time to build. It takes time to learn that none of you is in the habit of "suggesting things going against the other's interest", or pulling other unfriendly shenanigans.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you stay at one place for a long while, then your worth to the employer grows to the point where you can get the significant raise that you'd quit over without actually quitting. Your worth can also grow well above what employers are willing to pay to experienced new hires, so there's no longer a point in switching jobs. This is somewhat analogous to becoming a consultant after having switched a …</p></div></div>

      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"runtime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"application"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"testLogality"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"file_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/test/spec/surface.test.js"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"hostname"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"pid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>36255</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"process_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node ."</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<h2 id="custom-output-and-pretty-print">Custom Output and Pretty Print</h2>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/logality-lifecycle-outline.svg" alt="Logality Lifecycle Outline"></p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cross-compiling self-contained Java desktop application launchers.</p><h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2><p>Java’s promise of <em>write once, run anywhere</em> still resonates with me, perhaps because I cut my teeth on JDK 1.0.2b. It was amazing to write cross-platform networking applications without concern for variations in POSIX implementations, or having to worry about nuances between C compilers, or even needing to grok <code>htons</code>. Someone else could wrestle with <code>#ifdef</code>s, shielding others by high-level, standard abstractions. Although Smalltalk had concocted platform-independence punch in 1983, it wasn’t until 1996 that Java’s virtual machine (VM) and subsequent OEM distributions made drinking the mantra of cross-platform development an easy reality.</p><p>Strategically—and selfishly—Microsoft smote that future with a sledgehammer: it moved to <em>embrace and extend</em> Java to achieve vendor lock-in, splintering the platform.</p><p>Developers can no longer rely on systems having a Java VM available. This implies that end-users must download (and install) two independent programs: a suitable VM and a Java archive. It also means that developers now have choices ahead of them that were once bygone worries. Choices that burden end-users and developers alike. Asking people to download a VM for their operating system and CPU architecture is a barrier to product adoption. What’s worse is that some VMs now support “full” Java while others don’t support JavaFX modules at all.</p><p>We’ll address that last point later.</p><p>In late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/kevinrushforth">Kevin Rushforth</a>, of Oracle’s Java Team, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZGW9AalZLN4?t=504">presented</a> a solution to the packaging problem: <code>jpackage</code> and <code>jlink</code>. During the presentation he listed some of the tooling’s shortcomings, which include:</p><ul><li>No cross-platform deployment</li><li>No cross-compilation (must run on MacOS to produce <code>.dmg</code>)</li></ul><p>Let’s not mince words: Java developers could once build applications on their preferred operating system and deploy anywhere; now, they must build installers for every individual platform they intend to target on those very systems.</p><p>Was that the <em>punch-line</em> to a two-decade lead up?</p><p>Requiring developers to have at least two commercial operating systems (Windows, MacOS X), even if emulated inside of a virtualized container—as opposed to using physical hardware—for a platform-independent programming language is an ironic barrier to entry. <em>Especially</em> for people bereft of bankroll.</p><p>Yes, those tools—alongside modules—help produce minimal executables. Who cares? What they don’t do is make it possible to create a set of native, standalone launcher binaries from a single build machine. Let’s fix that by pouring over the big splashes of how to cross-compile application launchers for Java on one build machine. We’ll use Linux because it’s free.</p><h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2><p>You will need:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dgiagio/warp">Warp Packer</a>, a tool for building native application launchers</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a source code management tool</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, a tool for fetching files</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> version 6.4.1, a build system</li><li><a href="https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/2020/06/29/write-once-build-anywhere/build-template">build-template</a>, my own starter shell script (MIT licensed)</li></ul><p>Install <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code> using the package manager for your Linux distro.</p><h3 id="install-warp-packer">Install Warp Packer</h3><p>The installation instructions for Warp Packer are a bit buried. Install the software on a Linux system as follows (change the version number to suit):</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
wget -O warp-packer \
  https://github.com/dgiagio/warp/releases/download/v0.3.0/linux-x64.warp-packer
chmod +x warp-packer</code></pre><p>If needed, include <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable by adding the following line to <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>:</p><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"</code></pre><p>Apply the new environment settings by opening a new terminal or <code>source</code>’ing the <code>.bashrc</code> file directly.</p><p>Warp Packer is installed.</p><h3 id="install-build-template">Install Build Template</h3><p>Copy, move, or download <code>build-template</code> into <code>$HOME/bin</code>.</p><p>The build template is installed.</p><h2 id="javafx">JavaFX</h2><p>Before we get into building a Java application, a little more history is warranted. Originally, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) came bundled with Java, for the same reasons that having a bundled networking API was useful. The AWT lacked aesthetic, both in appearance and as a library. Swing, the AWT’s successor, made strides to address both, but fell short. JavaFX, which was also initially bundled with Java (versions 8 to 10), is a modern graphical user interface (GUI) library for developing desktop applications, as well as a superb replacement for Swing.</p><p>It has been argued that JavaFX should never have been bundled with Java. Nevertheless, the decision to un-bundle JavaFX from Java 11 onwards has led to Java projects that will be stuck with old Java versions for years to come—possibly leading to their abandonment—because it takes <em>a lot</em> of effort to migrate a build process to support these new, un-bundled Java Development Kits (JDKs).</p><p>Part of that effort entails re-bundling JavaFX. There are a few ways this can be accomplished:</p><ul><li>Create a single <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/59087">überjar</a></em> that contains native libraries for all intended platform targets.</li><li>Create separate <em>überjars</em>, with each JAR containing native libraries specific to its target platform.</li></ul><p>It’s almost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice">Hobson’s choice</a> because we have to create launcher binaries for each target platform anyway. Meaning bundling all of the target platform libraries into each native launcher is wasteful; however, bundling them in a single JAR file for those who have a Java VM installed already may be somewhat useful.</p><p>Java has introduced the concept of modules, looking to simplify the build process. Sometimes, though, modules cannot be included because of outdated dependencies. Problems can arise when running <code>jlink</code> against old dependencies. Compounding the issue is when the projects have been sundowned or have long release schedules. Nevertheless, for our purposes, we’ll want to download a version of OpenJDK that supports JavaFX.</p><p>With that background in mind, let’s go cross-compile some binaries.</p><h2 id="java-application">Java Application</h2><p>We’ll create native application launchers for <a href="https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/">Scrivenvar</a>, a JavaFX-based text editor that I’ve been developing.</p><p>Dive in by cloning the latest version as follows:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar.git
cd scrivenvar</code></pre><p>The application is downloaded.</p><h2 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h2><p>Let’s review the scripts that help build the application, which include:</p><ul><li><code>build.gradle</code> — builds application Java Archive (JAR) files</li><li><code>installer</code> — builds native, standalone binaries</li></ul><p>Separating the <code>installer</code> script’s responsibilities from <code>build.gradle</code> is not necessary, technically. When running third-party executables (e.g., <code>warp-packer</code>), my first inclination is to use a shell script, rather than gradle’s <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The <code>installer</code> script invokes <code>gradle</code> when requested.</p><h2 id="gradle-script">Gradle Script</h2><p>Open up <code>build.gradle</code> to review a few pertinent code blocks.</p><h3 id="target-operating-system">Target Operating System</h3><p>The first snippet determines what native JavaFX libraries (i.e., target platform code) to include within the JAR file:</p><pre><code>String[] os = ["win", "mac", "linux"]

if (project.hasProperty('targetOs')) {
  if ("windows".equals(targetOs)) {
    os = ["win"]
  }
  else {
    os = [targetOs]
  }
}</code></pre><p>Unless instructed otherwise, the build script will create a JAR file that includes JavaFX binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS embedded. We can target a specific platform by using the <code>-P</code> command line option when building, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build jar -PtargetOs=linux</code></pre><p>There’s a catch here in that <code>win</code> and <code>windows</code> are different names. The <code>installer</code> script needs to use <code>windows</code> because that’s part of the JDK file name being downloaded. Arguably, we could move that logic into the <code>installer</code> script, but the point is that the JDK filename and JavaFX refer to Windows using different terminology. The difference must be captured somwhere.</p><h3 id="javafx-dependencies">JavaFX Dependencies</h3><p>The second snippet tells the build system to include JavaFX for a given set of operating systems, as follows:</p><pre><code>def fx = ['controls', 'graphics', 'fxml', 'swing']

fx.each { fxitem -&gt;
  os.each { ositem -&gt;
    runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:javafx-${fxitem}:${javafx.version}:${ositem}"
  }
}</code></pre><p>The application uses JavaFX controls, graphics, fxml, and notice that it also lists a JavaFX-Swing integration. Using <code>.each</code> is a tidy way of not having to maintain a list of JavaFX-specific imports for each operating system, should either or both need to change.</p><h3 id="javafx-exclusions">JavaFX Exclusions</h3><p>Of lesser importance are exclude groups:</p><pre><code>implementation('de.jensd:fontawesomefx-fontawesome:4.7.0-11') {
  exclude group: 'org.openjfx'
}</code></pre><p>Without excluding JavaFX from certain JavaFX-related dependencies, the build will fail. Unfortunately, the build fails in such a way that the developer must investigate what package caused the conflict. Ideally, the build failure would pinpoint any collisions for the developer.</p><h3 id="run-application">Run Application</h3><p>The last point of note are the following lines:</p><pre><code>applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED",
]</code></pre><p>These lines address permissions issues encountered when running the application using gradle, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build run</code></pre><p>Now that we understand how this build script works, let’s move on to the <code>installer</code> shell script.</p><h2 id="installer-script">Installer Script</h2><p>Looking at the big picture, the <code>installer</code> script performs the following steps to create a native launcher binary:</p><ol type="1"><li>Configure platform-specific parameters for extraction.</li><li>Rebuild the <em>überjar</em> for the target platform.</li><li>Clean out the distribution directory for a fresh build.</li><li>Extract the target JDK into the distribution directory.</li><li>Create a platform-dependent launch script to run the application.</li><li>Copy the <em>überjar</em> into the distribution directory.</li><li>Wrap the distribution into a standalone binary.</li></ol><p>These high-level steps can be found in the <code>execute()</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the script works.</p><h3 id="build-template">Build Template</h3><p>The <code>build-template</code> script is described in depth in the first three parts of my Typesetting Markdown series. We reuse the script here because it simplifies writing user-friendly shell scripts.</p><p>Downloading and extracting a requisite JDK is pivotal. JDKs can be downloaded from a few places, but most of them have …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>When casting from YouTube to a Chromecast, sometimes the audio playback will <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879?hl=en">skip</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17251626?hl=en">stutter</a>. This issue is independent of the quality of the video, the FPS, or the internet connection. Trying to watch certain videos will reliably cause playback issues on the Chromecast.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879">this thread</a>, the playback issue only appeared in the latest and final firmware update for the Chromecast. Successful playback of the videos was possible in the past, and casting the downloaded YouTube videos eliminates the problem entirely. The problem exists solely when casting certain videos using the YouTube app.</p>  <p>Given that the problem only occurs with the YouTube app, you can download a video and cast it via <a href="https://github.com/xat/castnow"><code>castnow</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt"><code>catt</code></a>, skipping the YouTube app entirely.</p> <p>You could do something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"</span>

<span>function </span>cast<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    youtube-dl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span># wait a bit to download the file</span>
    castnow <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

cast <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But having to skip using the YouTube app to cast is already a clunky solution, and downloading every video before playing them is an even worse user experience. Instant playback and ephemeral streams are what make for a pleasant video streaming experience in 2020, and this solution implements neither of them</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">Since <code>youtube-dl</code> allows us to output to <code>stdout</code></a>, if we can hook its <code>stdout</code> to a casting app, we could emulate the instant playback and ephemeral videos we expect because we don’t have to wait for an entire file to download.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <code>castnow</code> and <code>catt</code> won’t cast from <code>stdin</code>. You’re expected to pass it file locations to cast from.</p> <p>This is where one of my favorite shell features really shines: <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">process substitution</a>.</p> <p>With process substitution, Bash gives us a convenient way to make ephemeral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe">anonymous pipes</a>. This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout</span> <span>'#chromecast'</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout-chromecast-ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$ip</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--demux-filter</span><span>=</span>demux_chromecast <span>\</span>
      <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &lt; /dev/tty
<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That works.</p> <p>As an aside, we hook VLC’s <code>stdin</code> to <code>/dev/tty</code> so that we can use the ncurses interface even if we invoke the function from a script.</p> <p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/ncurses/">ncurses interface</a>.</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d0822203c304db88f3cbec618e94a3d9f55cd269/c5939/assets/imgs/converted/vlc-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div> <p>It only displays the file descriptor, and very little about the video itself. I’m not a fan of that.</p>  <p>Instead of using anonymous pipes, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipes</a>. Named pipes are like anonymous pipes, except they are not anonymous (they have a name) nor are they ephemeral. Named pipes still give us the efficiency and concurrency benefits that anonymous pipes give us, but Bash lacks the syntactic sugar it has for process substitution when it comes to named pipes.</p> <p>This is how we create named pipes, write to them, read from them and remove them.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkfifo </span>ourpipe

</code></pre></div></div> <p>This works, too.</p> <p>We need to manually create a named pipe with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/mkfifo"><code>mkfifo</code></a>, redirect <code>youtube-dl</code>’s <code>stdout</code> to the named pipe while running the process in the background, and then cleanup the process after casting from it via VLC, otherwise it might linger in the background. Each of those tasks would have been handled for us automatically using process substitution.</p> <p>But it does look a bit better:</p> <div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/25d68fb2085191adb26bb931e9bb31c638e5a634/f664c/assets/imgs/converted/vlc3-fs8.webp" loading="lazy"> </p> </div>  <p>Pipes, anonymous pipes and named pipes are also known by another name because of the way they behave: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)#Pipes">FIFOs</a>, or <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>i</strong>n, <strong>f</strong>irst <strong>o</strong>ut. What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>

      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

Many restaurants pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, while some experimented with take home meal and drink kits, and even virtual cooking classes. Some are finding new ways to use existing technology, like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/04/use-waitlist-online-takeout-restaurants?utm_source=biz_blog&amp;utm_medium=yelp_blog&amp;utm_content=blog_text_link">Yelp Waitlist to manage curbside pickup</a>. Servicing food to-go produces high margins for restaurants, and we’ve seen a 10X increase in searches for takeout since March 10.</p>
        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions. If nothing else, local businesses owners have proven themselves to be resilient and creative during these trying times.</p>

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

      <h2>The Recovering Economy May Look Different Than the Old Economy</h2>
        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>
