<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxG</span><span>-</span><span>minG</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minG</span><span>))</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxB</span><span>-</span><span>minB</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minB</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Wikipedia</a> offers an answer. Unfortunately there’s no citation,
but I’ve confirmed independently that it works. Here it is with some of my own math added as well.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a percentage, usually a float from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. It’s the amount the matrix will be applied to the
image. The closer to zero it is, the smaller the range of input colors that will be dithered. Colors outside
that range will be quantized. Usually you’ll want a strength of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, to apply the matrix and dither fully, but
sometimes reducing it can be useful, to reduce noise in the output image. It is inversely proportional to contrast –
that is, when you reduce the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, it is visually similar to increasing the contrast.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can also be negative, from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This is useful in certain cases where the matrix usually
makes things bright, like what Surma describes with Bayer matrices.</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>65535</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">65535</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is multiplied by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because the colours in my code are in the range <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>65535</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 65535]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If yours
are different you can change that number.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the value the entire matrix is divided by. It represents the maximum value of the matrix, and normalizes
it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t really emulate any of the yellow in the first example, while Floyd-Steinberg can. Once yellow is added
to the palette it looks pretty good though.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

<p>Nearly every solar power panel sold in the European Union has its origins in China’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/24/china-uighurs-europe-sanctions-381080" target="_blank">oppressed Xinjiang region</a>.</p>



<p>The solar industry and Brussels lawmakers argue Europe’s renewable energy push should not come at a human cost amid long-standing international concern over reports China has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un-idUSKBN1KV1SU" target="_blank">detained 1 million people</a> with Muslim backgrounds in camps in Xinjiang and is putting them to work.</p>



<p>“Everybody knows what’s going on in China, and when facilities are based there you have to accept that there’s a high possibility that forced labor will be used,” said Milan Nitzschke, president of <a href="https://www.prosun.org/en/mission-en/" target="_blank">EU ProSun</a>, an alliance of solar businesses seeking to promote sustainable, solar manufacturing based in the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the U.S. has already rolled out sanctions against products such as cotton and tomatoes originating from Xinjiang, the European Commission has avoided confronting China with any trade measures. </p>



<p>It has fallen to lawmakers in the European Parliament to try to push Brussels to implement trade bans, on all industries including solar panels, if companies are implicated in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>“Import bans need to complement as a last resort if forced labor is involved in the production, like in Xinjiang," said Green MEP Anna Cavazzini.</p>



<h3>Suspicions about every panel</h3>



<p>For the past decade Beijing has been carrying out a campaign to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1256994">detain and “reeducate”</a> the Muslim-majority population of the Xinjiang region.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have alerted that state-run reeducation centers <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1408155">double as forced labor camps</a>, with detained people obliged to work in low-skilled, labor-intensive sectors such as cotton picking. But recent reports out of the region suggest the Xinjiang government has also been focusing on “upskilling” the workforce and putting them to work in more specialized sectors.</p>



<p>That’s of particular concern to the global solar industry given Xinjiang’s outsized role in the production of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=62601">polysilicon</a>, a material used to make photovoltaic (PV) cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nearly every silicon-based solar module — at least 95 percent of the market — is likely to have some Xinjiang silicon in,” said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF.</p>



<p>Industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter added that last year roughly 45 percent of the global supply of solar-grade polysilicon came from the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw polysilicon is transported to factories — usually outside Xinjiang — and melted into cylinders, known as ingots. Because it’s blended with polysilicon produced in other regions, it’s difficult to trace material that could potentially come from forced labor camps in Xinjiang, Chase and Bernreuter said.</p>



<p>For any single solar panel “the mathematical probability is relatively high" it has some material produced in the province, said Bernreuter.</p>



<h3>An open secret</h3>



<p>Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-cotton-forced-labour-trfn-idUSKBN28P2CM" target="_blank">insists</a> the camps — which it calls “vocational training facilities” — are simply “helping people of all ethnic groups secure stable employment” and argues that this is “entirely different from forced labor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The China Photovoltaic Industry Association <a href="http://www.chinapv.org.cn/association_news/922.html" target="_blank">said</a> accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang were ”the lie of the century fabricated by several institutions and people from Western countries.”</p>



<p>In Europe, industry players said the potential use of forced labor to produce material included in solar panels imported into the EU was an open secret.</p>



<p>Industry group SolarPower Europe said it was investigating the situation in Xinjiang with its membership and looking at different options to ensure no forced labor was used in the PV manufacturing process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We cannot accept that such practices take place in the solar PV sector, which is a leader in sustainability and a key enabler of the energy transition,” said SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger.</p>



<p>The group said its members were using supply chain management guidelines, certifications and standards to ensure that forced labor was not used, and that it was evaluating how to encourage best practices across the industry.</p>



<h3>Distancing measures</h3>



<p>If the EU’s solar sector wants to distance itself from solar components manufactured under questionable circumstances in Xinjiang, it would have several ways of doing so.</p>



<p>Bloomberg NEF’s Chase said one option would be to continue accepting components made with polysilicon from China, but insisting that material produced in Xinjiang be exempted from the mix blended in factories.</p>



<p>“There’s plenty of non-Xinjiang polysilicon,” Chase said — around a quarter of the global market in 2021 is expected to come from the U.S. and the EU. But she said enforcing the exclusion would be complicated and likely make little difference for the plight of any workers. </p>



<p>Xinjiang polysilicon would simply shift to the domestic market and customers in the EU and the U.S. “will pay an almost unnoticeable amount more for modules,” said Chase. “Honestly, it is unlikely to be a big deal for solar, but good news for companies that make silicon outside Xinjiang.”</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, European manufacturers believe the answer is repatriating the industry back to the EU and using tariffs if necessary.</p>



<p>“Solar components can be produced in Europe,” EU ProSun’s Nitzschke said. “The companies making them were here until 2012 but they went bankrupt when the tariffs used to address Chinese overproduction and public financing were removed, allowing their companies to undercut us in terms of price.”</p>



<p>Nitzschke argued the EU should revise its trade deals and ensure that the same standards on human rights and forced labor that apply in Europe be extended to imported products. “We can’t have a level playing field if there’s ethical leakage, and you could prevent it by applying tariffs to products that don’t meet our standards.”</p>



<p>SolarPower Europe’s Hemetsberger said she didn’t favor trade tariffs due to their often counterproductive effect on European solar growth. "The best way of ensuring that imported goods abide by strict human rights protocols and ethical standards is improving the level of transparency of the global value chain so that EU-based suppliers can make informed decisions."</p>



<p>The European Commission has said the EU’s solar capacity needs to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en#:~:text=2030%20climate%20and%20energy%20framework%20%2D%20existing%20ambition,32.5%25%20improvement%20in%20energy%20efficiency" target="_blank">grow five-fold by 2030</a> to meet its climate targets. Hemetsberger said there was a “solar manufacturing renaissance” underway in Europe.</p>



<p>“Nearly all areas of the supply chain can be produced in Europe,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of <a href="https://www.meyerburger.com/en/company/about-meyer-burger/management/" target="_blank">Meyer Burger</a>, a Swiss-German solar module production company that aims to reestablish solar’s industrial supply chain on the Continent, pointing out that solar-grade polysilicon is <a href="https://www.wacker.com/cms/en-us/about-wacker/wacker-at-a-glance/profile-and-organization/wacker-polysilicon.html" target="_blank">already produced</a> at several sites in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a lot of respect for the Chinese strategy because 10 years ago they understood what Europe is still struggling to grasp: that solar is the future,” he said. “EU leaders speak of batteries, electric mobility, hydrogen … But where is the electricity to produce those things supposed to come from? We are already the technological frontrunners, what we need now is financing to bring production back.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing pressure on Brussels</h3>



<p>Solar panels are yet another example of goods made with forced labor entering the EU market, raising <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572638">criticisms from lawmakers and NGOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expects the EU to step up scrutiny of imports from Xinjiang, including solar power panels.</p>



<p>“The pressure is piling on the Commission and member states that they have to use unilateral means to send China a message, such as screening of imported products,” said Wuttke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-inestment-agreement-soft-approach-odds-us/">is taking its time</a> when its comes to tackling goods made with forced labor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commission is working on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1496802">a new tool</a> — due diligence legislation — which would make EU companies accountable if their suppliers breach labor and climate laws. But MEPs would like the Commission to go even further to tackle serious situations such as the one in Xinjiang. Last month, the European Parliament’s legal affairs committee <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1590418">called on</a> the Commission to introduce an import ban for “products related to severe human rights violations.”</p>



<p>“The EU due diligence legislation has a key role to play in that as it will help ensure that human rights are respected throughout our supply chains,” said MEP Cavazzini. She backs an import ban if suppliers are shown to be involved in human rights abuses.</p>



<p>The Commission is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance" target="_blank">set to</a> come up with its supply chain responsibility proposal by June after a public consultation ended this week.</p>



<p>According to Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is in charge of the file, new rules are likely to focus on so-called Tier 1 suppliers and to make reference to the International Labor Organization’s core conventions, which China committed to ratify under the new investment deal concluded with the EU.</p>



<p>“Expanding the use of renewables is of utmost importance in order to stop the climate crisis. But it cannot come at the cost of human rights,” said Cavazzini.</p>

While technically correct, I believe these attributes tend to overlook other surprising properties.</p><p>In this article, I invite readers to learn more about its internal features, many of which became predominant in the market only after the Virtual Boy’s discontinuation.</p><hr><h2 id="display">Display</h2><p>The whole system is a curious piece of engineering. Externally, it resembles a bulky VR headset on a bipod. The player must place their head close to the eyepiece to see the game in action.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/virtualboy/case/front.f5ed2bf56afcaf7238bb81e26e42ea66a11e68a40b14581affc282e9ee25c268.png"><picture>

In reality, games look very crisp and in full size!</figcaption></div><p>Internally, it’s a whole different story (and a very complicated one too). For this reason, I thought it would be better to start by explaining how this console displays images and then go through the internal hardware.</p><h4 id="projecting-an-image">Projecting an image</h4><p>Once you switch the Virtual Boy on, you will start seeing two <strong>monochromatic red</strong> pictures (one for each eye) through the eyepiece. So far so good? Well, here is the interesting part: <strong>This console doesn’t have a screen</strong>, so what you see is more of an ‘illusion’ - Let’s dive deeper to know what’s going on.</p><p>The topics involved in explaining this (optics, visual phenomenons, etc) may feel difficult at first, but I constructed some interactive animations to make this section little more immersive.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-scanner-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-scanner">Scanner</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-mechanics-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-display-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-display">Display</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-active-periods-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-active-periods">Active periods</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-scanner"><h4>Scanner</h4><p>The large volume of this console can be attributed to the <strong>Scanner</strong>, which fills up a big part of it. The Scanner is the area of the Virtual Boy that displays images. It’s composed of two <strong>Display units</strong>, each one independently projects a frame (giving a total of two frames, one per eye).</p><p>A Display unit is where all the ‘magic’ happens, it’s made of the following components:</p><ul><li>An <strong>LED Unit</strong>: Contains 224 red LEDs stacked vertically and the necessary circuitry to control each one of them.</li><li>A <strong>Lens</strong>: Refracts the light coming from the LEDs.<ul><li>At the top of the Virtual Boy’s case, there is a <strong>Focus slider</strong> used to shift the lenses closer or further away from the LEDs. This allows the user to adapt the console to their focal length (preventing blurry images).</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Mirror</strong>: Reflects the light coming from the lens and directs them to the user’s eyes. Furthermore, this component will be constantly oscillating thanks to a <strong>Voice coil motor</strong> connected to it. The motor is managed by the <strong>Servo control</strong>, a separate board which sends electrical pulses at 50 Hz.<ul><li>All in all, this is a very complex and fragile area of the console, so there’s a photo interrupter (a type of photosensor) installed. This reports the oscillation observed from the mirror to the Servo control, which in turns monitors the oscillations and applies the necessary corrections.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next to the focus slider there is a <strong>IPD dial</strong> (knob-shaped switch), which adjust the distance between the two Display units. This is done to adapt the displays to the user’s inter-pupil distance.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-mechanics"><h4>Mechanics</h4><div><figcaption>Basic representation of the angle of the oscillating mirror over time (at a very slow motion)<br>The left and right LEDs are operating (active) during the red and blue period, respectively<br>During the grey period, no LED is operating (idle)<br>For sake of simplicity, the angular velocity represented here is constant (but not in the real world)</figcaption></div><p>Now that we have each component identified, let’s take a look how the Virtual Boy manages to show images to our eyes.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed before, there <strong>isn’t any dot-matrix display to be found</strong>, so why are we seeing two-dimensional images from the eyepiece? Similarly to the functioning of a CRT monitor, Display units play with the way we perceive images:</p><ul><li>The fact the mirrors oscillate enables a single column of LEDs to displace horizontally between our field of view. The angle of the mirror is strategically directed to place the LEDs on 384 different ‘column positions’ distributed across our field of view.</li><li>Human vision is logarithmic and the mirror oscillates at <strong>50 Hz</strong> (each period takes 20 ms). This is so fast we end up perceiving 384 columns of LEDs illuminating at the same time (afterimage effect) until the mirror stops oscillating.</li><li>All of this is perfectly synchronised with the LED controller, which updates each LED bulb every time the mirror is slightly moved. Thus, we end up seeing a full picture coming from the eyepiece.</li></ul><p>In practice, there are some conditions for all these principles to work:</p><ul><li>The LEDs must only operate when the angular velocity of the mirror is stable (in other words, not when the mirror is changing direction). This can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#tab-2-4-result"><strong>Active State</strong></a> of a CRT monitor.</li><li>In relation to the previous point, the angular velocity of the mirror can’t stay constant (since the mirror can’t change direction instantly, the periods considered ‘stable’ will be subject to forces that will disrupt its velocity). To remedy this, the Virtual Boy stores a list of values in memory called <strong>Column Table</strong> which instructs how much time to dedicate for each column interval, in an effort to balance out excessive &amp; insufficient periods of ‘LED column’ exposure.</li><li>Let’s not forget that this whole process has to be done twice since we got two display units (one per eye). Unfortunately, both units can’t pull energy and data at the same time, so each one operates at different display periods (out-of-phase, 10ms apart). We don’t notice this (another illusion!).</li></ul></div><div id="tab-2-3-display"><h4>Display</h4><div><figcaption>Simplified representation of how the first LED unit operates during specific periods of time. Notice how the LEDs will start displaying each column of the frame-buffer during active periods.</figcaption></div><p>Contrary to previous video chips modelled after CRT displays (i.e. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">PPU</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#graphics">VGP</a>), graphics on the Virtual Boy are <strong>not rendered on-the-fly</strong>. The graphics chip on this console sends the processed frame to a frame-buffer in memory, each column of the frame is then sent to the LED array for display.</p><p>Once the Servo board detects it’s time for display, the graphics chip will start sending columns of pixels from the frame-buffer to those 224 vertically-stacked LEDs, one-by-one in a strategically synchronised matter so the LEDs will have shown 384 columns during the display period.

<p>This is the continuation of the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, III) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">We started this section last week </a>by looking at the forms of war along with the direct emotional experience of combat.  What we found is that, quite to the contrary of there being just one sort of war that ‘never changes,’ there are in fact multiple <em>systems</em> of war that function quite differently (with considerable variation both within and between those systems) to the point that armies often find opponents working from within a different system of war almost utterly alien to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, as we discussed, the experience of battle, not merely the technology, tactics and circumstances, but the <em>raw emotional experience</em> (taken in terms of courage and fear) wasn’t constant either.  Different cultures understood ‘courage’ differently (and we must remember that translation here can be deceiving – most of them didn’t understand ‘courage’ at all, they understood <em>andreia</em> or <em>fortis </em>or <em>corage</em> or <em>der Mut</em> or <em>woohitike</em> which are, in the end, subtly different things and so not quite ever exactly courage at all) and different battles imposed different sorts of fear which strained those combatants in different ways.</p>



<p>Now we’re going to keep soldiering on and look at some of the other factors of the war experience: the importance of comrades, the drudgery and toil of war, and of course wounds (both physical and mental) and their healing.  Once again, to abuse the opening lines of the <em>Fallout</em> series, we going to ask if it is really true that “War, war never changes.”</p>

<h2>The Ties that Bind</h2>



<p>What about the personal relationships that are formed in the context of conflict?  Surely, the ‘band of brothers’ is a truly universal experience, right (<a href="https://youtu.be/76_Q9ruJfrE">but note on the complexities of Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V</em></a>)?  Surely the social bonds that held<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)"> Easy-Company</a> together in 1944 and 1945 are the same as those from 1415?  Or 415?</p>



<p>Well, no.  Not quite.</p>



<p>We can approach this question through the idea of cohesion – the moral force that holds a group of combatants together on the battlefield under the intense emotional stresses of combat.  The intense bonds that soldiers form in modern armies (particularly those in the European pattern) are not an accident, but a core part of how those armies, institutionally, seek to build cohesion.  Going back to last week, we discussed briefly the emergence of the extensively drilled and disciplined ‘mechanical’ soldier of Early Modern Europe, noting that this approach wasn’t necessary for the effective use of firearms (the Ottoman Janissaries, for instance, were quite good with firearms, but were not trained and organized in this way), but rather was a product of elite aristocratic (read: officer) disdain for their up-jumped peasant soldiers and thus the assumption by those aristocrats that the only way to get such men to fight effectively was to relentlessly drill them.</p>

<p>Now the funny thing about this system is that it clearly <em>worked</em>, but not for the reasons its aristocratic pioneers believed.  It was only really after the Second World War that systematic study began to be made of unit cohesion (e.g. S.L.A. Marshall, <em>Men Against Fire</em> (1947), though subsequent literature on the topic is voluminous and Marshal’s work has its problems, but its conclusions are broadly accepted having been confirmed in subsequent studies).  What emerged quite clearly was that it wasn’t ‘the cause’ or patriotism that held troops together under fire, but group cohesion born out of an intense need not to let fellow soldiers in the unit down.  In short, what held units together and made them fight more effectively was (in part, there are many conclusions in <em>Men Against Fire</em>) the strong social bonds between comrades.</p>



<p>And, in fact, the drill and discipline of early modern European armies unintentionally did quite a lot of cohesion building things.  Soldiers were removed from civilian society (isolation from larger groups builds unit cohesion), split into very small groups (keeping the core group that coheres below <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a> aids in group cohesion; thus <a href="https://youtu.be/a15gihWu1SM">why the platoon is a natural unit size</a>) and then pushed through difficult and unpleasant training (that drill and discipline) creating a sense of unique shared experience and sacrifice.  All of which doesn’t render men <em>machines</em>, but it does create strong social bonds within the units that will keep the men fighting even when they care little for their cause (which they generally did in this period; one does not find a super-abundance of patriotism among, say, the Army of Flanders).</p>



<p>And there is a tendency to point to this cohesion, its modern source in ‘toughening’ boot camp and to say, ‘aha!  That is the true universal about effective soldier-warriors!’  Except – and you knew there was going to be an except – except it isn’t.  Systems built on the use of drill and discipline for the development of unit cohesion through social bonds are actually, historically speaking, quite rare.  We see systems like that in use by the Romans from the Middle Republic forward (but significantly faded by the end of late antiquity; the Byzantine army doesn’t seem to function this way), in China from the Han Dynasty onward, in Japan for the <em>ashigaru</em> infantry from the Sengoku period, and in Europe from the Early Modern period.  That <em>sounds</em> like a lot, but that is relatively small minority of the historical period and even then in a relatively small minority of places.  It is, for instance, a period that only covers about half of the historical period in Western Europe, the place most often associated with this very system of organization (though that association is perhaps unfair to East Asia).</p>



<p>Instead, most societies relied on existing social bonds formed <em>outside</em> of the experience of war for cohesion.  Greek hoplite armies, for instance, generally formed up by <em>polis</em> (read: city) and then within those blocks by still smaller and smaller social divisions, so that family and neighbors would be standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle line (Sparta does this through the system of communal messes, the <em>syssitia</em>, but the idea that you fought alongside the men you dined with socially – your neighbors, generally – was perfectly normal in most Greek cities).  That was intentional – it allowed the phalanx to cohere through the social pressure not to be seen as a coward before the men who meant the most to you, whose shaming gaze you would have to endure in civilian life.  The same pressures, by the well, held together the (mostly volunteer) armies of the American Civil War (on this, see, McPherson, <em>For Cause and Comrades</em> (1997)).</p>



<p>By contrast, ‘warrior’ classes often rely on a sort of class solidarity along with the demand of an individual military aristocrat to be <em>individually</em> militarily excellent.  Richard Kaeuper quips of the literature of the medieval knightly class that it was filled with “utterly tireless, almost obsessional emphasis placed on personal prowess” (R.W. Kaeuper, <em>Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe</em> (1999)).  We’ve talked a fair bit about the values of mounted aristocrats, both in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">their </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">role </a>as combatants and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/06/12/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-vii-hanging-by-a-thread/">in their roles as generals </a>and those values are relatively disconnected from discipline-induced forms of buddy-cohesion.  Of course exactly what ‘good generalship’ or ‘good officership’ looks like varies wildly from place to place – Alexander was expected to command his cavalry from the front; Roman emperors rarely took the battlefield and when they did they commanded from the rear since it would be foolish to risk the ‘brain’ of the army in personal combat and in any event someone at the front of a cavalry charge can hardly direct the rest of the army.</p>



<p>One of the things I find most striking about the ‘warrior ethos’ advanced by writers like Pressfield is that it accepts as normal the unique nature of the bonds that hold soldiers together in battle, assuming this bond and its shared sacrifice to be at once unique to combat and also transcendent to all combatants.  But one of the key points made very well in Sebastian Junger’s <em>War </em>(2010) and later <em>Tribe</em> (2016) is just how <em><strong>strange</strong></em> that experience is, historically.  <strong>Junger notes that in earlier societies, soldiers would have returned from war into communities </strong>(often small, agricultural communities or tribal communities) <strong>every bit as close-knit as the infantry platoon – and indeed, often involving <em>literally the same people</em> as the infantry platoon</strong>.  Instead, the intense feeling of uniqueness that modern soldiers feel about the bonds of combat is because of the historically unusual deracination produced by modern societies by the industrial revolution and the post-industrial period.</p>



<p>And Junger’s point is born out quite clearly when looking at the myriad of historical societies where those non-combat social bonds were the basis of the principles of military cohesion, be it the small-town cohesion of the hoplite phalanx or the class-based-expectation cohesion of a group of knights, or (for that matter) later modern …</p></div></div>

					<div>
						<p>When the US joined World War Two, it set back a number of peacetime R&amp;D projects. A team at Bell Labs had been studying some interesting properties of semiconducting substances, with the hope that they might find a way to replace the then-ubiquitous vacuum tube. But the exigencies of wartime complicated their plans—for one thing, the only supplier of sufficiently pure silicon was a German company—so they took a break to focus on wartime applications like radar. By the time they returned to regular work, the war was won, the US industrial base had dramatically ramped up (now DuPont, not German suppliers, made the world’s purest silicon), and the team had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of how substances like silicon and germanium behave.</p>
<p>Two years later, the transistor was born.</p>
<p>Crises radically reshape priorities; they cancel some projects, and accelerate others. But another effect they have is to make people more conscious of the future. To struggle through a crisis is, implicitly, to view the future as a point very much worth getting to. The Bell Labs team certainly helped build a better postwar future, and arguably Covid-19 has pushed people in the same direction.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t expect the results of this to be visible just yet. Scientific progress is visible on a lag: while the <i>New York Times</i> did mention the invention of transistors, it was midway through a column called “news of the radio,” hardly an accurate assessment of the impact of one of the twentieth century’s great inventions. Fortunately, there are more real-time ways to approximate people’s attitudes towards the future—the stock market is a real-time dollar-weighted poll about what kinds of companies will matter, and how that’s changing.</p>
<p>One of the surprising consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was that, after a brief and fearsome decline, overall asset prices rose. That’s partly an artifact of how policymakers responded to the pandemic; pumping liquidity into the market does help offset supply shocks, and some of that money finds its way into speculative vehicles. But even <i>within</i> the market, there’s been a striking rise in investor interest in electric vehicles, autonomous cars, AI, and software companies ranging from consumer-facing companies like Facebook and Google to complex enterprise products like Snowflake.</p>
<p>The market’s judgments always have to be taken judiciously. Humans are imperfect judges of the present, not to mention the future. And as the recent GameStop fireworks demonstrate, sometimes prices can be driven more by technical aspects of market structure than by a cold and calculating assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Even GameStop’s run-up, though, was born out of forward-looking analysis of a business, not gambling. The original thesis behind buying GameStop, before it turned into a social movement devoted to punishing hedge funds, <i>was</i> an argument that the company was fundamentally underpriced—because the market had missed its opportunity to transcend brick-and-mortar retailing and digitize its business!</p>
<p>There are definite precedents for extrapolating about new concerns from stock prices. Defense stocks rise when war is rumored to be imminent, for example, and cyclical stocks’ performance tends to change ahead of macro data on the economic cycle. More narrowly, the economist Armen Alchian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119914000546">deduced that hydrogen bombs use lithium by tracking the stock prices of mining companies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the world’s most valuable automaker is Tesla, with a market capitalization of $827bn, compared to $232bn for runner-up Toyota. Tesla isn’t valued based on its current production (just under 500,000 vehicles annually, compared to Toyota’s 9.2 million) or high margins (it eked out a net profit margin of just under 2%, less than half of Toyota’s results). Instead, Tesla is valued based on three forward-looking intangibles: it’s a pure-play electric vehicle company, its brand name is synonymous with clean energy rather than the more mixed reaction General Motors or Hyundai might engender, and its charismatic CEO has been able to recruit cult-like adherents to his vision of sustainable transportation and a multiplanetary species.</p>
<p>Calling Tesla is a cult isn’t pejorative, just descriptive: any organization that successfully accomplishes something that is widely believed to be impossible has to have distinctive beliefs, and any group of people who behave in unusual ways because of shared beliefs can be reasonably described as a cult. Some companies use their cultish aspects in harmful ways, but cults are a social design pattern that shows up over and over again, in successful companies and political movements. Cult-like traits are more common with companies that are growing fast—it would be hard for a steel mill or a local bank to engender this kind of behavior in its employees. It’s a way to focus everyone’s energy on the future, and avoid distracting questions about whether or not that future is viable—a way to raise the variance of outcomes, which makes extreme upside scenarios possible while increasing the odds of failure.</p>
<p>Tesla is not the only futuristic vehicle stock to be accorded a high value by the stock market. In fact, it’s arguably among the more mature. There are at least earnings to put a price/earnings multiple on, whereas many of the more recent EV companies are at an earlier stage than that. Luminar Technologies, for example, went public through a reverse merger late last year, and currently has a market value of almost $11bn. The company has minimal sales ($11m over the last nine months) and is still pouring money into R&amp;D. But LiDAR appears to be the most promising way to get cars to full autonomy, so investors are willing to value it based on the chance that a) autonomous vehicles will happen, b) they’ll use LiDAR, c) they’ll use Luminar’s systems to do it, and d) Luminar will be able to earn acceptable margins selling it.</p>
<p>The joint probability of all of those possibilities is low if they’re independent: if there’s a 10% chance of autonomous vehicles, a 10% chance they’ll use LiDAR, a 10% chance that LiDAR-using AVs will use Luminar’s technology, and a 10% chance that Luminar will get good margins, then the odds of Luminar being a good investment work out to 0.01%. But the more ambitious a company is, the more its job is to make those variables <i>conditional</i> instead: the closer a company gets to being the <i>only</i> way a given technology can happen, the more technology risk becomes synonymous with business risk, which compresses the overall range of outcomes. It also solves for the viable-business condition: if there’s just one company that can make AVs possible, then that company will have the pricing power necessary to make them profitable, too.</p>
<p>This dynamic actually works in two directions: first, it means that the odds of Luminar selling LiDAR conditional on LiDAR becoming ubiquitous are higher, because the latter is most probably going to happen if the former is true. And second, it’s a recruiting tool: if there’s one company that has a reasonable shot at accomplishing something, and it’s a desirable goal, then the company has a monopoly on the kinds of employees who can achieve that goal. This is a point Peter Thiel articulates in <i>Zero to One</i>, and it’s one of the reasons technology companies have such a skewed distribution of outcomes. They articulate a variant view, which means they attract people who share that variant view—and since the argument is settled by technology and economics, they don’t have to persuade the rest of the world, just to offer a better product.</p>
<p>The rise of special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, is a general testament to a more forward-looking market. In a conventional IPO, an operating company sells shares to the public; with a SPAC, an empty shell company goes public, and then identifies a private company to merge with. Due to a quirk in securities laws, a traditional IPO prospectus only shows a company’s backwards-looking estimates, and makes heavily-qualified statements about the future. A company that goes public through a SPAC is technically engaging in a merger, rather than an IPO, and the rules are different. When a public company buys another company, securities laws allow it to talk about that company’s anticipated growth, or the likely cost savings of the merger. Similarly, SPAC offerings can talk up a company’s long-term prospects, and even make exact estimates of future revenue.</p>
<p>SPACs have existed for years, but they exploded in popularity in 2020. Of the 466 SPAC companies that went public from 2011 through 2020, 248 of them went public in 2020 alone. A number of technical forces drove this—a large number of private companies looking for acquisitions, investors eager to get into <i>any</i> growth company early, some technicalities around SPAC issuance that make them attractive to specialist hedge funds. But the key driver of excitement about SPACs is that they can take companies public based on a future-focused outlook.</p>
<p>When Virgin Galactic went public by merging with Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, the company, which has taken deposits but generated minimal revenue, was able to project $590 million in annual revenue in the year 2023, and over a quarter of a billion dollars in pretax, pre-depreciation earnings. While this was optimistic, it’s also demonstrative: a company like Virgin Galactic would have been almost impossible to take public in a conventional way, because backwards-looking financial statements showed only losses. it may not work out as a business, or live up to its projections, but those projections got more plausible once it had access to public markets for funding.</p>
<p>High valuations for money-losing, often pre-revenue companies remind people of the dot-com bubble, and it’s worth putting that bubble in perspective. Someone who bought the market at its peak in March 2000 has earned a 6% compounded return since then. …</p></div></div></div>

      <div><p><i>I sent this email to the whole team at YC yesterday:</i></p><p>When I joined&nbsp;YC&nbsp;7.5 years ago, there weren’t many people around. PG and Jessica were still running things. We had offices in Mountain View, Palo Alto, and on Kearny street, but they were nearly always empty. The only meeting on any calendar was the lunch on Thursdays where we’d talk about companies over takeout or at a table in a crowded restaurant.</p><p>The ways in which we’ve changed since then have been amazing to see.&nbsp;YC&nbsp;has grown in every way imaginable. The scope of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;funds is larger. The team is bigger and more capable. The number of companies is pushing towards some ever receding upper bound. There’s more software, a larger community, and more programming designed to help&nbsp;YC&nbsp;founders build better futures.</p><p>I feel a deep sense of pride and honor at the part that I’ve played in that change and growth. I recall the first conversation I had with Aaron King about the Series A for Snapdocs. The questions he and I worked through were the kernel of the Series A program. I am amazed to see the directions in which Janelle is now building YCA. I’m grateful for the part I played in our conversations about growing beyond seed investing - conversations which eventually took shape as YCC. And, of course, there are fifteen batches worth of applications, interviews, dinners, office hours, and demo days rattling around in my head.<br></p><p>I’ve been thinking, recently, about the founders with whom I’ve had a chance to work. I’ve lost count of the number of incredible people I’ve gotten to know over these last years. Thinking back, it’s easy to see how the sheer weight of numbers can drive a person to be jaded about the problems that founders face. But the other night, as I spoke with a founder about a tough situation, I was reminded about how important it is to that individual that she gets the best possible advice. This is a lesson I learned time and again, and is something I hope I’ll never forget.</p><p>And then there’s the funny stuff. There were stolen air conditioners, barefoot pitches, robots that did not make sandwiches, update emails pulled from the I Ching, bandages, inhaled jet fuel, and literal blood on the interview floors. These are the things that I’ll remember long after everything else.</p><p>The truth is, I only meant to stick around&nbsp;YC&nbsp;for two years. Somehow, that two became two more, and then some more. As meaningfully as I’ve enjoyed my work here, it’s time for me to move onto something different and new and outside the bounds of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;does. That’s a strange, exhilarating moment, and an important one for me and for my family. The pandemic provided the practical and existential nudge I needed to see the depth of this need.</p><p>To my fellow partners - thank you for your tireless work for our founders and for&nbsp;YC. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me, for all the strange conversations we’ve had, and for all the demo day presentations we’ve crafted.</p><p>To PG and Jessica and Trevor and RTM - thank you for giving me this opportunity and for making&nbsp;YC&nbsp;the kind of place I could love enough to stay long after I meant to leave.</p><p>To Janelle - thank you for building YCA with me and for being the best person I could imagine to take it into the future.</p><p>To everyone else -&nbsp;YC’s mission in the world is abstract. It could mean so many things, but it wouldn’t be anything without your work. Whether you are managing founder expectations about housing in the Bay Area, helping someone understand the mysteries of cap tables, talking someone down off the ledge of yelling at a reporter, or making sure that there will one day be an office to come back to, you are what makes&nbsp;YC&nbsp;a viable, vital force in the world.</p><p>I’ve never liked&nbsp;goodbye.</p><p>aaron</p></div>

        <p>
          I've seen quite a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990566">few</a> <a href="https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.lipsurf.com/part-ii-after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why/">complaining</a> lately about the Kafkaesque Chrome extension review process, so when I started running into my own problems with the Chrome Web Store I wasn't exactly surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn’t until I submitted the same extension to the Firefox Add-Ons Store that I saw just how good things could be. In a world of walled gardens watched over by heavy handed reviewers, Firefox's review process was laughably good.

          <p>
            In January 2020 my buddy and I started working on an idea we had for an automation app. We called it Otto.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto consisted of two parts: a Mac app and a browser extension. After a few months worth of nights and weekends we had an alpha version we were ready to share with friends. I submitted the browser extension to Chrome under my own personal account, and after a review process of a couple days it was accepted. So far so good.
          </p>

          <p>
            The trouble started a few months later. After some more development and discussion, we re-framed our idea as an app to make custom keyboard shortcuts and we decided to rename Otto to <a href="https://keysmith.app/">Keysmith</a>. We also took the time at this point to create a company Google account. We renamed the extension and submitted it from our new company account.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear: changing the name was the <i>only</i> change we made.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few days later we received a rejection email. Here's a timeline of our interaction:

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit Keysmith to the Chrome Web Store.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                First rejection email.

                Quick summary:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Keysmith "violates the 'Use of Permissions' section"</li>
                <li>We should "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary"</li>
                <li>"If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality."</li>
                <li>We shouldn't attempt to "future proof"</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                We double check the permissions we've requested and can't find any problems. We respond asking for more detail.
                </p><p>
                We also mention that we had previously submitted the <i>same</i> extension with the <i>same</i> requested permissions, just under a different name (Otto). We hoped they'd say "oh, in that case we'll approve this right away!". But instead:
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                Otto, our <i>existing extension</i>, is removed from the store and no additional detail on the rejection is provided. In fact, this email contains the <i>same exact</i> text as the previous one.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond, again asking for more detail. We ask if it would help if we expanded on how we're using each permission in the permissions justification section.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the <i>exact same text again</i>. No further detail. No help at all.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We suspect these reviews are entirely automated, so we ask if we can speak to a "human reviewer", hoping this will trigger a manual review (we also consider dropping an f-bomb for the same reason, but decide to remain decent for now).
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with some <i>slightly</i> different text, but still nothing useful.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We try adding a lot more detail to the "justification" section for each of the permissions we use and we resubmit.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the exact same text as the first rejection.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond with one more plea for more more information.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the same text again.
              </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            At this point I dig into Chrome's documentation once again with a fine-tooth comb and I make a discovery: we had been requesting both the <span>tabs</span> and <span>activeTab</span> permissions, but since we also requested permission to run on <span>&lt;all_urls&gt;</span> it turns out that the features made available by <span>activeTab</span> were a strict subset of the features made available by <span>tabs</span>. So the <span>activeTab</span> permission was redundant. We weren't opening up any new functionality, we were just asking for a <i>redundant</i> permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This discovery made the Chrome review team's communications far more frustrating in retrospect. The line that all of their emails repeated was "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary". And, sure, we had asked for <span>activeTab</span> when we didn't need it, but that permission <i>didn't grant us any more functionality</i>. They had rejected our extension 6 times with no detail <i>because of a technicality</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We committed the 1 line diff removing the <span>activeTab</span> permission and resubmitted. A day later it was accepted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            A Firefox version of our browser extension had long been on our list, but for the first little while it didn't feel worth the additional support cost. We didn't know exactly how large that cost would be, but we suspected that there would be enough differences between the two browsers that it'd be a bit of a hassle to maintain them both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boy were we wrong. When we finally started looking into porting our extension to Firefox we found that we had to make <i>zero</i> changes to the code. None whatsoever. Firefox even supported the use of the global <span>chrome</span> object for accessing extension APIs (if you're curious, Chrome is not kind enough to return the favor).
          </p>

          <p>
            So we created a Firefox developer account, submitted our extension, and girded ourselves for another rough ride.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Boy were we wrong.</i>
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit the first version of our extension to Firefox.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                Less than 3 hours later we receive an email from Firefox that says, in effect, "Sorry this is taking so long, but we'll get to it soon!"
                </p><p>
                Responses from the Chrome team usually came in the wee hours of the morning, making the effective turnaround about 24 hours. Firefox apologizing after fewer than 3 hours was <i>hilarious</i> to us.
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We get an email saying the extension was accepted exactly 24 hours after submission.
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Further updates have been even speedier, usually only taking 2 or 3 minutes to be scanned and accepted. One of our updates even got accepted before I finished uploading the unminified source archive (which they require if you minify in production). And the dashboard shows your position in the review queue to give you some idea of when it'll complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air, and we won't be neglecting support for Firefox ever again in the future.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            I realize that in some ways this is an unfair comparison. Chrome's market share is much larger than Firefox's these days, so surely they also have to deal with far more extension submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the lack of transparency in their process was infuriating and counter-productive. Had someone taken the time to manually review our case, or at least <i>read any of the emails</i> we sent, we could've resolved this issue with one response. Instead it took 6 responses and a week of wondering if this review process would kill our product before it even launched.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really hope things improve, but I'm not counting on it.
          </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> when it was featured in hxp CTF and then on <a href="https://twitter.com/liveoverflow">LiveOverflow’s</a> YouTube channel. SerenityOS is an open source operating system written from scratch by <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomekling">Andreas Kling</a> and now has a strong and active community behind it. If you’d like to learn a bit more about it then the recent <a href="https://cppcast.com/serenity-os/">CppCast episode</a> is a good place to start, as well as all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/andreaskling">fantastic videos by Andreas Kling</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the recent videos were about writing exploits for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMvjaoBLPxA">typed array bug in javascript</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-TC6FtMs">kernel bug in munmap</a>. The videos were great to watch and got me thinking that it would be fun to try and find a couple of bugs that could be chained together to create a full chain exploit such as exploiting a browser bug to exploit a kernel bug to get root access.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>I started looking around and discovered an integer overflow when creating a typed array from an array buffer, the length was multiplied by the element size which could overflow.

<p>This could be used to create two powerful primitives, one that could read an arbitrary address and the other that could read an arbitrary amount from some allocated memory. These were the same primitives that Kling created in his video which meant that the issue could be exploited in exactly the same way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a vtable pointer with the offset primitive by spraying lots of Numbers</li>
  <li>Use the deterministic memory layout to calculating the stack location</li>
  <li>Find the saved return address on the stack</li>
  <li>Overwriting it with a rop chain.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I was looking into exploiting this, someone else spotted the same issue and it was quickly patched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60"><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/slack.jpg" alt="slack"></a></p>

<p>As I had already started and wanted to keep using the same issue, I kept working from <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/c899ace3ad1efbf1bc8f8ee2ebb1e35903d7224b">this commit</a> which still had the bug :)</p>

<p>Exploiting the issue is pretty much identical to the video above and it does a great job explaining what is going on, so I wont go into too much detail. Here Is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>After loading this up and setting a breakpoint with gdb at <code>0x9d000000</code>:</p>

<p>Success! Arbitrary code in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="kernel-bug-hunting">Kernel Bug Hunting</h3>

<p>Next it was time to try and find a kernel bug that could be reached from the browser process. There had been a few issues with integer overflows, so I started looking for places that this might happen. After some searching I saw the following in <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/22b0ff05d4a5b087d805d8147ca12efe410cb18f/Kernel/VM/RangeAllocator.cpp#L139">RangeAllocator::allocate_anywhere</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>available_range</span> <span>=</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>

    <span>// FIXME: This check is probably excluding some valid candidates when using a large alignment.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>(</span><span>effective_size</span> <span>+</span> <span>alignment</span><span>))</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each process has a list of available ranges that are used when allocating memory regions. This code is looping through all the ranges and seeing if there is one large enough to hold the requested size, taking into account the alignment (both <code>effective_size</code> and <code>alignment</code> are controlled by the user). The issue is that <code>effective_size + alignment</code> can overflow, resulting in a range being chosen that is too small to hold the requested size.</p>

<p>The <code>available_range</code> is then used to create a new allocated range:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>FlatPtr</span> <span>initial_base</span> <span>=</span> <span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>base</span><span>().</span><span>offset</span><span>(</span><span>offset_from_effective_base</span><span>).</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g.&nbsp;another 20 pages of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month. The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what, confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or generate automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/article/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design for machines vs.&nbsp;humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that. Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no. Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said – it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power. Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a> that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both, but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26114863">Hacker News</a> and landed on the front page, currently it’s on rank 3. I’m honored! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=26115086&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D26114863%2326115086">In the comments there</a> somebody mentioned an <a href="https://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg">interesting use of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in SVG</a>. I’m unsure though whether I should be impressed or horrified :D</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a> as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML, binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious war.</p>

                    <p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could sign up with a website with face recognition on your mobile phone and the next day on your MacBook you could just use your fingerprint scanner to sign in? What if we told you that this is possible today? </p><p>Currently you manage your accounts using passwords that you have to remember. For most users this is done by either remembering various different passwords, or worse; using the same one for every website. While social login has brought us a convenient way to sign in to websites using a single account, it still requires an account with a password. On top of that, there are security and privacy risks when using a single account for each service. Extra layers of security, like two factor authentication, can be added. But those come at the cost of complexity for the end user. The problem lies in passwords themselves. To solve it we should, and finally can, get rid of them all together to provide a user-friendly and secure authentication flow. </p><p>Even though it is still early and it has not landed in all browsers, we feel this is the future. We have already looked into what it takes to implement. As with any form of authentication, it is definitely not a trivial subject and it requires effort to implement. But please bear with us though, as we talk you through the steps. The result for the end user is definitely worth it.</p><p>Passwordless authentication on the web is made possible by the new Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API. If you’re not familiar with this API, you can check out <a href="https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn">this guide</a> or the video below to make it all a bit more tangible.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hk7kDRx3MuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The simplicity of using WebAuthn</figcaption></figure><h3 id="connecting-devices">Connecting devices</h3><p>The WebAuthn API supports replacing passwords with biometric data through device specific authenticators. These authenticators are, for example, the facial recognition &amp; fingerprint scanners built into (mobile) devices.</p><p>Creating accounts and logging in with a device-specific authenticator has one problem. The fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone isn’t connected to the one on a laptop. So, how does a user access their account on a laptop if they created the account on a mobile phone? </p><p>For multi-device passwordless authentication we created a proof-of-concept flow. Our solution uses a secure environment already shared on all devices: email. A secure link sent through email connects the laptop &amp; mobile phone. No typing required at all. Let’s explore this flow together.</p><h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h3><p>For most server side languages, there’s a library available that does the heavy lifting around WebAuthn by implementing FIDO2. We went with <a href="https://github.com/abergs/fido2-net-lib">abergs/fido2-net-lib</a> on .NET core. The juicy part is in expanding the user interaction flow. Let’s start with registration. </p><p>A user enters a desired username (a valid email in our case), presses the register button and is presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge that is sent by the server. When the user successfully authenticates with their biometric info, an account is created for that user.</p><p>During account creation, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device creates public + private key</li><li>Device sends public key as response</li><li>Server creates user account associated to that public key</li></ol><p>When a user later wants to login to the website, they enter their username (email) again and then are presented with a biometric confirmation modal to resolve a generated challenge. This time the server checks if the response (that the browser generates based on the given challenge and private key) matches the user with the given email address. If that’s the case, the user is logged in.</p><p>During user login, these steps are executed:</p><ol><li>Server sends challenge</li><li>Device requests biometric confirmation</li><li>User scans finger</li><li>Device signs challenge with private key</li><li>Device sends response to server</li><li>Server verifies response with public key</li></ol><p>On a technical level this is not too different compared to a regular password login, if you would hash and salt the password before sending it over. The biggest difference is we’re not asking the user to authenticate with something that needs to be remembered.</p><h3 id="implementing-multi-device-sign-in">Implementing multi-device sign-in</h3><p>Logging in with a platform authenticator only works if the local device has credentials stored for this website. The first step in making multi-device possible is by detecting if the device has credentials for the current website user account or not. If it doesn’t, the Web Authentication API will throw an error. This allows us to ask the user if they want to add this device to their account.</p><figure><pre><code>let credentials;
try {
  credentials = await navigator.credentials.get(optionsObject);
} catch (err) {
  // Show modal to ask if the user wants to add this device to their account
  confirmAddDevice();
}</code></pre><figcaption>Detect if the device platform authenticator has known credentials</figcaption></figure><p>This is the hook that allows us to extend the user experience. For our take on a possible UX flow for passwordless multi-device authentication we came up with the diagram below. Highlighted in blue is the email confirmation flow that we found missing in existing implementations of logging in without a password. Remember that, while this diagram may seem daunting at first, all the parts in black are taken care of by WebAuthn and the FIDO2 library. Luckily that also is the hardest and most boring part.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vwtyGrDkcChPhUrxucOV-6IbyzezykWKK-NI_KEF4px3Ke-uGunrfKZXd34gd0z5R0tfd1-xEiidbgTCVbKK09qdhKiW6ezDYaUg_keR61DoGJmJR1Xs4vXokVCnSzWAD2fSwFFG"><figcaption>Expand the platform authenticator flow to support multiple devices</figcaption></figure><p>Our flow starts when the user wants to sign in to their existing account from an unknown device. The flow starts similar to the regular login flow. However, we can now detect when the device has no credentials stored for this website.</p><p>Interaction wise this is where things get interesting. We can let the user know that this is an unknown account that is being attempted to sign in to. But just showing an error is a dead path. A user expects an immediate follow-up action to add this device to the account.</p><p>In our case we show a modal to ask the user if they want to add the new device:</p><figure><pre><code>async function confirmAddDevice() {
  const confirm = confirm('Do you want to add this device to your account?');
  if (!confirm) {
    // User denied the confirm modal, do nothing
    return;
  }

  try {
    await fetch('/api/add-device', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: {
        email: this.email
      }
    });

    alert('Email sent, click the link in the mail to continue the process.')
  } catch {
    alert('Could not send an email, please try again later.')
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption>Ask the user if they want to add the device to their account</figcaption></figure><p>When the user confirms the action, the client sends a request to the server. Luckily we know how to securely contact the user because they registered with their email as username. The server then sends an email that allows the user to register their device.</p><figure><pre><code>[HttpPost]
[Route("/add-device")]
public async Task&lt;JsonResult&gt; AddDevice([FromBody] string email)
{
  var user = Storage.GetUser(email);
  if(user == null) {
    return NotFound();
  }

  var otp = Storage.GenerateAndStoreOneTimePasswordForUser(user);

  var response = await SendAddDeviceEmail(user, otp);
  return Json(response);
}</code></pre><figcaption>Send an email to the user</figcaption></figure><p>By clicking the link in the email, the user confirms this device may be added to their account. The flow is just like with the first device, only adding a one time password (OTP) in the form of a link in an email. The OTP allows the new device to be securely linked to the existing account. This is done by the server, which checks if the OTP matches the one generated for the user, and stores the challenge response as an additional device linked to the account.</p><p>This way, minimal user input is required to allow multi-device passwordless authentication on the web. On top of that, we leverage existing patterns for account validation (through email) that users are already used to on the web.</p><h3 id="outro">Outro</h3><p>We are very excited to work towards a more secure and effortless web, and can’t wait to use this in production. What’s your opinion on passwordless authentication, and how should multi-device usage be addressed? We would love to hear your ideas and get to know your implementations.</p><hr><p><em>Do you love figuring out new features like multi-device passwordless authentication?

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

    </em></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Quite a while back I wrote a larger article on the algebraic foundation of software patterns which also covered the <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">MapReduce algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>During the research digged out a paper on <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0498/3a1c0d6343e21129aaffca2a1b3eec419523.pdf">algebraic properties of distributed big data analytics</a>, which explained that a MapReduce will always work correctly when the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a Monoid under the <code>reduce</code>-operation.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not convinced that this Monoid-condition was enough, because all the typical examples like word-frequency maps are even <strong>commutative</strong> Monoids under the respective reduce operation.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following personal theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a <strong>commutative Monoid</strong> under the <code>reduce</code>-operation, then a parallel MapReduce will produce correct results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to validate this property using the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2">QuickCheck test framework</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the QuickCheck tests failed! This finally convinced me that my theory was wrong, and after a little deeper thought, I could understand why.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.</p>
<p>The code shown in this blog <a href="https://github.com/thma/CommutativeMonoid">is also available on GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="commutative-monoids">Commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>In abstract algebra, a monoid is a <em>set</em> equipped with an <em>associative binary operation</em> and an <em>identity element</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest example for a <em>commutative Monoid</em> is <span>\((\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0)\)</span>: the natural numbers under addition with <span>\(0\)</span> as the identity (or neutral) element. We can use QuickCheck to verify that indeed the Monoid laws plus commutativity are maintained.</p>
<p>If we want to use <code>GHC.Natural</code> type to represent natural numbers, we first have to make <code>Natural</code> instantiate the <code>Arbitrary</code> type class which is used by QuickCheck to automatically generate test data:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.QuickCheck</span> (<span>Arbitrary</span>, arbitrary, <span>NonNegative</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>import</span>           <span>GHC.Natural</span>     (<span>Natural</span>, naturalFromInteger)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>instance</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  arbitrary <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span>NonNegative</span> nonNegative <span>&lt;-</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span>return</span> <span>$</span> naturalFromInteger nonNegative</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can start to write our property based tests. For algebraic structures it is straightforward to come up with properties: we just write the required laws (associativity, 0 is identity element and commutativity) as properties.</p>
<p>I am using Hspec as a wrapper around QuickCheck as it provides a very nice testing DSL which makes it easy to read the code and the output of the test suite:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.Hspec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>spec ::</span> <span>Spec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">spec <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Natural Numbers under Addition'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x <span>+</span> y) <span>+</span> z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> ((x <span>+</span> (y <span>+</span> z))<span> ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-8">      </span>
<span id="cb2-9">    it <span>"has 0 as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x <span>+</span> <span>0</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>0</span> <span>+</span> x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span>
<span id="cb2-11">      </span>
<span id="cb2-12">    it <span>"is commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>+</span> y <span>`shouldBe`</span> (y <span>+</span><span> x ::</span> <span>Natural</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of these tests will be as follows:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>Monoid</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Natural Numbers under Addition'</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>has</span> 0 as identity (or neutral) <span>element</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-7">    <span>is</span> commutative</span>
<span id="cb3-8">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So behind the scenes, QuickCheck has generated test data for 100 tests for each property under test. For all these data the test cases passed.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a proof. But it gives us some confidence that our math text-books are correct when giving Natural Numbers under addition as an example for a commutative Monoid.</p>
<p>OK, that was easy! Now let’s move to non-commutative Monoids.</p>
<h2 id="non-commutative-monoids">Non-commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>Strings (or any other Lists) under concatenation are a typical example. It’s easy to see that <code>"hello" ++ ("dear" ++ "people")</code> equals <code>"(hello" ++ "dear") ++ "people"</code>, but that <code>"hello" ++ "world"</code> differs from <code>"world" ++ "hello"</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to formalize these intuitions as QuickCheck property based tests again.</p>
<p>First I’m introducing an alias for <code>(++)</code>, as it is defined on any list type, it would be required to have type signatures in all properties (as we had all those <code>:: Natural</code> signatures in the examples above). So I define an operation <code>(⊕)</code> which is only defined on <code>String</code> instances:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">(⊕)<span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">(⊕) a b <span>=</span> a <span>++</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can extend our test suite with the following test cases:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Strings under concatenation'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">    </span>
<span id="cb5-3">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb5-4">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x ⊕ y) ⊕ z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> (x ⊕ (y ⊕ z))</span>
<span id="cb5-5">      </span>
<span id="cb5-6">    it <span>"has \"\" as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x ⊕ <span>""</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> x) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>""</span> ⊕ x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks promising:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb6-3">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb6-4">    <span>has</span> <span>""</span> as left and right identity element</span>
<span id="cb6-5">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s try to test the non-commutativity:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">    it <span>"is NOT commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>`shouldNotBe`</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But unfortunately the output tells us that this is not true:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">    <span>is</span> NOT commutative FAILED [1]</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3">  <span>1</span>) <span>Monoid</span>, The Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span>, is NOT commutative</span>
<span id="cb8-4">       <span>Falsifiable</span> (after 1 test)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">       <span>not</span> expected: <span>""</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We formulated the property in the wrong way. The <code>(⊕)</code> <em>may be commutative for some</em> edge cases, e.g.&nbsp;when one or both of the arguments are <code>""</code>. But it is not commutative <em>in general</em> – that is for all possible arguments.</p>
<p>We could rephrase this property as <em>“There exists at least one pair of arguments <span>\((x, y)\)</span> for which <span>\(\oplus\)</span> is not commutative”</em>:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>QuickCheck does not come with a mechanism for <em>existential quantification</em>. But as is has <code>forAll</code>, that is <em>universal quantification</em>. So we can try to make use of the following equivalence:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ] 
  \equiv 
  \neg \forall (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y = y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately we can not write this simply as <code>not forAll</code>, as <code>forAll</code> returns a <code>Property</code> but <code>not</code> expects a <code>Bool</code>. But as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42764847/is-there-a-there-exists-quantifier-in-quickcheck">this discussion on Stackoverflow</a> it is still posible to implement our own <code>exists</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>exists ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Arbitrary</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">exists <span>=</span> forSome <span>$</span> resize <span>1000</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>forSome ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Testable</span> prop) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Gen</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> prop) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">forSome gen prop <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6">  mapResult (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r {P.reason <span>=</span> <span>"No witness found."</span>, P.callbacks <span>=</span> []}) <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">    once <span>$</span> disjoin <span>$</span> <span>replicate</span> <span>1000</span> <span>$</span> forAll gen prop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can rewrite the property <span>\(\exists (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">    it <span>"is not commutative (via exists)"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">      exists <span>$</span> \(x,y) <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>/=</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I like how close the Haskell code stays to the concise mathematical formulation! The output of this test fits much better into our intuitive understanding:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">    <span>is</span> not commutative (via exists)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 1 test.</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="sequential-mapreduce">Sequential MapReduce</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify <strong>a map function</strong> that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, <strong>and a reduce function</strong> that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</p>
<p>[This] abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">Quoted from Google Research</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going into more details here, as You’ll find detailed information on this approach and a working example <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">in my original article</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a sequential MapReduce:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">simpleMapReduce </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)   <span>-- map function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>-&gt;</span> ([b] <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-- reduce function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>-&gt;</span> [a]        <span>-- list to map over</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5">  <span>-&gt;</span> c          <span>-- result</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">simpleMapReduce mapFunc reduceFunc <span>=</span> reduceFunc <span>.</span> <span>map</span> mapFunc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can test the sequential MapReduce algorithm with the following property based test:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">    it <span>"works correctly with a sequential map-reduce"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">      property <span>$</span> \a b c d <span>-&gt;</span> (simpleMapReduce <span>reverse</span> (<span>foldr</span> (⊕) <span>""</span>) [a,b,c,d]) </span>
<span id="cb13-3">                     <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>reverse</span> a) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> b) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> c) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> d)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="excurs-foldmap">Excurs: foldMap</h3>
<p>What I have shown so far just demonstrates the general mechanism of chaining <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions without implying any parallel execution. Essentially we are chaining a <code>map</code> with a <code>fold</code> (i.e.&nbsp;reduction) function. In the Haskell base library there is a higher order function <code>foldMap</code> that covers exactly this pattern of chaining. Please note that <code>foldMap</code>does only a single traversal of the foldable data structure. It fuses the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> phase into a single one by function composition of <code>mappend</code> and the mapping function <code>f</code>:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>-- | Map each element of the structure to a monoid,</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>-- and combine the results.</span></span>

<h2 id="parallel-mapreduce">Parallel MapReduce</h2>
<p>Now we come to the tricky part that kicked off this whole discussion: parallelism.</p>
<p>As an example we consider a simple sequential MapReduce, taking an input list of <code>Int</code>s, computing their squares and computing the sum of these squares:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> simpleMapReduce (<span>^</span><span>2</span>) (<span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span>) [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>]</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span>30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try to design this as a massively parallelized algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mapping of <code>(^2)</code> over the input-list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> would be started in parallel to the reduction of the intermediary list of squares by <code>(foldr (+) 0)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping phase will be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each element of the input list).</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction phase will also be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each addition).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the reduction phase can begin only when at least one list element is squared. So in effect the mapping process would have to start first. The parallel computation of squares will result in a non-deterministic sequence of computations. In particular it is not guaranteed that all elements of the input list are processed in the original list order. So it might for example …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post we’ll discuss how Spotify optimized and sped up elements from our largest Dataflow job, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/18/spotify-unwrapped-how-we-brought-you-a-decade-of-data/" target="_blank">Wrapped 2019</a>, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page">Wrapped 2020</a> using a technique called Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join. We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Shuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf">2018 master’s thesis</a>, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html" target="_blank">Scio module</a> afterwards.</p>



<h2>Design and Implementation</h2>



<p>The majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spotify/scio" target="_blank">Scio</a>, a Scala API for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, and run on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> service. We implemented SMB in Java to be closer to the native Beam SDK (and even wrote and collaborated on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing">design document with the Beam community</a>), and provide Scala syntactic sugar in Scio like many other I/Os. The design is modularized into the main components listed below — we’ll start with the two top-level SMB <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTransforms</a> — the write and read operations SortedBucketSink and SortedBucketSource.</p>



<h3>SortedBucketSink</h3>



<p>This transform writes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections" target="_blank">PCollection</a>&lt;T&gt; (where T has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/FileOperations.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileOperations&lt;T&gt;</a> instance) in SMB format. It first extracts keys and assigns bucket IDs using logic provided by <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/BucketMetadata.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BucketMetadata</a>, groups key–values by the ID, sorts all values, and then writes them into files corresponding to bucket IDs using the FileOperations instance.</p>



<p>In addition to the bucket files, a JSON file is also written to the output directory representing the information from BucketMetadata that’s necessary to read the source: the number of buckets, the hashing scheme, and the instructions to extract the key from each record (for example, for Avro records we can encode this instruction with the name of the GenericRecord field containing the key).</p>

<h3>SortedBucketSource</h3>



<p>This transform reads from one or more sources written in SMB format with the same key and hashing scheme. It opens file handles for corresponding buckets from each source (using FileOperations&lt;T&gt; for that input type) and merges them while maintaining sorted order. Results are emitted as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/join/CoGbkResult.java" target="_blank">CoGbkResult</a> objects per key group, the same class Beam uses for regular Cogroup operations, so the user can extract the results per source with the correct parameterized type.</p>

<h3>FileOperations</h3>



<p>FileOperations abstracts away the reading and writing of individual bucket files. Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.</p>



<h3>BucketMetadata</h3>



<p>This class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.</p>



<h3>Optimizations and Variants</h3>



<p>Over the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Date partitioning:</strong> At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories <em>per source</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharding:</strong> Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of <em>shards</em> to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence"><em>per bundle</em></a>. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:<ul><li><strong>Minimum parallelism,</strong> or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.</li><li><strong>Maximum parallelism,</strong> or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.</li><li><strong>Auto parallelism:</strong> Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.</li></ul></li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="459" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-250x164.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-768x504.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-120x79.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3.png 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>SortedBucketTransform:</strong> A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="320" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-250x114.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-768x351.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-120x55.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4.png 902w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>External Sort:</strong> We made a number of improvements to Beam’s <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter">external sorter extension</a>, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Core Data Producers</h2>



<p>Since SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.</p>



<p>Implementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:</p>



<ul><li>Agree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.</li><li>Set compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.</li><li>Make sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Wrapped 2020</h2>

While writing the port I just focus on getting the Rust code as elegant as possible to achieve that I research the Rust API's to get syntactically correct.

My first reaction (in an act of self denial) was to check the compiler flags <code>opt-level</code> and after checking that was fine, which to be honest won’t make a difference, I started to look for inefficiencies in the code, first using the ancient <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html">Drunk man anti-method</a> technique and when that didn’t work, I end up settling for a more scientific method of profiling my code with <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>.</p><h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2><hr><p>Every time you are debugging a performance issues you might feel tempted to start adding your own function to calculate the duration of suspicious section of code (like I used to do, in the past). <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">Perf</a> does this for you by taking various approaches such as listening to CPU/Kernel <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/developer_guide/perf">performance events</a> metrics emitted by the system in reaction of your process while running.

</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Going back at the code, this binary search is done twice per iteration now multiply this by <code>50K</code> and we found the reason for the slow down.</p></blockquote><p>After some googling I found that I should use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/str/mod.rs.html#4006">eq_ignore_ascii_case</a> instead, which basically makes this operation in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.37.0/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#2487">linear time</a> and for one character is nearly the same as saying constant time.

But this leaves me with some questions:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>91ms</code> is not bad, but I wonder how much effort it will take to optimize this code to make it <code>&gt;1.5x</code> faster than the Javascript counterpart?</p></blockquote><h2 id="performance-on-macos">Performance On MacOS</h2><p>While I was thinking of this and was in the middle of unpacking my Rust stickers and preparing my laptop for some re-branding, I decided to move the code (Javascript and Rust) from my Linux VM to my main OS (<strong>MacOS Catalina</strong>), once there I gave the benchmark another try because I <em>love</em> suffering:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Google (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7380435?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-do-you-determine-that-a-site-is-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Google</a>, its Safe Browsing system works by scanning sections of Google’s web index and “identifying potentially compromised websites.” Then, Google tests those websites by using a virtual machine to check if the website compromises the system. If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

<p>A Python library for unevenly-spaced time series analysis.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why?<a href="#why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Taking measurements at irregular intervals is common, but most tools
are primarily designed for evenly-spaced measurements. Also, in the
real world, time series have missing observations or you may have
multiple series with different frequencies: it’s can be useful to
model these as unevenly-spaced.</p>
<p>Traces aims to make it simple to write <em>readable code</em> to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrangle</strong>. Read, write, and manipulate unevenly-spaced time series data</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>. Perform basic analyses of unevenly-spaced time series
data without making an awkward / lossy transformation to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
<li><strong>Convert</strong>. Gracefully transform unevenly-spaced times series data to
evenly-spaced representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Traces was designed by the team at <a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/">Datascope</a> based on several practical
applications in different domains, because it turns out
<a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/unevenly-spaced-time-series/">unevenly-spaced data is actually pretty great, particularly for
sensor data analysis</a>.</p>

<p>To install traces, run this command in your terminal:</p>

<h2>Quickstart: using traces<a href="#quickstart-using-traces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To see a basic use of traces, let’s look at these data from a light
switch, also known as <em>Big Data from the Internet of Things</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="light switch trace" src="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/trace.svg"></p>
<p>The main object in traces is a <a href="https://traces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#timeseries"><span>TimeSeries</span></a>, which

<p>What if you want to know if the light was on at 11am? Unlike a
python dictionary, you can look up the value at any time even if it’s
not one of the measurement times.</p>

<h2>What is the “magic kernel”?</h2>

<p>The “magic kernel” is, today, a colloquial name for
Magic Kernel Sharp+, an image resizing algorithm
that is fast and efficient yet produces amazingly clear and sharp
results, and has helped
power the two largest social media photo sites in the world.</p>

<p>I first came across what I dubbed at that time
“the magic kernel” in 2006 in
the source code for what is now the standard JPEG library.
This “kernel”—essentially just
the weights 1/4 and 3/4—allowed
an image to be doubled in size, as many times as desired, astonishingly
clearly.
Experts pointed out, however, that the resulting images were
slightly blurrier
than an ideal resizer would produce.</p>

<p>In 2011 I investigated its remarkable properties
in depth, as a hobby, and generalized it to allow resizing
an image to any size.</p>

<p>In early 2013, while working with another Software Engineer at Facebook
to address some quality issues with the back-end resizing of all
photos uploaded to Facebook,
I realized that adding a simple three-tap sharpening step to
the <em>output</em> of a magic-kernel-resized image
yielded a fast and efficient resizing algorithm with close to
perfect fidelity.
I dubbed the combined algorithm “Magic Kernel Sharp.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, this factorization of the algorithm into two
independent parts—the original
Magic Kernel resizing step, plus a final Sharp step—allows
one to make use of hardware acceleration libraries that provide
only same-size filtering functions and non-antialiased resizing functions.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these properties,
by mid-2013 we were able to deploy Magic Kernel Sharp
to the back-end resizing of images on Facebook—with
not only better quality but also greater CPU <em>and</em> storage efficiency
than the code stack it replaced.

</p><p>When in early 2015 another Software Engineer sought to migrate Instagram
across to Facebook’s back-end image resizing infrastructure,
we realized that the existing Instagram
stack provided extra “pop” for the final image
through extra sharpening.
I simply adjusted the Magic Kernel Sharp code to include this additional
sharpening as part of the Sharp step, which allowed us to deploy
this “Magic Kernel Sharp+” to Instagram—again,
with greater CPU and storage
efficiency <em>and</em> higher quality and resolution
than the code stack it replaced.</p>

<p>In 2021 I derived a small refinement to the
2013 version of Magic Kernel Sharp, which yields a kernel that is
still completely practical, but can moreover be shown to be
mathematically ideal to at least nine bits of accuracy.</p>

<p>In the rest of this page
I provide a historical overview of
this development of
the magic kernel, together with some totally irrelevant and ignorable
(but hopefully amusing to some) personal
history.
(Alternative title: “How a colorblind Australian ended up
fixing most of the cat photos on the Internet.”)</p>


<h2>1982–2006: Pre-history</h2>

<p>(This section has nothing to do with the magic kernel, and can be
skipped.)</p>

<p>By September 1983, after
five months of working after school a couple of days a week
at McDonald’s, I had
saved the $620 I needed to buy an Apple&nbsp;II clone
(manufactured illegally in Asia) out of the
<em>Trading Post</em>, the weekly Melbourne newspaper
that listed mainly second-hand
items for sale.
(It was not dissimilar to my
saving my pocket money for six months in around 1973
to buy the latest in digital technology then available:
a $9.99 four-function calculator, the dog-eared K-Mart catalog page for
which I lovingly
kept next to my piles of pen-and-paper written calculations.)
The Apple&nbsp;II had just 48&nbsp;KB of RAM, and no floppy disk drive—programs were
saved to and reloaded from audio cassettes, if you had a tape recorder
handy to connect to the computer with an audio cable—but
I finally had my own
computer.</p>

<p>Bitmapped graphics caught my attention immediately (it even had six
different colors!).
After exhausting what I could do with the very slow
graphics functionality contained in
Applesoft BASIC (I think my first graphics
program on a school Apple&nbsp;II computer in early
1982—the earliest chance I had to use a computer—was
a graph of
“biorhythms,” which seemed quite advanced to a
15-year-old kid who didn’t even know what a sine function was),
I moved on to machine code,
even building a simple but visually accurate
emulation of one part of Pac-Man. (Without sounds.)</p>

<p>By 1985 I had dropped out of a Science/Engineering double degree at
Monash University (before the
“census date,” so officially I never went there;
having been expelled from a school in 1981 had reduced my sensitivity
to such future-changing decisions).
As well as climbing to management at McDonald’s, I
was building my own interface cards for my
Apple&nbsp;II, making use of those graphics programming skills
to create the circuit board
layouts, which I would print out at larger scale
on a dot-matrix printer,
have photographically reduced at a photo store
to transparencies at the final size, and then
expose (using a 240&nbsp;V ultra-violet fluorescent light mounted in
a beer cooler!) onto the circuit board blank
before exposing it to the chemicals needed to etch away the copper.

<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/circuit-3.jpg" width="495" height="180">
</p>

<p>(Photographed decades later, by which time
the unprotected copper had been
attacked by the elements.)
My cousin
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stephen.koekoek">Stephen</a>
liked this digital drum machine so much (I can still hear
his compositions of Phil Collins’ <em>Sussudio</em> drums in
my head, even today)
that four years later he bought
the computer and the final iteration of the digital sampling card off me
for his own use.
But I am getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>My interest in pursuing electronics led a family friend to suggest that I
apply to restart my university studies in 1986 in
an Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Melbourne.
It may have been the best advice that I ever received.</p>

<p>By December 1989, three summers of interning at IBM during
that degree
had allowed me to save enough money to
follow the trend of my university peers in moving
away from the Apple&nbsp;II, and upgrade
to (what else?) an IBM PC (actually a
genuine PS/2 Model&nbsp;50—no clone this time around).
I now had the opportunity to use VGA graphics—space-age
science fiction
compared to the graphics of the Apple&nbsp;II.
I decided to move from the machine code of the Apple&nbsp;II to a new language
that I had learned the previous year in my Engineering degree,
which was close enough
to machine code that it was in many cases just as fast, but which
worked across different machines and microprocessors—and had
just been standardized by the American National Standards Institute: C.
I even went to a computer shop and bought a copy of
Microsoft QuickC—the first time that I had paid money for
software.</p>

<p>Having now <em>spent</em> money on software,
I soon thought up an idea for <em>making</em> money from this new technology,
leveraging my growing proficiency with computer graphics
(something I needed to do, as I had perhaps foolishly gotten the bug for
theoretical physics, starting the process of doing a Ph.D. in the field,
which basically eliminated my chance of earning any real money for the
foreseeable future, and ending my prospects for any more internships at IBM).
My mother had for decades done cross-stitch embroideries, buying the
printed
“patterns” for them from handcraft stores, and
I knew that there was a small but dedicated cadre of embroiderers who
did likewise.
I had also had the chance, while interning at IBM, to use a new device that
would scan a piece of paper and convert it to a digital bitmapped image
on a computer:
a “scanner.”
By 1990, HP had just released the first color scanner cheap enough
for the domestic market, and laser printers were also becoming cheap enough
to not just be the domain of huge companies.
Could I write a program that scanned photographs and converted them to
laser-printed cross-stitch design patterns?</p>

<p>Before laying out any hard cash for a color scanner,
I decided to try out the process on
a test image that was on a floppy disk accompanying
a book on computer graphics that I had bought.
(There was no World Wide Web in 1990.)
It worked: my mother actually stitched it (I still have it hanging on our
wall):</p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/frog-test-image.jpg" width="400" height="300">
<img src="http://www.johncostella.com/magic/frog-cross-stitch.jpg" width="400" height="300">
</p>

<p>After talking to the folks who ran the embroidery shop where my mother
bought her patterns and materials, it seemed likely that
I could sell such a service for $50 per design.
I did a quick break-even analysis, and decided to make the investment in
the HP scanner.</p><p>And in the years to follow,
“Costella Design” (just a name, not a real company)
did recoup that investment, and then some.</p>

<p>My C graphics programming moved on
to visually simulating the motion and spinning
of particles that I was deriving
equations of motion for in my Ph.D. studies (I still have a VHS
videotape of a simulation I showed in one presentation).
In early 1994, with government funding running out for me to complete
my Ph.D. thesis by June 30, I estimated that it would take me at least
another year or two to finish the algebraic calculations.
So I wrote C programs to perform
the algebra for me—and then wrote some more
to actually write the appendixes to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.johncostella.com/physics/Single-particle%20electrodynamics.pdf">my
  Ph.D. thesis</a>.
(My offer to post a floppy disk with the C code on it to anyone who emails a
request for it is still, I think, enforceable—I do still have the
code, but I no longer have any devices capable of reading or writing
floppy disks.)</p>

<p>By 1997, my postdoctoral research
position in theoretical particle physics had come
to an end, and to make ends meet I enrolled in a teaching qualification
and started teaching mathematics at a high school in Melbourne.
My “few years in teaching to get by”
ultimately stretched to nine years.</p>

<p>To keep myself sane, I kept doing some research in theoretical physics,
writing C programs to explore various ideas.
Then in the summer school vacation of 2000 I got an idea for deblurring images,
after borrowing a picture book from the local library about the
JFK assassination.
That led to a four-year hobby of studying the photographic evidence
of the assassination, writing increasingly sophisticated image processing</p></div>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, thinks Tether is issuing fake money. And that nothing short of an audit will prove the $30 billion in USDT the BVI-registered company has spewed out into the crypto markets thus far are even 74% backed. (Stuart Hoegner, the firm’s general counsel, claimed they were three-quarters backed in April 2019 court documents.)</p>



<p>Tether is a “criminal enterprise,” he bluntly told reporters on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/nouriel-roubini-reacting-to-teslas-big-bitcoin-buy-sec-should-investigate-market-manipulation">Coindesk TV</a>. In a 10-minute interview, Roubini predicted Tether’s looming demise, called for the SEC to look into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-twitter-elon-musk-has-mused-about-bitcoin-11612821103">Elon Musk’s bitcoin tweets,</a> and claimed that central bank digital currencies will spell the end for crypto. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Dr. Doom, as Roubini is called, talks quickly, doesn’t mince words, and his face barely changes expression. He has a reputation as a perpetual pessimist. Ask him a question, and he will give you a straightforward, often bleak, answer. Though he might argue, he is simply being a realist. </p>



<p>I am not sure why Coindesk had him on their program. Roubini hates bitcoin and his responses elicited laughter—though it wouldn’t be the first time. Roubini “sounded like a madman in 2006,” when he stood before economists at the International Monetary Fund and announced a crisis of solvency was brewing, IMF economist Prakash Loungani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html">told the NYT in August 2008.</a> “He was a prophet when he returned in 2007.”</p>



<p>Anyhow, I transcribed the talk only because I thought Roubini’s points made sense. He was interviewed by Coindesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn, Christine Lee, and Emily Parker.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: The narrative on bitcoin has shifted from a means of payment to a store of value for some. It is not so much used as a currency as a digital gold. Institutions and public companies are buying this thesis and we are seeing bitcoin hit records as a result. What do you make of this institutional and corporate interest in bitcoin, underlined by <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/08/tesla-spent-1-5b-in-clean-car-credits-on-bitcoin-the-filthiest-asset-imaginable/">Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin investment</a> on Monday?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: As you suggested, bitcoin and crypto is not a means of payment. It is not a currency. It is not a unit of account. Is not a scalable means of payment. It is not a single <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/numeraire.asp">numeraire.</a> Now, people say it is an asset. But think of it. What are assets? Assets like stocks, bonds and real estate give you income or give you some use, like real estate. And, therefore, they give you capital gain. Gold does not give you income but it has other uses,—industrial activity and jewelry—and therefore, has some value. It used to be used as a means of payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of bitcoin, it does not have any income. It doesn’t have any use. It doesn’t have any utility. So the value of it based on what? Based on no intrinsic value and purely a speculative bubble. That is why I argue that bitcoin, like all the other shitcoins, are worth zero. [Coindesk reporters giggle.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Actually, negative given the hogging of energy and the environmental cost. If there was a carbon tax on crypto, the value of these assets would be negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what is the fundamental value? What is the use? What is the utility that justifies the capital gain? None. It is a speculative bubble that is based on pump-and-dump, spoofing, wash trading and manipulation by Tether, which is a total scam.&nbsp;[More giggling from Coindesk crew.]</p>



<p>So, for institutional investors, saying we are going to invest in crypto doesn’t make any sense. You have a failing company that had a flat stock market like MicroStrategy for a decade, and its head was a coke addict who decided to bet the entire house on bitcoin. [CoinDesk crew really losing it.] That is irresponsible behavior. It is not gonna be any corporate head that is going to put his cash, as you point out, into something that is so volatile. You put your cash into something that is stable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for someone like Elon Musk who knows he has a market impact to manipulate to first, take an individual position to bitcoin, pump the price up, and then say that Tesla is invested. And Tesla doesn’t make money yet. It is also irresponsible and it is market manipulation.&nbsp;[Note: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/bitcoin-spikes-20percent-after-elon-musk-adds-bitcoin-to-his-twitter-bio.html">Musk was tweeting about BTC,</a> pushing up the price, before Telsa announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth.]</p>



<p>The SEC should be looking at people that have a market impact that manipulate the price of assets. That is also criminal behavior. It is totally a criminal enterprise. Tether is a criminal enterprise, and a bunch of whales and insiders are manipulating the price of bitcoins and other shitcoins day in and day out. That is a fact.</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: Dr. Roubini, always a ray of sunshine, of course. The question about Tether is this: We have known for a while now that it has been backed entirely by dollars. It is something like 70-some-odd percent. That came out a while ago. There have been questions about its backing for some time, for several years. Yet it is still trading on par with the US dollar. Conceivably, they have enough assets at least for a while to keep the peg going with the dollar. How much of a real worry is it for crypto if there is even a small run on tether?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, we don’t know if it is backed 70% or not. Their lawyer says 70% but we have no idea. It doesn’t mean any[thing] absolute independent audit of it. [A bit garbled here, but he is saying, outside of a third-party audit, which Tether has never had, there is no way of knowing what’s backing tethers.]</p>



<p>We also know they are really issuing, literally, at an exponential rate, new tethers. In the last year alone, something like 25 billion. And in the last few weeks, a billion per week. So it looks like they are getting desperate, and it is a typical Ponzi scheme, in which you maintain the value of something by issuing more of it and more of it and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lewitinn</strong>: How different is that from what is going on right now from the money printing happening in Washington?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: The money printing in Washington is happening at a rate that is much less than the issuance of fiat by Tether and other shitcoins. If you look at the chart of it, literally, the case of Tether is exponential. Second, central banks, if you know, their assets are matching their liabilities. For every dollar of currency in excess of reserves that are in the central bank balance sheet there is an asset, foreign reserve, or gold or treasury assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the idea that fiat currencies are not backed by anything is utterly false. If you look at the balance sheet of any central bank, there are assets and there are liabilities. And actually, there is a positive net worth most of the time. But in the case of Tether there is nothing backing it. Again, even 70% is not true. And we know that every fixed exchange rate that is based on not-full-backing and not fully collateralized eventually collapses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire monetary history, every fixed exchange that is not backed has collapsed. It is only a matter of time. And the trigger is gonna be when the indictments of Tether and Bitfinex are going to occur, and it is only a matter of time this year. Because we know that there are investigations occurring.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Parker</strong>: Let’s move to central bank digital currencies for a moment. We know that China is moving quite rapidly in this area. Do you think that the US dollar will remain the world reserve currency?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: I think that the Chinese are going to go ahead. [Sweden’s] Riksbank bank is going to go ahead. The [European Central Bank] is going to go ahead. And until now the US was behind the curve, but they realize that the Chinese had a plan to dominate the global financial system. It’s their e-commerce. It is their own platform of private payment systems like AliPay and WeChat Pay and that is going to be the e-RNB. And it is only a matter of time before we are going to phase out cash all over the world. And if the US wants to maintain the role of the US dollar as a major global reserve currency, they will have to move to an e-dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem with that is that people get excited in the crypto world when central banks end up talking about a central bank digital currency. A CBDC, first of all, has nothing to do with blockchain. It is going to be private. It is going to be centralized. It is going to be permissioned. And it is going to be based on a bunch of trusted authority verifying transactions. </p>



<p>It has nothing to do with blockchain. It has nothing to do with crypto. And as a payment system, it is going to dominate, not only crypto, which has absolutely no payment services, but also any private form of payment system that is digital, from credit cards to bank deposits to AliPay to WeChat pay to Venmo to Square to PayPal, and so on. Because it is going to be cheap, it is going to be instantaneous clearing and settlement. It is going to be a system that is going to dominate any form of private money</p>



<p>If and when a central bank currency is going to be introduced, the problem is going to be that any form of private digital payment system is going to be crowded out, starting with crypto, which doesn’t have any payment service in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lee</strong>: Dr. Roubini, it sounds like you believe that the technology underlying bitcoin is at least sound and that governments and central banks around the world will adopt it, and if that is the case, what happens to privacy? And you also mentioned something about negative rates becoming the norm. Tell us about that?</p>



<p><strong>Roubini</strong>: First of all, I said the opposite of the technology. The central bank digital currencies will not be based on blockchain. They are going to be private, not public. They are going to be centralized, not decentralized. They are going to be permissioned, not permissionless. They are going to be a bunch of central banks and private banks that are trusted verifiers of the transaction, rather than being trustless. So the technology is not going to be blockchain. It is not going to be crypto. That is my point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, the advantage of having a central bank digital …</p></div></article></div>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-header.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Self-driving Vehicle"></p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, we’ve started to see computers take to the street, and lucky for us, it’s been mostly to help us get deliveries or transport us around. These robots are a combination of sensors, compute units, and some form of connectivity. They have personalities, and if you look closely, two cute eyes on <a href="https://serve.postmates.com/">Postmates’ Serve</a> that provide it with stereo vision to navigate the streets.  While ‘Serve’ is fully equipped to navigate the streets, even the smartest robots need help from a human sometimes.</p>

<p>Many of us have taken accessing computers remotely for granted, despite the fact that our production servers are running behind NAT.  This has been made possible by SREs  who set up public endpoints and bastion hosts, and configure identity-based authentication as we’ve covered in a previous post called <em><a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">How to SSH properly</a></em>. But what if your computer is on the move? What happens if you have thousands of them in thousands of cities? How do you provide access for system-level debugging? Which technical hurdles will you have to overcome?</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-1.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Robot"></p>

<h3 id="connectivity-and-the-network">Connectivity and the Network</h3>

<p>We are lucky to have a range of connectivity options available to IoT devices, from high speed LTE connections to new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRaWAN</a> networks. Once connected to a network, the next step is to get access to the device. This post will focus on using SSH by following best practices. Earlier, we’ve outlined how to configure the local ssh-agent to connect to a Bastion Host. This method works well, but unless you start off with a very good naming convention, it becomes much harder to find that one robot stuck in Berlin at 3am.</p>

<p>We’ve taken the best practices of accessing systems and rolled them into our open source project, Teleport. Teleport was designed as a drop-in <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/introducing-teleport-4-point-3-modern-replacement-for-openssh/">replacement for OpenSSH</a>, but with a focus on fleets of servers (clusters) where individual nodes such as self-driving trucks (or regular AWS instances) can be located anywhere in the world. The certificate authority and the audit log are deployed in secure networks with only the proxy available to the public internet. Let’s dive a bit deeper into it.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-into-a-self-driving-truck">SSH into a Self-driving Truck</h3>

<p>While the technical details of delivery robots are often kept under wraps, we know other people have gone to great lengths to be able to <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/04/howto-ssh-to-your-iot-device-when-its-behind-a-firewall-or-on-a-3g-dongle/">SSH into lamp posts</a> with David’s Awesome <a href="https://blogs.wcode.org/2015/01/playable-city-award-2014-shadowing-part-1-hardware/">Shadowing Project</a>. The same approach could be applied to self-driving robots using a reverse SSH tunnel, but this method only scales so far, and it requires more than 50 steps to set up.</p>

<p>A reverse SSH tunnel is an SSH connection initiated by the host (self-driving vehicle) to the proxy. This connection is maintained for as long as the host is online, and if an engineer or an Ansible script wants to connect to the vehicle, they connect to the proxy, which in turn proxies the connection through the tunnel to the host who initiated it.</p>

<p>We had many <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/803">long standing requests</a> to support reverse tunnels, and with OSS Teleport  4.0, we’ve made setting up and managing these reverse tunnels simpler. This can be set up on the node in a couple of quick steps.</p>

<p>On the robot/lamp post/self-driving truck, the Teleport daemon will be installed and will then dial back to a central Teleport Cluster.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">$ teleport start --roles=node
 --token=n92bb958ce97f761da978d08c35c54a5c --auth-server=teleport-proxy.example.com</code></pre></div>
<p>Extra configuration options can be set up to add labels and extra supporting metadata to help the operator.</p>

<p>After connecting to the proxy, the ‘node’ - in our case a single Raspberry Pi - will show in the Teleport web UI and you can see it by using the CLI client as well:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ls
Node Name             Address         Labels
--------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------

Truck-1821             ⟵ Tunnel      arch=Linux, hostname=postmate-serve-342145
                                      uptime=up 0 minutes, 📍=SF
                                      📶=5G</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m now able to SSH into the node using it’s node name.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">➜  ~ tsh ssh truck-1821
$truck-1821:~</code></pre></div>
<p>This has a few benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>You can ssh into truck-1821 using it’s nodename, meaning you no longer have to worry about IP addresses or having to setup Dynamic DNS at its location.</li>
<li>Labels can provide both system and location data. This makes managing a large fleet of devices much easier.</li>
<li>It allows for one centralized access system for ARM, Linux, and MacOS applications.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-moving-kubernetes-clusters-in-a-self-driving-truck">Accessing moving Kubernetes Clusters in a self driving Truck</h3>

<p>Moving up in scale, we’ve started to see more computers move to the edge, and some have speculated that this could be the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/">end of cloud computing</a>. For context, a self driving truck generates 10 gigabytes of data per mile. Some self-driving companies have published how they manage and set up network infrastructure. Cruise has a <a href="https://medium.com/cruise/container-platform-networking-kubernetes-e888a07407ab">great blog</a> for anyone interested in the topic.</p>

<p>As these systems become more complex, having more compute and extra redundancy running a container-orchestration system makes sense to scale the workloads associated with many gigabytes of data every mile. Yet for operators, these systems can be increasingly difficult to update, debug, and access. Providing access opens Pandora’s box of issues. If robots or humans can access machines, there needs to be an audit trail, approval workflows, and full visibility into what’s been run on these clusters.</p>

<p>These problems can be easy to solve on a small scale, but become increasingly difficult with 100+ Clusters. Combining a large cluster with hundreds of employees can create extra operational complexity. We have had many users facing the same problem and by using external identity providers combined with a flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC), They get access quickly and securely.</p>

<p>In this quick example we’ll show how a fictional company has deployed multiple kubernetes clusters into trucks, yet still require a centralized command and control over the cluster.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-2.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a Truck"></p>

<p>Teleport provides users two options for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, it can be run as a proxy outside the cluster or deployed inside a cluster. We recommend deploying inside a cluster, then registering the cluster back to a central root cluster using t<a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/">rusted clusters</a>.</p>

<p>All of these features are available in the OSS version of Teleport, using Github as an SSO provider. We’ve more information on our <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes-access/">Kubernetes integration here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/iot-3.png" width="100%" alt="SSH into a K8s"></p>

<h3 id="connect-to-any-computer-anywhere">Connect to any computer anywhere</h3>

<p>No matter where you run a computer, be it a small home lab, a small robot or many thousands of self-driving trucks, these patterns can be used to get secure access quickly. The use of reverse tunnels to access infrastructure can be very powerful when you don’t have full control over the network.</p>

      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

This article discusses the choices and tradeoffs we made while standardizing the IAM policy format for access via SQL and shows off the potential of IAM Policy analysis when normalized.</p><br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span>                                        </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span>     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span>,</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span>,</span><span>                  </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span>                      </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>                          </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span>                                     </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>   </span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:SecureTransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span> </span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span> </span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"aws:securetransport"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>"false"</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Deny"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Principal"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"AWS"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::vandelay-ind-bucket/*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Sid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"MustBeEncryptedInTransit"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br><h2 id="why-be-normal--">Why be Normal  ?</h2><p>AWS IAM policies can have multiple representations that mean the same thing. Converting to a standard, machine-readable format makes them easier to search, analyze, join with other data and to calculate differences.</p><p>When working through the normalization process for an API, we generally work with 3 forms of each response:</p><ol><li>The original <strong>source</strong> form, verbatim (or as verbatim as the API allows). This is usually a string, including whitespace, comments, etc. The value of the keeping the source format varies - it's usually important for YAML but less important for JSON, for example. </li><li>The <strong>object</strong> form - A 'usable' form where the source (which is usually a string) is transformed into an object that can be manipulated in a standard way. Such transformation may be lossy - duplicate keys may be removed, comments are typically not included, etc. For steampipe, this format is typically <code>jsonb</code>.</li><li>A <strong>standard</strong> form - A single, canonical form that objects are converted to. The <strong>source</strong> and <strong>object</strong> forms may allow multiple syntaxes to represent a single semantic meaning. In such cases, converting all of these equivalent syntaxes to a single format simplifies and optimizes searching, comparing, and analyzing the object. </li></ol><p>Note that which forms are important vary by API, object, etc. For AWS IAM policies, Steampipe currently returns the object form (in the <code>policy</code> column) and the standardized form as <code>policy_std</code>. Because the source form is JSON and it sufficiently similar to the object form, we do not currently include it. </p><p>Many of the AWS IAM policy elements in the object form may be single elements or arrays. To search these elements, you don't just need to look for values, you would need to evaluate the <strong>structure</strong> of the result as well. For example, let's says you want to search for policies that allow the <code>s3:DeleteBucket</code> action. Without the standard form, you would need to look for both cases:</p><ul><li>Where the action is a string, and has value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div><br></li><li>Where the action is an array, and the array includes the value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:CreateBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul><p>In fact, the real world situation is even more complex - The action value may be any case, the resource may also be either string or array, etc. By converting policies to a single, standardized format, Steampipe makes it easier to find what you are looking for regardless of the source format.</p><h2 id="baseline-normalization-rules">Baseline Normalization Rules</h2><p>The general guidelines for building the standard policy are:</p><ol><li>Normalize the structure. In IAM policies, many elements may optionally contain either a single item, or an array of items, in these cases <strong>convert any single item values into a single item  array</strong>.</li><li>Standardize the case. For values or keys that are case insensitive, <strong>convert to consistent case (lower case)</strong>.</li><li>Order the elements consistently. Generally, the order of array elements is not important in the IAM policy, so <strong>sort array elements alphabetically</strong> to make them easier to read and easier to to compare/diff. </li></ol><h2 id="applicability-for-each-aws-iam-policy-element">Applicability for each AWS IAM Policy Element</h2><p>The devil is in the details, and so it is worthwhile to consider each policy element individually.</p><h3 id="statement"><code>Statement</code></h3><p>A policy can contain a single <code>Statement</code> object or an array of <code>Statement</code> objects, thus the following are equivalent:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:PutObject"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The standard form will always convert the <code>Statement</code> to the array format.</p><h3 id="action-and-notaction"><code>Action</code> and <code>NotAction</code></h3><p>Like <code>Statement</code>, a policy may represent a single <code>Action</code> as a string, or one or more actions as an array.

In the standard form, we convert all actions to <strong>lower case</strong> to simplify equivalency and matching operations. An argument could be made for camel case as well, as the documentation most frequently refers to them in camel case; however, we chose lower case because it is simple and unambiguous. This also has the benefit of avoiding stylistic choices that can arise in camel case (e.g. <code>IpAddress</code> v/s <code>IPAddress</code>).</p><p>Actions may appear in any order.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past couple of months, we planned and implemented a move from a Slack group to a Discord server. There are many pros and cons of both platforms, and in fact, we covered them in detail, along with Discourse, in our blog post <a href="https://orbit.love/blog/slack-vs-discord-vs-discourse/">Slack vs Discord vs Discourse: The best tool for your community</a>.</p><p>But as our community grew, we began feeling the limitations of Slack as a community platform, and generally felt the need for more flexibility. That’s why we made the switch to Discord.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share our playbook for the move, along with several ideas and gotchas for anyone else considering setting up Discord for their own community.</p><h2>Early results</h2><p>As of this writing, the total number of members in Discord is smaller than the user count in Slack, but it’s catching up fast.</p><p>In that sense, we did take a short-term hit in terms of the gross user count. But as you know, not all user accounts represent actual engaged humans, so we’ve paid closer attention to the frequency and quality of conversation on the new platform, more than the simple total count of members.</p><p>Since the migration, we’ve received positive feedback form the community, and our community activity overall has increased, with more conversations happening across more channels.</p><p>In sum, the move has proven a success on all accounts, and I’m glad we made the move now rather than in the future.</p><p>Alright, how did we do it?</p><p><strong>Here’s the TLDR on our process</strong></p><ul><li>Invite community input and buy-in before making any moves</li><li>Design your Discord server well before migration day</li><li>Create incentives for early adopters</li><li>Phase the rollout</li><li>Bootstrap the initial interactions</li></ul><p>Before digging into the specifics of each step, let’s look at a few key points that drove our decision in the first place.</p><h2>Why we migrated our community from Slack to Discord</h2><p>There were several reasons, from tactical issues related to message history, to higher level concepts, like wanting more flexibility as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>No message limits</strong></h3><p>Most communities, including ours, are on Slack’s Free plan, which only allows you to see and search for the 10,000 most recent messages. More specifically:</p><blockquote>Members can send unlimited messages in Slack, but only the most recent 10,000 can be searched and viewed in your workspace. (<a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115002422943-Message-file-and-app-limits-on-the-free-version-of-Slack#:~:text=Message%20visibility%20limit,your%20direct%20messages%20when%20searching.">source</a>)</blockquote><p>10k may sound like a lot, but by the time your community hits 250–300 members, you’ll blow right past the limit. We certainly did.</p><p>Discord enforces no such messaging limit, which means we don’t have to worry about losing context and conversations as the community grows.</p><h3><strong>Easy voice chat and screen share</strong></h3><p>In addition to the usual chat channels, Discord offers voice channels, which can be used for everything from casual chats to support to live discussions. These rooms also offer one-click video and screen sharing, making impromptu conversations fast and easy.</p><h3><strong>Moderation tools</strong></h3><p>As the community grows, moderation and permissions will become more important. Discord offers better capabilities along these lines.</p><h3><strong>More flexibility for everyone</strong></h3><p>Discord offers more options for channels and groups, allowing for a fine-grain architecture of channels. For example, we’ll be able to spin-up private chat and voice channels for customers inside of the server, while creating standalone public channels for events and more.</p><h2>Our playbook from migrating from Slack to Discord</h2><p>If you decide to make the move, here are my recommendations for planning and implementing the migration.</p><h3>Secure community buy-in</h3><p>As we thought about switching to a new platform, it was important for us to get community input and buy-in. After all, our members had been sharing ideas with each other and getting support in the Slack group for months.</p><p>And ultimately, there are way more community members than there are Orbit team members, so we didn’t want to just unilaterally impose the change.</p><p>Most agree that transparency should be a core value of any community, and this seemed like a great way to put that idea into action.</p><p>To do that, we drafted a proposal outlining our rationale, and left the Google Doc open to comment, so folks were able to add questions and ideas right in the doc. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFHhZyyYmiIHNufYpS6fX7gUMEJVo3FM0Y0RZa7DuDo/edit?usp=sharing">Check out the proposal (now read-only) here ››</a></p><p>We then shared a post in the existing channel giving folks a heads-up.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3c43a7f63c2ba85cc4393525b0a25be1de2584fd-1999x796.png" alt="Announcement in Slack" title="Announcement in Slack"></p><p>The comments were generally positive, with some asking questions about longevity and discoverability of discussions.</p><p>While we worked to secure community buy-in, we also got to work setting up our Discord server.</p><h3>Configure the Discord server for your needs</h3><p>Discord offers loads of flexibility for configuring your server, but with power comes complexity. In other words, there are lots of ways to fine-tune your server, but more thought and effort is required versus spinning-up a Slack instance.</p><p>By the way, in Discord world, <strong>"server" is just Discord's word for "workspace."</strong></p><p>To help us wrangle the moving parts of our server, we worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/domitriusclark/">Domitrius Clark</a>, who’s helped set up Discord servers for communities like Apollo GraphQL, Black Tech Pipeline, Open Sauced, Streaming in Color, and Rebuild Black Business, and for events like GraphQL Summit.</p><p>Working with Dom gave our team a <em>huge</em> head-start.</p><p>There are many things to keep in mind with your server setup, and the specifics probably warrant a separate post.</p><p>That said, let’s go into the weeds a bit on these points, since a broad understanding here will provide helpful context for the rest of the post.</p><p><strong>Roles basics</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101">Read the Discord docs on Roles ››</a></p><p>On a Discord server, permissions are associated with roles. A member can have multiple roles, affording them different abilities to do things like send messages, create channels, use voice and video, invite other members, and more.</p><p>Practically, here are few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Roles are visible on member profiles, and, optionally, in the sidebar.</li><li>Channel permissions are associated with roles as well.</li><li>Roles are created and assigned manually.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the high-level roles and permissions we created:</p><p><strong>Orbit Employee</strong></p><p>This role is reserved for members of the Orbit team. With this role, all community members know immediately who actually works for Orbit.</p><p>From a safety perspective, this means it’s impossible for a nefarious actor to impersonate us. More often, though, it just means folks know who to turn to for help.</p><p>You can also configure roles to allow anyone to @mention everyone with that role. This is another quick and easy way to get the attention of all users with a certain Role.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/a664ea022409219c9d0d41f5902e2c23dba9fac8-1282x144.png" alt="Screenshot of the @Orbit Employee role" title="The Employee role"></p><p>In addition to a special color for our usernames, Orbit team members always appear at the top of the users list:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/787c8fe6818a0a5658631f4d2523ea0588a57eb9-570x532.png" alt="Screenshot of the user's list " title="User's List "></p><p><br><strong>Beta Program</strong></p><p>We work with a small subset of the community for quick feedback and iteration on new features and ideas. To facilitate easy discussion, we created a Beta Program category with two channels.</p><p>We also created a Beta Program role, which has access to the private channels.</p><p>With an understanding of Roles, let’s talk about the next key concepts: categories and channels.</p><p><strong>Setting up Categories and Channels</strong></p><p>Like Slack, Discord lets you create public and private channels, and group them into Categories. The two types of channels are chat and voice.</p><p><strong>The interesting thing about voice channels is that they can also turn into streaming and live video channels with a click or two.</strong> This facilitates super simple meetings and screen sharing, which can be great for general hangouts or to quickly troubleshoot an issue.</p><p>At the outset, we created several public and private categories and channels.</p><p>Our Core categories include #random, #general, and #orbit-model, where folks discuss concepts about the Orbit Model. There are also two special channel types in Core.</p><p>The first is #announcements, which is a read-only channel where we share product and community updates. The second is #voice-chat, where anyone can drop-in for an impromptu conversation. This is also where we hangout on community game days.</p><p>When someone joins the server, they land in the #getting-started channel, which is read-only:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/ff5173f4f8871251e7f7d985259b384f5613cdc2-1936x542.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord server welcome message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>We encourage folks to say Hello in #intros. Here are a few other key categories and channels:</p><p><strong>Product &amp; Support</strong> - channels for getting help and for talking about potential features</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> - for sharing integrations and apps built on top of Orbit</p><p><strong>Beta Program</strong> - a private category for folks in, well, the beta program</p><p>With your channels in place, there’s one more configuration choice you probably want to consider.</p><p><strong>Configure your server as a Community Server</strong></p><p>Discord offers a special designation for community servers, which unlocks several features highly relevant for you if you’re reading this article. This setting is not enabled automatically, but easy to do in Server Settings.</p><p>The first benefit is <strong>Membership Screening</strong>, which lets you require new members to verify their email for joining, and asks them to accept your guidelines before entering. This screen is fairly customizable and lets you spell out your expectations for behavior on your server. Here’s what ours looks like:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/579265a0e3294e9273fcee7679ab3c5aa7f9e292-1730x1702.png" alt="Screenshot of the Membership Screening dialogue " title="Membership Screening"></p><p>Additionally, community servers offer a customizable <strong>welcome screen</strong>, which lets you set context and point new members in the right direction upon joining. As your community grows, you’ll add more categories and channels, so the welcome screen will help reduce any feeling of overwhelm for new users joining for the first time. Here’s ours:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/b1408cc4fada97b8c676e1f45981a70b96abfdc6-1194x1548.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Discord Welcome Message" title="Welcome Message"></p><p>Alright, you now have many of the key Disord concepts in mind. Let’s return to the implementation plan.</p><h3>Create incentives for early adopters</h3><p>To kickstart the move to Discord, we planned to offer several incentives to encourage early adopters to join us on Discord.</p><p><strong>First, we created a limited-run sticker commemorating the move.</strong> To get one, members had to join the Discord by February 1. Turns out, people like stickers! Here's our space canary, commemorating the migration 👇</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/3ad93f042804b265386f46417ab5fceacb772272-2400x812.png" alt="Illustration of a canary in a space suit " title="Canary sticker"></p><p>Second, <strong>we hosted a community game day in #voice-chat,</strong> and invited community members to join us for a few rounds of <a href="http://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>Since about 2017, I've been using <a href="https://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> almost daily as my console emulator of choice. There were a few key reasons why I gravitated towards it, and why it has stuck around for so long, but few issues have now led me elsewhere.</p><h2 id="would-i-still-recommend-cmder">Would I still recommend Cmder?</h2><p>After so many years of using Cmder, I actually still recommend it to newer analysts, people who migrate computers a lot, or folks who don't have administrative rights on their work computers. For anyone who is a little more settled in their development careers though, the question gets a little more complicated. Let's dive into some of the positives and negatives that in the end led to me searching for alternatives.</p><h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3><ul><li>It had a portable version! This was especially important since I was not allowed to have admin rights on my work computer and wanted the same terminal console everywhere.</li><li>It came with git and ssh out of the box.</li><li>The default theme settings looked pretty good particularly in comparison to PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mridgers/clink">Clink</a> and the Git aware prompt were new to me at the time and really interesting.</li></ul><h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3><p>You might be thinking this all sounds great! It has some handy features to make it feel more like Linux and required minimal configuration! What went wrong?</p><ul><li>Speed - Cmder often feels slow. Really slow. Admittedly my work computer has a terrible hybrid drive which entirely negates the otherwise powerful machine, but when Windows Update runs in the background, I can barely open Cmder or run basic commands like <code>ls</code>. While admittedly not nearly as bad, it also feels slow on my home laptop and desktop even though they both have SSDs.</li><li>Settings Menu - Cmder offers a lot of customizability, but it presents so many options that I found it difficult to find what I wanted or to discover new features. As I got more comfortable setting up my own command line and dev tools, the sensible defaults that drew me to Cmder in the first place eventually led it to be a little more frustrating later on.</li></ul><h2 id="enter-alacritty">Enter Alacritty</h2><p>Alacritty initally made waves on Hacker News back in 2017 for being a fast GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust. It was fast, but didn't have some basic features like tabs or scrollback. I initially dismissed it since it also did not have Windows support, but I came across it while searching for a Cmder replacement.</p><p>Many of the initial positives for Cmder did not matter to me any more, and Alacritty addressed the negatives too. The minimal configuration Alacritty offers is through a YAML file, but the options are all clear and there are few enough that it is easy to look them up. It feels fast, even when working with files quickly in VIM something that was especially annoying in Cmder. I needed to install Git and OpenSSH anyway for other tools, so it didn't bother me not having it built in. I finally knew enough to set up a Git aware prompt myself.</p><h3 id="configuring-alacritty">Configuring Alacritty</h3><p>By default, Alacritty looks very plain out of the box.</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-Base-Opening.png"><figcaption>Alacritty Defaults</figcaption></figure><p>For a full list of configuration options, see the <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty.yml">example configuration file</a>, with all options commented out. For now, creating the config file:</p><pre><code>mkdir $env:APPDATA\alacritty
nvim alacritty.yml</code></pre><p>I started out by setting up the window defaults, fixing the font, and introducing a hint of transparency.</p><pre><code>window:
  title: SuperFun🚄
  dimensions:
    columns: 100
    lines: 30

font:
  normal:
    family: 'Source Code Pro for Powerline
 
background_opacity: 0.95</code></pre><p>I also copied the <code>gruvbox_dark</code> theme colors from the <a href="https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme">Alacritty Themes GitHub page</a>, since it is the theme I use for all of my other software. </p><p>Already we have an immediate improvement (in my eyes):</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-after-Visual-Configuration.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Source Code Pro, Transparency, and Gruvbox Dark</figcaption></figure><p>Next, let's introduce a few functional changes to make it easier to use on my laptop:</p><pre><code>selection:
  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.
  save_to_clipboard: true
  
# Updating to PowerShell 7 (added to my PATH variable as pwsh)
shell:
  program: pwsh

# Paste text with right click, instead of the default middle mouse wheel
# click
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Right, action: PasteSelection }</code></pre><p>And that's it! If all you wanted was a fast terminal emulator, this is pretty much all there is to it. There is some remaining work to do though to make it look especially good and add back in a Git aware prompt.</p><h3 id="powershell-oh-my-posh-and-posh-git">Powershell, Oh-My-Posh and Posh-Git</h3><p>Since Alacritty is just a terminal emulator, it still needs a shell to run inside it. Despite a pretty good experience with Clink in Cmder, I decided it was time to try out PowerShell. Microsoft has released it on MacOS and Linux too now, and honestly, I just felt like trying something new. Furthermore, WSL does not work well on my work computer, and WSL2 is not available on it yet at all. The new Windows Terminal looked interesting, but the Windows Store at work is limited to only a couple apps approved by the IT department, of which it is not one.</p><p>To make PowerShell look a little more attractive, you can install some <a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">P</a><a href="https://github.com/powerline/fonts">owerline fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">Oh-My-Posh</a>, a prompt theming engine for PowerShell (it was designed for ConEmu intially, but it works on Alacritty too).</p><pre><code>Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser</code></pre><p>Then, if you add the four lines below to your PowerShell profile, it will auto-import everything as soon as you open Alacritty. Rather than finding the profile file, you can just <code>nvim $PROFILE</code> instead.</p><pre><code>Import-Module posh-git
Import-Module oh-my-posh
Set-Theme Agnoster
$DefaultUser = $Env:UserName # Hide the username, since I only use one account</code></pre><p>I didn't seem to need it, but if you are running the PowerShell Core, you will apparently need this too:</p><pre><code>Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck</code></pre><p>So what does this all this work actually result in?</p><figure><img src="https://justjensen.co/content/images/2020/05/Alacritty-with-Oh-My-Posh.png"><figcaption>Alacritty with Oh-My-Posh</figcaption></figure><p>I think it looks good! And more importantly, it is faster to load than Cmder (even with Anaconda and Oh-My-Posh), more responsive, and styled to my own preferences. Hopefully this inspired you to switch up your setup too!</p><p>P.S. You might need to initialize Anaconda in Powershell for environments to work correctly:</p><pre><code>conda init powershell</code></pre><p>Note that this will slow down your PowerShell boot time significantly (about 1.5 seconds for me on Powershell v7.0.1 on my laptop SSD). I have not figured out how to only load it when I run <code>activate base</code> unfortunately.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="#GC-proof-resource-class">Link
</a></p>
<p>Class destructors have painful <a href="#The-trouble-with-class-destructors">limitations</a> when called by the GC.
</p>
<p>But there is a way to make a class holding a resource that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>works with scoped ownership (<code>std.typecons.RefCounted</code>, <code>std.typecons.Unique</code>, <code>std.typecons.Scoped</code>)
</li>
<li>works with manual release (<code>object.destroy</code>)
</li>
<li>warns when the GC call the destructor and then release the resource, which is <em>coincidental correctness</em> and dangerous to rely on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea behind the <strong>GC-proof resource class</strong> is to check why the destructor was called and act accordingly.
</p>
<pre><code>class MyGCProofResource
{
    void* handle;

    this()
    {
        // acquire resource
        handle = create_handle();
    }

    ~this()
    {
        // Important bit.
        // Here we verify that the GC isn't responsible
        // for releasing the resource, which is dangerous.
        import core.memory;
        assert(!GC.inFinalizer, "Error: clean-up of MyGCProofResource incorrectly" ~
                                " depends on destructors called by the GC");

        // release resource
        free_handle(handle);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You'll get a clear message whenever you rely on the GC to release resources.
</p>
<p>This idiom was first introduced in the <a href="https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm">GFM</a> library.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Don't-use-@property">Link
</a></p>
<p>The current agreement on best practices with regards to <code>@property</code> is to <strong>not use it.</strong>
</p>
<p><code>@property</code> does very little and you can always avoid it.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Parallel-foreach">Link
</a></p>
<p>This performs a parallel loop with a default task pool.
</p>
<pre><code>import core.atomic;
import std.parallelism;
import std.range;

void main()
{
    shared(int) A = 0;
    foreach(n; iota(2000).parallel)
    {

<p>DUB is an essential piece of the modern D language experience. <strong>However,</strong> that experience doesn't include <em>"Running unit tests with optimizations"</em> by default.
</p>
<p>So, how do you avoid surprises in production? What would Kent Beck do?
</p>
<p><strong>In this post, we unleash the jaleously-guarded secret behind the most successful organizations in the world: running unittests with optimizations ON and OFF.</strong>

<p>Create a new build type with the proper flags. This is also a good way to get to know the discreet <code>"buildTypes"</code>.

    "unittest-opt": 
    {
        "buildOptions": ["unittests", "optimize", "inline"]
    }
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Because it doesn't have a</strong> <code>-release</code> <strong>flag</strong>, <a href="#So-what-does--release-do,-exactly?">asserts will still be enabled</a>. Hence, the <code>unittest</code> content is here.
</p>
<p>(Please, don't call this configuration <code>unittest-release</code>. Because flag <code>-release</code> not being there is the one important thing. This increase the confusion between "release" and "optimizations").

</div><div><p><a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">Link
</a></p>
<p>It just happens that in D you can't use <code>new</code> to get a pointer to a newly allocated static array.
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

    // This line does not compile!
    // Error: new can only create structs, dynamic arrays or class objects, not int[4]'s
    auto t = new T; 
}
</code></pre><p><em>"You can only call new with structs, dynamic arrays, and class objects"</em> says the compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated:</strong> actually the compiler is lying a bit, since it is possible to allocate a single (builtin type) value on the heap:
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    int* p = new int;  // Works
}
</code></pre><p>But this can't be with static arrays, despite them being <a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">value types</a>. Doesn't that sound like an inconsistency? Something that would have to be <strong>explained.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>The reasoning for <code>new</code> and static arrays was probably that you rarely really want to allocate a static array on the heap; it could just as well be a slice.
</p>
<p><strong>So there is no syntax to do this</strong>.<br>When you do write <code>new int[4]</code> this will instead return an <code>int[]</code> <em>slice</em> with a length of 4, which adds the benefits of holding a length.
</p>
<pre><code>writeln(typeof(new int[4]).stringof); // output: "int[]"

auto arr = new int[4];
writeln(arr.length); // output: "4"
arr ~= 42;
writeln(arr.length); // output: "5"
</code></pre><p>So far, so good. 
</p>
<p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">It gets weirder</a> whenever <code>shared</code>, <code>const</code> and <code>immutable</code> get introduced...
</p>
<h2 id="do-it-anyway"> Do it anyway</h2>
<p>If for some reason you really need a <em>static</em> array allocated on the heap instead of a slice, you can do it anyway by using <code>std.experimental.allocator</code> (or its DUB equivalent <a href="https://code.dlang.org/packages/stdx-allocator">stdx-allocator</a>):
</p>
<pre><code>import std.experimental.allocator;

void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

 // T* t = new T;                 // Won't work.
    T* t = theAllocator.make!T;   // Fine!
    assert((*t).length == 4);     // Safe too.

    (*t)[1] = 42;                 // Needs pointer dereference and parentheses before use.
    assert(*t == [0, 42, 0, 0]);  // Features default initialization.
    
 // (*t) ~= 43; // Error: cannot append type int to type int[4]

<p>A <em>Voldemort type</em> is simply a type that can't be named by the user.
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-from-ae-utils-graphics"> An example from <code>ae.utils.graphics</code>:</h2>
<pre><code>template procedural(alias formula)
{
    alias fun = binaryFun!(formula, "x", "y");
    alias Color = typeof(fun(0, 0));

    // Returning auto is necessary here.
    // Procedural can't be named outside of the procedural function.
    auto procedural()
    {
        struct Procedural
        {
            auto ref Color opIndex(int x, int y)
            {
                return fun(x, y);
            }
        }
        return Procedural();
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Outside of the <code>procedural</code> function of this <a href="#Eponymous-templates">eponymous template</a>, there is no way to name <code>Procedural</code>. Therefore, <strong>Voldemort types can only be passed around in auto variables or auto returns.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>Hiding information about types. Because the user can't name or instantiate Voldemort types at will, expressions in a Voldemort lazy computation chain can change types without changing user code.
</p>
<p>Voldemort types were promoted and named by Andrei Alexandrescu. They are typically used in chains of lazy computations, like ranges.

</div><div><p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">Link
</a></p>
<p>When a slice is created with <code>new</code> and a type qualifier, the qualifier applies to <em>pointed elements</em> <br>instead of the whole slice as would be expected.
</p>
<pre><code>import std.stdio;

void main(string[] args)
{
    // Output: "const(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new const(int[4])).stringof);
    
    // Output: "immutable(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new immutable(int[4])).stringof);
    
    // Output: "shared(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new shared(int[4])).stringof);
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> this syntax <a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">doesn't return pointers to static arrays</a> but indeed return a slice.
</p>
<p><em>This peculiarity was emphasized at DConf 2018 by Andrei Alexandrescu.</em>
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">Link
</a></p>
<p><em>(Note: on this whole website, with "static arrays" we mean fixed-size arrays, not arrays declared with</em> <code>static</code><em>).</em>
</p>
<p>It's important to note that D static arrays are value types.
</p>
<pre><code>void addFour(int[16] arr)
{
    arr[] += 4;           // Only the local version is modified.
}

void main()
{
    int[16] a;
    addFour(a);           // a is passed by value on the stack, not by pointer.
    assert(a[0] == 0);
}
</code></pre><p>That makes such declaration a trap when porting functions from C or C++.
</p>
<h2 id="static-arrays-convert-implicitely-into-slices"> Static arrays convert implicitely into slices!</h2>
<p>To pass static arrays by reference, either write a function taking a slice or use ref.
</p>
<pre><code>void addFive(ref int[16] arr)
{
    arr[] += 5;           // Caller parameter modified.
}

void addSix(int[] arr)

We invest in writing tests for every bug fix and new feature being implemented and in peer-reviewed merge requests. Good developers learn from experience that investing time into good test coverage actually allows them to move faster as a team in the long run. In addition to having good test coverage, writing human-readable code and tests is equally important. Personally, my feeling of having to work with a neatly nested and organized test suite that is set up, <em>but</em> extremely difficult to follow is almost comparable to having to walk through a wild maze to find something that is not very worthwhile. Unfortunately, when you're coding, you have to deal with this every time.</p><div data-css="tve-u-1778dede305"><p><span><picture data-id="656545" data-init-width="1000" data-init-height="1481" title="the-maze-runner-poster" data-width="602" data-height="892"><source data-srcset="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.webp 1000w,https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-203x300.webp 203w,https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-691x1024.webp 691w,https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-768x1137.webp 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" type="image/webp"><source data-srcset="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.jpg 1000w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-203x300.jpg 203w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-691x1024.jpg 691w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-768x1137.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.jpg" data-src="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.jpg" data-id="656545" data-init-width="1000" data-init-height="1481" title="the-maze-runner-poster" data-width="602" data-height="892" alt="The Maze Runner" height="892" width="602" data-srcset="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.jpg 1000w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-203x300.jpg 203w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-691x1024.jpg 691w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-768x1137.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" srcset="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster.jpg 1000w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-203x300.jpg 203w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-691x1024.jpg 691w, https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-maze-runner-poster-768x1137.jpg 768w"></picture></span></p><p>Better as a movie than an approach to testing code.</p></div><div><p>Since I came from a Ruby on Rails background, I spent years using RSpec to write my tests. While coding with Elixir and using ExUnit to write tests nowadays, I caught myself finding ways to nest RSpec "context" blocks inside each other. Let's look at a simple example: you wanted to build a chef robot to prepare dinners based on the leftover food in your fridge. Depending on what's available in your kitchen, it'll choose how to prepare the appropriate dishes.</p><h3>Nested contexts in RSpec</h3><p>This is how I would write TDD tests for this scenario in RSpec.</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">ruby
  describe "make_dish_from_left_over" do
    context "with dishes that are served cold" do
    # before: set up cold dishes
    # ...
    # end
    context "seasoning available" do
      # before: set up seasoning
      # ...
      # end
      expect(add_seasoning).to be_truthy
    end
    context "extra protein available" do
      # before: set up extra protein
      # ...
      # end
      expect(add_protein).to be_truthy
    end
  end

  context "with dishes that are served hot" do
      # before: set up hot dishes
      # ...
      # end
    context "microwave available" do
      # before: set up microwave
      # ...
      # end
      expect(warm_up_by_microwave).to be_truthy
    end
    context "microwave NOT available" do
      # before: set up stove top
      # ...
      # end
      expect(warm_up_by_stove_top).to be_truthy
    end
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p>As you can imagine, if these tests are filled up and more nested contexts are added, such as microwave settings depending on size of dishes, stove top heat amount and time, etc... they will eventually become too long and too complicated to read and follow. This readability problem is then compounded for other developers who haven't worked on this area of the robot. But there's another issue in moving from Ruby to Elixir; there is no way to write nested "contexts" like this in Elixir's ExUnit — and there is a good reason for that.</p><div data-inherit-lp-settings="1" data-css="tve-u-1778e041318" tcb-template-name="Quote 05" tcb-template-id="60950" data-keep-css_id="1"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e0414c4"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131b"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131d"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131e"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e04131f"><div data-css="tve-u-1778e041320"><div><p><span><img alt="" data-id="60893" width="99" data-init-width="175" height="77" data-init-height="137" title="quotation_mark_afs" loading="lazy" src="https://vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-src="//vendorful.com/wp-content/uploads/tcb_content_templates/images/quotation_mark_afs.png" data-width="99" data-height="77" ml-d="0" data-css="tve-u-1778e041322"></span></p></div></div></div></div><p data-css="tve-u-1778e04132a">By forbidding hierarchies in favor of named setups, it is straightforward for the developer to glance at each describe block and know exactly the setup steps involved.</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>With ExUnit, what you can (and will want to) do is to use named setups.</p><h3>What are named setups?</h3><p>If you haven't come across this, it's not surprising. The documentation for named setups in ExUnit is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/master/ExUnit.Case.html#describe/2" target="_blank">kind of buried</a> somewhere in the middle of ExUnit.Case docs. Named setups are simply configurations of tests used to put together test data for the tests that follow. Each setup is actually just a function that configures the test data and returns the variables to be used in the tests themselves. If you are familiar with writing tests in ExUnit then these configuration functions are exactly the setup blocks. For example:</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dishes(context) do
temp = 35
size = if context.size, do: size, else: :small
dish = set_temperature(temp)
|&gt; set_size(size)
|&gt; set_time_in_fridge(:15_hours)
|&gt; build_dish


%{temp: temp, size: size, cold_dish: dish}
end
</pre></div></div><p>Note that a <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57900e">context</span> variable is passed in this setup function so that the previous configurations can be accessed in this setup as <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57c597">context.size</span> in this case. You can also grab the <span data-css="tve-u-1778e57ea83">size</span> variable out of this <span data-css="tve-u-1778e580e83">context</span> right in the function signature like so:</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
defp setup_cold_dish(%{size: size}) do
end</pre></div></div><p><h3>How do I use it in the tests?</h3></p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes from left over" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish]
  it "", context do
    ...
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p>Let's make it even nicer by combining the condition "seasoning available":</p><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes from left over when seasoning available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_seasoning]
  it "", context do
    assert add_seasoning
  end
end
</pre></div></div><p><h3>Passing variables to other setup functions</h3></p><p>Note that if you have multiple setup functions in sequence like this, <strong>the latter ones on the right can read the "context" variables returned by the previous ones on the left</strong>. So <span data-css="tve-u-1778e46a275">:set_seasoning</span> can actually access <span data-css="tve-u-1778e4728d6">temp</span>, <span data-css="tve-u-1778e470109">size</span> and <span data-css="tve-u-1778e474efb">cold_dish</span> variables from <span data-css="tve-u-1778e478abc">:setup_cold_dish</span>, but we just not doing anything with them in this scenario.</p><div><h4>Putting the pieces together</h4><p>Now let's write the whole thing with combined conditions!</p></div><div><div><pre data-enlighter-language="ruby">elixir
describe "make COLD dishes when seasoning available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_seasoning]
  it "", context do
    assert add_seasoning
  end
end

describe "make COLD dishes when extra protein available" do
  setup [:setup_cold_dish, :set_protein]
  it "", context do
    assert add_protein
  end
end

describe "make HOT dishes when microwave available" do
  setup [:setup_hot_dish, :set_microwave]
  it "", context do
    assert use_microwave
  end
end

describe "make HOT dishes when stove top available" do
  setup [:setup_hot_dish, :set_stove_top]
  it "", context do
    assert use_stove_top
  end
end
</pre></div></div><div><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The tests are now flattened, much cleaner and easier for other developers (and, of course, for me at a later time) to read and follow at a glance. And the beauty of it is that there are no more nested context/describe blocks, no more mazes but with shared setup functions and cleaner code!</p><p>Although the above example scenario is &nbsp;very simple to demonstrate the basic functionalities of named setups, I hope you can build on these ideas and apply them to your test suite when you need it.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>&lt;rant&gt;Two years ago I sat in on a security meeting. The subject was protecting the code and associated websites from attack.</p><p>"I'd just attack the npm packaging system, introducing subtle changes in several that would work together to do whatever I wanted."</p><p>All I got was blank stares, and this was from professionals. From <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hacks-over-35-tech-firms-in-novel-supply-chain-attack">this week's reading</a>:</p><blockquote>Unlike <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-npm-project-steals-discord-accounts-browser-info/">traditional typosquatting attacks</a> that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages.<p>This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called <strong>dependency confusion.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even using things like Test-Driven Development, programmers can only reason about a small part of the code in front of him in the IDE. (In fact, one of the reasons TDD is so successful is because programmers have no idea at how much they suck at actually understanding what they're doing).</p><p>From a recent study:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/EsXlJyCXYAAD9x7.png 1890w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here's the takeaway graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2021-02-11_9-41-46.jpg 678w"></figure><p>Note: this result is seeking out a mean, regular coders writing regular code. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>Why is this? Let's take two code samples:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>echo Hello World
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello from %s!\n", "HelloWorld");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the first example, how many symbols is the programmer manipulating to reach their goal? Only one, "echo" In the second example, how many symbols are being manipulated?</p><p>I counted seven, but I wasn't trying to be strict.</p><p>What do these seven involve? There's namespaces, libraries, standard function signatures, string substitution, OS return values, and so on.</p><p>Do any of these matter to the new C# programmer? Of course not! That's why it's called "Hello World". You're supposed to be able to type in a few symbols and start doing something useful right away.</p><p>The waters get murky very quickly after that. Let's say your boss sends you an email:</p><p>"Jenkins, add the cover sheet to all of those TPS reports"</p><p>Something goes wrong. The boss is unhappy. You two have a conversation about what you did that was mistaken.</p><p>Suppose instead you're looking at the following code:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>WorkingStack.Reports.AddSheet(cover);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The boss is mad because it's not working right.</p><p>You can certainly go into the boss's office and have that same conversation, just this time over code instead of an email. <em>In fact, that's what you have to do</em>. Without a bunch more source code, what the hell does that C# code do, anyway? You don't know. It says it does the same thing as the boss wanted, but for all you know it's mailing off your tax returns to Russian hackers.</p><p>Most of modern programming is spent creating and consuming fake abstractions that are much more leaky and buggy than we'd like admit. In fact, it's grown far, far beyond our ability to reason about. It's magic. We spend a lot of time pretending that this isn't the case, then cursing when reality rears its ugly head again.</p><p>When I was writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">my second book</a>, I had to address this problem because reasoning about code and controlling complexity is the number one problem in software development today. It's the reason we have buildings full of hundreds of developers wasting a lot of time and money. Our incentives are wrong.</p><p>The best thing to look for in any professional, doctor, lawyer, coder, etc is their ability to not engage with a problem, instead solving it in a simple and non-intrusive way. The worst behavior from professionals are the folks who are going to do a lot of work no matter what. These guys look busy, and they’re deep in a bunch of technically wonky stuff that nobody understands, so naturally they look like they know what they’re doing and are doing a good job. The guy who shows up in flip-flops and after a five-minute conversation solves your problem? He’s just some smart eleck showman, probably a con man.</p><p>We don’t teach coders the one skill they need most of all: adding incremental complexity as-needed. Nobody talks about choosing what to add and why. Nobody talks about ways to understand you’ve gone too far (except for a few folks like me. Apologies for the shameless plug.)</p><p>For some odd reason, discussions on frameworks and complexity always devolve into some version of “Dang kids!” vs. “Talentless luddite!” As many people have pointed out, not only do we not teach or talk about incremental complexity, if you don’t have the appropriate buzzwords in your CV, you don’t get hired. So BigCorps naturally end up with scads of people who did well on scads of tech that somebody decide they had to use/learn but nobody very good at actually making things happen.</p><p>This can't continue, and I want to do my part in making it end. The answer I came up is something I call it <strong>Code Cognitive Load (CCL)</strong>. It's the amount of risk you take on as a programmer looking at any piece of code to manipulate it, whether coding fresh or doing maintenance on existing code.</p><ol><li>It's scoped first by method/function and then by compilation unit. There's no other scoping (namespace, class, module, etc.)</li><li>To compute, you add up four things: symbols you are required to look at to do your work, exceptions that using those symbols may throw, &nbsp;any editable code underneath that you may have to read or write for those symbols to work, and exceptions that code may throw</li></ol><p>You can see for the first Hello World example, there's only one symbol, echo, and there's only one general type of exception, and that's related to system resources. For the second example, the count easily goes into the dozens.</p><p>Why is this related to the security problem I led off with? Because if you have code you can't reason about, you don't just have a risk for bugs, it's a security risk too. The code doesn't care whether it's busy screwing up your beautiful solution or hacking your local network. You can't reason about it. Period. That's the problem. It's doing whatever it's coded to do.</p><p>Do npm packages count as "editable code underneath that I have to read or write for these symbols to work"? Sure, if you're downloading code and compiling it, you may have to edit it. It's a risk. If you're just hotlinking to a dll or something, that's different. If you're using precompiled code, whatever you've got, you've got. It may be buggy as hell and it may do nasty things that make you sad and drink by yourself late at night, but it's not a complexity issue, it's some other kind of issue, security, performance, and so on. Don't confuse them. You address and work with the problems of that precompiled library in a totally different way than you would with code you may one day have to plow through.</p><p>Code Cogntivie Load (CCL) is not a good/bad metric. It's a measure of the risk in complexity you're assuming to do whatever work you have to do. Some problems may naturally require a great deal of complexity risk. Others not so much. That's your call, not mine.</p><p>The point is that you're measuring it, instead of just ignoring it until something goes wrong. Is your solution doing mostly the same thing but your CCL is going through the roof? You're most likely doing something wrong, since your code's value is staying the same while your coding risk is dramatically increasing. </p><p>There's no way of knowing whether code is appropriately complex or not, but we can (and should) measure how much <em>complexity risk</em> we're taking on ourselves and our downstream maintenance workers.</p><p>This will change the way you code and the way you think about coding. Good. Looking at the software landscape today, things need changing.</p><p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>    </div>

                    <div><p>Operational analytics is a type of analytics that informs day-to-day decisions with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your organization’s operations. Now, that’s a fairly boring definition for an idea that I sincerely believe has the potential to change how organizations use data. </p><p>Instead of using dashboards or reports to understand your data, operational analytics drives action by automatically delivering real-time data to the exact place it’ll be most useful, no matter where that is in your organization. </p><p>And when implemented well, this flow of real-time data (from data warehouses to people who can actually do something with that data) becomes an undercurrent of insights powering important daily decisions, both big and small.</p><p>Here’s a quick thought experiment. What if you could do the following?: &nbsp;</p></div><ul><li>Prioritize support tickets by product usage</li><li>Use sales outreach data to segment audiences for marketing email drip campaigns</li><li>Plug early churn indicators right into your customer relationship management platform</li></ul><div><p>I could go on (and I just might, if you want to <a href="https://getcensus.com/demo">hop on a call</a>), but the point is that operational analytics can make all of what I just listed happen automatically behind the scenes. When it’s time to resolve a support ticket, create an email list, or give a customer a call, team members can jump right into action without having to mess with emails, dashboards, reports, or spreadsheets.</p><p>At its core, operational analytics is about putting an organization’s data to work so everyone can make smart decisions about your business. You might’ve heard such a promise before from other technologies or platforms, but operational analytics is the <em>only</em> way to accomplish this at scale, because it introduces a set of

alt="image.png"></figure><h2 id="traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Traditional analytics uses data to <em>understand </em>business operations, while operational analytics uses data to <em>drive </em>business operations. This difference may seem subtle at first glance, but it cuts deep into the role data plays within your company.</p><p>I’m defining traditional analytics here as the data presented viabusiness intelligence (BI) dashboards and static reports created at a regular cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly). Broadly speaking, the job of traditional analytics is to use data to provide an understanding of what’s going on in your business to inform strategic decisions over time.</p><p>The types of questions traditional analytics answers are along the lines of “Is this product line generating revenue?”</p><p>Operational analytics is a flow of data from your data warehouse into other tools, like <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/zendesk">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.getcensus.com/integrations/hubspot">Hubspot</a> or <a href="https://getcensus.com/integrations/intercom">Intercom</a>. The job of operational analytics is to inform specific activities inside your company, whether that's sales, marketing, support, or customer success. </p><p>The types of questions operational analytics answers are something like “Which support ticket should I tackle first?” </p><p>The difference is in what you use the data to achieve. Traditional analytics looks at data over time to inform long-term strategy; operational analytics looks at data in the moment to inform strategic action. </p></div><h3 id="a-specific-example-of-traditional-analytics-vs-operational-analytics">A Specific Example of Traditional Analytics vs. Operational Analytics</h3><div><p>Let’s take a customer success (CS) team at a growing startup as an example. This team would use traditional analytics to measure performance and plan ahead while using operational analytics to get stuff done.</p><p>A CS director might need a BI dashboard to track how long it would take to resolve support tickets on average. Ticket resolution time is a good metric for measuring past performance while providing a rough indication of future CS team workload. These insights can inform staffing decisions or changes in CS team processes, but they won’t help individual CS reps resolve more tickets in the next hour.</p><p>To resolve more tickets in the next hour, a CS rep might need help with support ticket prioritization. Operational analytics can pull customer information into each support ticket and automatically prioritize them based on a few key characteristics, like if the customer is part of a VIP program, if they’ve shown risk of churn, or if they might be open to an upsell. </p><p>For the CS rep, this might look like a few more fields plugged into each support ticket, while the list of tickets overall is automatically ranked by importance. As they settle in over their morning coffee, the CS rep doesn’t have to think through “Which ticket should I tackle first?” Operational analytics answers this question for them, so they can take action.</p><p>Over time, the performance of your CS team will improve, leading to higher retention, less churn, and more satisfied customers overall — all because each CS rep will know which support ticket to tackle first in order to have the most impact on your business’s bottom line.</p><p>If you empower every team in a similar way as this CS team example, you can start to see the overall impact operational analytics can have. It makes every decision made by each individual a strategic choice that’s backed by real-time data.</p></div><h2 id="how-operational-analytics-works">How Operational Analytics Works</h2><div><p>There is a kind of new standard data stack that has emerged in the last few years, centered on a data warehouse that can support both traditional and operational analytics. If you invest in this core infrastructure, implementing operational analytics becomes fairly attainable for businesses of just about any size.</p><p>The modern data stack is made up of four sections: data integration, data storage, data modeling, and data activation. </p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png" alt="Modern Data Stack" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/modern_data_stack_hub_spoke.png 1941w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>A simple data stack might have the following tools filling out each of these four sections:</p><ul><li>Data Integration: <a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, an ETL (extract, load, transform) tool, will integrate all your data sources into your data warehouse.</li><li>Data Storage: <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/p/839c412a-1b36-4859-ad58-a70059cf47a5/snowflake.com">Snowflake</a>, a data warehouse, can store structured and unstructured data all in one place.</li><li>Data Modeling: <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/p/839c412a-1b36-4859-ad58-a70059cf47a5/getdbt.com">dbt</a>, a data modeling tool, helps you manage your data with a library of data models, which will make your data usable for different purposes.</li><li>Data Activation: <a href="https://getcensus.com/">Census</a> (that’s us!), a data automation tool, will pull your usable data out of your data warehouse, validate it automatically, and send it to the tools that need it (like our CS rep’s CRM).</li></ul><div><p>A conceptual way to think of this data stack is as a <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/hub-and-spoke-vs-point-to-point-data-synchronization-theres-one-clear-winner/">hub and spoke</a>, where Snowflake serves as a “hub” for all data. From this hub extends “spokes,” which are places that data comes from and places that data goes to (e.g., CRMs, marketing automation platforms, a/b testing software). </p><p>It’s the job of Fivetran to move data from the spokes into Snowflake. Once the data is in Snowflake, dbt helps make all that data ready for use. Then, Census moves the prepared data from Snowflake to the spokes it needs to go to. </p><p>Traditional analytics sends data out of your data warehouse for very specific tools, like a BI platform. Operational analytics sends data out of your data warehouse to just about whichever spoke needs it. They’re essentially different types of spokes that extend out of a single source of truth: your data warehouse.</p><p>None of the tools listed here will break the bank (although <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/snowflake-vs-redshift-just-choose-snowflake/">Snowflake can get expensive</a> if you’re not careful). And they’re easy to set up —<a href="https://www.hashpath.com/2020/11/build-a-modern-data-analytics-stack-from-scratch-in-under-an-hour/"> Seth Rosen proved it can be done in around 40 minutes</a> — and modular, so if you need to swap them out for another tool you can. The point is that this data stack’s barrier for entry is fairly low.</p></div><h2 id="why-you-should-use-operational-analytics">Why You Should Use Operational Analytics</h2><div><p>Any company with more than a handful of customers will likely need operational analytics. Once you reach a point of having a few customers’ data flowing into your data warehouse, you’ll quickly find the limitations of the individual tools you’re currently using. Operational analytics not only provides a way to overcome these limitations at scale but also allows your data team to step up and take a more proactive role in how your business uses data.</p><p>Without operational analytics, you have to rely on the analytics capabilities of your individual tools (aka spokes, as we outlined above). There are two types of limitations this places on your team’s capabilities:</p></div><ol><li><strong>You’re limited by the data you have in that system. </strong>If you’re running a complex email drip campaign in Marketo, you need to segment your audiences using Marketo.</li><li><strong>You have to connect the dots on your own. </strong>Say you need to call a customer to prevent churn because they haven’t used your product in a while. First, you need to identify that they’re not using your product in your product analytics tool, and then you need to convey that message to your CS team so they can make the call.</li></ol><div><p>Companies will often use spreadsheets as a work-around. Which can work well, up to a point. But once you start dealing with any sort of scale (think 5-10 customers), the data quickly outgrows the capabilities of a Google Sheets doc and some filtering.</p><p>Even worse, you’re relying on overworked operations people to manage how those tools work together. There’s a marketing operations person wrestling with Marketo day in and day out, managing these audiences and lists manually. There are CS reps swapping between dashboards, email, the help desk, and spreadsheets, trying to prioritize what to do next.</p><p>With operational analytics, you can automate all of these daily brain-draining tasks so these employees can actually start doing their work. </p><p>Marketo can now include ad campaign and sales outreach data to help your marketing ops person create hyperspecific drip campaigns, all within Marketo. The CS team can know, without any extra work on their part, which customers are at risk of churn by importing product-usage data — all without wading through miles of spreadsheets or relying on traditional analytics that are just not suited for these types of use cases. The data is just there.</p><p>The “X factor” making all of this possible …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Detecting people’s names is part and parcel of PII discovery. Traditional techniques like regexps and keywords don’t work, because the set of all names is too varied. How do open source Named Entity Recognition (NER) engines compare, and can we do better?</p><p>
<em>This Part 1 has NER results and benchmarks. There’s also <a href="https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text-part-2-technical/">Part 2 with technical neural network details</a>.<br>
</em></p><h2 id="sota_ner">Developing a state-of-the-art named entity recognizer</h2><p>
A good named entity recognizer (NER) is essential for detecting names, home addresses, <a href="https://twitter.com/PII_tools/status/1230905790745260032">passport scans</a> etc, for purposes of compliance or <a href="https://pii-tools.com/pii-exclusions-data-breach/">breach incident management</a>.</p><p>
One could use a prepared list of names and surnames for this task, but such gazetteer obviously cannot be exhaustive and will fail on sentences like this:</p><blockquote><p>“<b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.”</p></blockquote><p>Humans recognize easily what is a person’s name and what isn’t. For machines, the task is more difficult because they have trouble understanding context. This leads to the famous two types of errors:</p><ul><li><strong>False positives</strong>: words detected as personal names that are not, typically because they’re capitalized (<code>"Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands."</code>); as well as</li><li><strong>False negatives</strong>: names missed by the detection, typically because they’re lowercased, foreign or uncommon. Example: <code>"bill carpenter was playing football."</code></li></ul><p>
So in order to recognize person names in text it is necessary to know not only what names look like, but also in what context they’re used and have a general domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="motivation">Why not just use open source?</h2><p>
NER is a well-studied task in academia. Naturally, we turned to open source NER solutions first. We evaluated the most popular ready-made software: Stanford NER and Stanza from the Stanford University, FLAIR from Zalando Research, spaCy from Explosion AI.</p><p>
To cut the story short, <strong>none of these open source tools were precise and fast enough</strong> for our purposes. While they work great on well-behaved data such as news articles or Wikipedia, their academic pedigree implodes when applied to the wild, messy documents of the real world.</p><p>
For this reason we developed our own NER, with special focus on <strong>names as they appear in real company documents</strong>. The resulting NER is proprietary (part of <a href="https://pii-tools.com/">PII Tools</a>) but we decided to share some technical design tips and results here, in the hope they help others.</p><p>
In this article, we’ll compare our creation against popular open source options. Additionally, we’ll benchmark a simple gazetteer-based NER that uses a predefined list of names, to serve as a <strong>baseline</strong>.</p><table><caption>Description of tested NERs</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>version</th><th>type</th><th>language</th><th>source</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>–</td><td><abbr title="contains 5.6M unique names">list of names</abbr></td><td>multi-language</td><td>inhouse</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>4.1</td><td>CRF classifier</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html</a></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>1.1.1</td><td>neural network</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/">https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="ner-multi-fast model">flair</abbr></th><td>0.6.1</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair">https://github.com/flairNLP/flair</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="xx_ent_wiki_sm model">spacy</abbr></th><td>2.3.2</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a></td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>3.8.0</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://pii-tools.com/">https://pii-tools.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Our requirements for the new NER were:</p><ul><li><strong>multi-language</strong>, with special focus on English, Spanish, German and Portuguese/Brazilian;</li><li>to accept <strong>arbitrary document contexts</strong>: text coming from PDFs, Word documents, Excel, email, database field, OCR…;</li><li><strong>efficient</strong>, to process <strong>large amounts of text quickly on a CPU</strong> (no need for specialized GPU hardware) and with a <strong>low memory footprint</strong>,</li><li><strong>flexible</strong> to be able to evolve the model behaviour: retraining, adding new languages, correcting detection errors;</li><li>and of course to be <strong>accurate</strong>, to minimize false positives and negatives.</li></ul><p>
To compare our NER we evaluated performance on standard benchmark datasets, <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/">CoNLL-2002</a> (for Spanish), <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/">CoNLL-2003</a> (English, German) and <a href="https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/">LeNER-Br</a> (Portuguese).</p><p>We also included a manually annotated <code>openweb</code> dataset, to make sure we test on data that no NER system (including ours!) has seen during training. Text for this dataset was randomly sampled from the English <a href="https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/">OpenWebTextCorpus</a>. We value results on <code>openweb</code> the most, because OpenWeb reflects the real (messy) data found in real documents the closest, among these public datasets.</p><h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2><p>
We measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F1 scores</a> for person names detected by each software. F1 scores range from 0 to 100, the higher the better. A “hit” (true positive) means the entire name was matched exactly, beginning to end. This is the strictest metric; we specifically <emph>don’t</emph> calculate success over the number of correctly predicted tokens, or even individual characters.</p><table><caption>Performance benchmark [F1 score – higher is better]</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>German</th><th>Portuguese</th><th>openweb</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>59.1</td><td>62.3</td><td>54.9</td><td>45.2</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>94.9</td><td>91.1</td><td>93.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>82.2</td><td>98.4</td><td>87.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>86.7</td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>95.8</td><td>96.9</td><td>91.3</td><td>62.9</td><td>90.6</td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>86.1</td><td>87.0</td><td>74.1</td><td>42.0</td><td>81.3</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>92.3</td><td>90.6</td><td>89.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>95.7</td></tr></tbody></table><div id="attachment_4542"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4542" loading="lazy" src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" alt="F1 scores for NER software that detect personal names." width="1015" height="482" srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" data-srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" data-src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p id="caption-attachment-4542">F1 scores of NER software that detect person names.</p></div><p>
In all tests our NER is among the top contenders – but keep in mind that accuracy was just one of our 5 design goals. For example, we “lost” a few F1 points on purpose by switching from Tensorflow to TF lite, trading accuracy for a much smaller &amp; faster model.</p><p>
For the Portuguese language (Brazil, LGPD) and <code>openweb</code> dataset, PII Tools is the clear winner. As mentioned above <code>openweb</code> reflects “real data” the closest, so this is great.</p><p>
Let’s look at some concrete examples:</p><table><caption>Text samples and NER detections (actual expected names are <strong>in bold</strong>)</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>stanford</th><th>stanza</th><th>flair</th><th>spacy</th><th>pii-tools</th></tr><tr><td><b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nawab Zulfikar Ali Magsi</b> did not see <b>Shama Parveen Magsi</b> coming.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>bill carpenter</b> was playing football.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><abbr title="a village in Wales">Llanfihangel Talyllyn</abbr> is beautiful.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
These samples are rather edge cases, but serve to get an idea of what detectors have to deal with, and how successful they are.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>
Now we will look into other aspects of our requirements. Detection performance was measured on CPU, our <code>pii-tools</code> NER was artificially restricted to a single process with a single thread, others were left in default settings.</p><table><caption>Speed and memory comparison</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><abbr title="short documents of ~500 bytes">speed short [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="long documents of ~2.5 kB">speed long [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="time to initializate NER + tag a 20 character text">startup time [s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="peak RAM while tagging 270 kB of text">RAM usage [MB]</abbr></th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>350.0</td><td>1100.0</td><td>1.1</td><td>1420</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>30.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>1.5</td><td><abbr title="for one language only">248</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>0.4</td><td>1.2</td><td>6.1</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">1073</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>5.2</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">5341</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>70.0</td><td>200.0</td><td>0.5</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>35.0</td><td>230.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>387</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Overall FLAIR and Stanza are definitely out, due to their super slow speed and high RAM usage. A worthy competitor from the performance perspective is spaCy, whose authors put a great deal of effort into optimization. Unfortunately spaCy’s tokenization quirks and opinionated architecture proved too inflexible for our needs.</p><p>
Likewise, Stanford NER is the most accurate among the open source alternatives, but is quite rigid – it’s really hard to update its models or add a new language. Plus its GNU GPL license won’t be to everyone’s liking.</p><h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2><p>
Our focus on industry use calls for frequent model modifications: adding new languages, new kinds of documents (document contexts in which names may appear), fixing detection errors.</p><p>
In order to adapt the PII Tools NER model quickly, we built a pipeline that utilizes several “weaker” NERs and automatic translation tools to build a huge training corpus from varied sources. This focus on real-world data, along with a robust automated Tensorflow training pipeline allows adding new languages and controlling NER outputs more easily than the open source solutions.</p><p>
While developing our <code>pii-tools</code> NER we implemented most components from scratch, including:</p><ul><li>a large scale annotated dataset (proprietary data)</li><li>a tokenizer (critical; none of the open source variants do this part well)</li><li>token features (input to the neural network)</li><li>convolutional neural network (NN architecture)</li><li>data augmentation and training pipeline (for grounded model updates)</li><li>various tricks to push performance or to squeeze a lot of information into a smaller parameter space</li></ul><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I want to outline the tools I use to consume textual content, and why it <em>perfectly</em> fits my needs.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe this can be helpful for you too.</p>

<p>(This should have been a pun on “HTTPS everywhere”…)</p>
<p>Been an avid RSS consumer for the past years.</p>
<p>But I’ve always encountered the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost RSS feeds while distro-hopping (either forgot or lost backups of the config files)</li>
<li>didn’t like the RSS reader’s UI</li>
<li>needed to install an extra native application for reading my news (both on my PC and phone)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Yes, I know you could use Feedly, Reedr and others, but it didn’t suit my needs)</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-web"><a href="#embrace-the-web">#</a> Embrace the Web</h3>
<p>I am a web-guy (whatever that means).</p>
<p>I almost exclusively use the Web, be it for apps one would have a native app for or browsing in general.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve found my perfect stack for keeping up to date with the latest news:</p>
<p>RSS for</p>
<ul>
<li>blogs (obviously)</li>
<li>HackerNews frontpage (yes, there is an RSS for it)</li>
<li>Twitter (although I added only a few feeds, via Nitter RSS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hackernews-frontpage"><a href="#hackernews-frontpage">#</a> HackerNews frontpage</h3>
<p>I found myself checking the HN frontpage <strong>way</strong> too often, only to make a visual diff in my brain to skim through the articles I already read.</p>
<p>This changed finally once I discovered HN-RSS:</p>
<p>E.g. I get all posts that make it to the HackerNews frontpage via this RSS feed</p>
<pre><code>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</code></pre>
<h3 id="tweets"><a href="#tweets">#</a> Tweets</h3>
<p>And the tweets from a handful of Twitter users through Nitter’s RSS feeds:</p>
<pre><code>https://nitter.eu/&lt;TWITTER_HANDLE&gt;/rss
</code></pre>
<p>You can host your own instance if you prefer, or choose one from any other <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">public one’s</a></p>
<h2 id="miniflux-to-the-rescue"><a href="#miniflux-to-the-rescue">#</a> Miniflux to the rescue</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The awesome part of <a href="https://miniflux.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">miniflux</a> is that I can</p>
<ul>
<li>self-host it (a baby could run it via docker and set up a reverse-proxy with nginx)</li>
<li>Integrate Pocket (<a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">getpocket.com</a>) for bookmarking articles or reading them later on</li>
<li>Read the whole article without leaving Miniflux</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last point is because Miniflux will fetch the original article automatically if the RSS entry only contains a summary)</p>
<p>You want other reasons?</p>
<p>Privacy, simplicity, clean and no-frills UI, FOSS</p>
<p>This is how the UI looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-example.png" alt="miniflux example"></p>
<p>By clicking on the article I can read it in full.</p>
<p>I use the <code>Save</code> button to offload the articles to Pocket, and read them later.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarklet"><a href="#bookmarklet">#</a> Bookmarklet</h3>
<p>Through a simple bookmark in my browser (both on PC and phone), I can simply subscribe to any website or blog that has an RSS feed.</p>
<p>This makes it super easy to subscribe to someone’s RSS feed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article data-theme="classic" id="article"><header><h2>Or, "Any excuse to talk about folk music"</h2><h3>by <a href="https://senryu.pub/users/robotmay">Robert May</a> on <a href="https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles">Afternoon Robot</a></h3></header><section><h2>Background</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had quite bad RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) caused by working entirely on a small laptop for 6 months. It was a mistake for many reasons, but the major one was that I had inadvertantly changed my typing style to work with it. I was resting my wrists on the laptop case, I was using the touchpad, and I had it quite close to my body because it was small. I had to make a fairly dramatic change to halt the onset of the RSI, but at the time I didn't understand what I had done to cause it - after all, I've been typing a lot, at a reasonable speed, since I was ~10 years old.</p>

<p>It took 20 years, but finally I had suffered the consequences of my constant computer use.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>Immediately I set out to spend money. The first change I made was to buy an "ergonomic" keyboard, and I went for an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>, which is a nice bit of kit. I also bought a wireless trackball; a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html">Logitech MX Ergo</a>. I'm now on my second of these and I really like it.</p>

<p>At the same time I started trying to learn the <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman</a> layout, which I think is largely rather smart, and which focuses on home-row typing. I initially tried Colemak but that seems oddly flawed in applying too much frequency to keys under the little fingers.</p>

<p>After some time, rather wonderfully, my RSI was substantially improved.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually for the reasons I originally thought. In fact, the RSI started disappearing because I essentially took a 3 month break from typing a lot, due to the high learning curve of swapping to a split board and new layout at the same time. Once I was back up to speed, the RSI started coming back.</p>

<h2>Why does it still hurt?</h2>

<p>Had I broken my body irreparably? No, as it turns out. In fact, all I had to do was just go back to everything I was doing before the laptop incident, and give myself time.</p>

<h3>As in all things, folk music is the cure</h3>

<p>Discovering the real cause of the problem came about by comparing typing on a computer to my musical instruments. I never get RSI on my diatonic accordions, or on the piano. Why are they different? Surely they use the same muscles, more or less. In fact their key weight is notably heavier. Even more weirdly, my RSI was non-existent when I played on them, even when it was at its worst on the computer.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to play the diatonic accordion but I tend to use a single strap and use the weight of the instrument to allow me to shift my hands whilst still holding it relatively still; I prefer this to strapping it tightly to my body and having entirely free hands. Here's an example video from a few years back:</p>



<p>There are better tunes and examples I could make but that would involve filming something new and I had this lying about. This video is a fairly good example in that I regularly slide my hand quickly downwards instead of stretching. It's more tempting to stretch when first learning the instrument as you don't want to lose your reference point, but learning to shift up and down the keys makes more difficult passages playable and actually quite comfortable. It's generally more comfortable to keep your fingers straight-ish and shift your hand up and down in that position. I now do this even more than in this video and regularly play tunes that use the full length of the keyboard. In fact, they're often my favourite ones to play! I now usually play with my thumb behind the keyboard, which I find makes it very easy to slide up and down. Here's another, rougher, old example, sure to give you motion sickness, from when I was selling an unwanted instrument:</p>



<p>Yes, accordions are a very quick way to ruin a motion-stabilisation algorithm-writer's day.</p>

<p>The hands aren't as free-floating as on a piano, as you have to hold the instrument at the same time. The key weight is actually fairly comparable to a computer keyboard, though at the heavier end. The piano is different, in that the key weight is actually pretty immense, particularly at the lower-end on a grand piano keyboard, and therefore requires a somewhat different method of striking the keys to a computer keyboard - the strength doesn't come from moving your finger up and down (but I won't go into that here as there are a million piano ergonomics articles).</p>

<h3>Problems with ergonomic or split keyboards</h3>

<p>The primary goal of many ergonomic keyboard enthusiasts is to reduce movement entirely and to move everything onto modifier layers. The Ergodox is known to be flawed in this regard as the thumb cluster is a bit of a stretch for most people, as well as the larger keys around the outside being a bit of an odd stretch. It's almost like it has two competing designs: one to reduce movement entirely, and the other to require movement in order to hit these extra buttons.</p>

<p>But the major flaw for me is that it ensures you can only ever use each hand on one half of the keyboard, and this means that keys which could often be a shared workload, such as <code>T,Y,G,H,B</code> are now dedicated to a hand. This is also a flaw I see with the "ortho-linear" layouts which remove key staggering. The argument for these optimisations is to remove stretching, which I agree with, but they do it by reducing movement, which I don't.</p>

<p>Instead of forcibly splitting the workload, I share it even more between my hands. But not by stretching! Instead my hands move freely over the keyboard, picking up letters or symbols in awkward places without having to perform difficult stretches with my fingers.</p>

<h3>The problem with home-row typing</h3>

<p>In my personal experience I found home-row typing to actually be unergonomic mostly because of the additional bend required from moving both hands closer together. This produces more strain on your wrist in order for your hand to be straighter on the keyboard. This is one aspect the split-keyboard design does solve, but it's also solvable on a normal keyboard.</p>

<p>It can be alleviated somewhat by moving the keyboard further away from you, allowing your wrists to be straighter. This however often means applying more pressure to the under-side of the wrist or arm as holding the weight of your hands further from your body is more tiring.</p>

<p>Instead I looked back at how I used to type, and realised that although my left hand sat more-or-less in the home-row position, i.e. with the index finger on <code>F</code>, my right hand sat further to the right, with the index finger somewhere between <code>K</code> and <code>L</code>. This is a wider "stance" and results in straighter wrists, as well as less stretching required for the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Right Shift</code> keys.</p>

<h2>This is the Way</h2>

<p>Looking at both instruments and reflecting on how I had typed before <em>The Laptop, First-born of Satan</em>, I settled on some ideas that are completely contrary to the accepted ergonomics of typing:</p>

<ol>
<li>The wrists themselves should not be under strain or pressure, including wrist-rests</li>
<li>The hands should move freely over the keyboard</li>
<li>The idea of "less movement" is incorrect, and instead I should aim for "less stretching"</li>
</ol>

<p>So I eBay'd the Ergodox, and used the money to buy a RealForce Topre keyboard. Weirdly, I bought a Japanese layout keyboard, which has some very slight advantages specific to my work that I'll explain shortly. I also ditched the Workman layout - it's nice, and I would recommend it, but most likely for those writing more prose than those programming. It flows well for words and becomes more awkward when using, say, <code>vim</code>, but it was particularly awkward in combination with the flaws of the Ergodox. Ultimately I dropped it because I realised my issues weren't down to QWERTY.</p>

<p>One aspect of the Ergodox which is nice is the ability to cant the keyboard over or away from you - I recommend doing this. If you raise a keyboard up, say with the feet usually attached at the back, you apply extra strain to the back of your hands to accommodate for the extra angle. Having a flatter keyboard is better in this regard.</p>

<h3>So this weird choice to use a Japanese layout keyboard huh?</h3>

<p><img title="RealForce Topre R2" alt="RealForce Topre R2" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/1ed11afe34645b232188eab4a32ce7d7.jpg"></p>

<p>So I bought a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TL-JPV-IV/">Japanese layout RealForce Topre R2 keyboard</a> with variably weighted springs. I love it, it's by far the best keyboard I've ever used. It was also hideously expensive, so if anyone from RealForce is out there and wants to supply me with keyboards to shill I am 100% <em>on-board</em>.</p>

<p>The Japanese layout both is and isn't odd. The extra keys for kana writing can be ignored, I just rebind them in <code>.Xmodmap</code> and use them for things like push-to-talk on Discord. The rest of the layout isn't too far from the UK ISO layout. Where it gets interesting is in the symbols.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-quotes are above <code>2</code>, which I like as it splits them between the hands. I typically use <code>Right Shift</code>+<code>2</code> to type it</li>
<li>Single-quotes are above <code>7</code>, which is hella weird at first, but actually I now really like it. I use it 50/50 with left or right shift, always using both hands</li>
<li>Both semi-colon and colon are first-level keys. This is awesome for programming</li>
<li><code>@</code> is a first-level key. This is particularly nice for <em>Ruby</em></li>
<li>Underscore is a bit weird, and sits directly next to a shortened shift. This was the hardest key to get used to. I tend to move my right hand over and use two fingers to press the combination</li>
<li>Everything else is slightly shifted from the UK ISO layout but not weirdly so</li>
</ol>

<p>Because I like it so much now, I also have a Bluetooth Japanese-layout HHKB for a travel keyboard, which is very nice. I just stick it on top of any laptop I might have to use, to show who's in charge.</p>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>



<p>This was surprisingly easier to film than I expected. You'll have to forgive me the dusty desk, I currently don't have a carpet in my office so it's almost entirely pointless dusting as it's back to this state within 2 days.</p>

<p>I've noticed my left hand moves less than my right, but you can see that it often covers over to <code>Y</code> and I also move frequently to <code>7</code> for the single-quote on this keyboard. I rarely use my pinky fingers on either hand for letters. The right hand moves very freely across <code>Enter</code>, modifiers, punctuation, and …</p></section></article></section></div></div>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2021/should-random-be-banned/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2021/should-random-be-banned/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Thought experiment: should the use of non-cryptographically secure <code>random()</code> be flagged to developers (examples: <a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec/blob/a4746e18e3df52bfb21f59420d2c57cb12ef40ec/rules/rand.go#L44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gosec</a>)? Assume we find the function calls 100% accurately (all true positives, no false positives), and we prevent merging when it’s present.</p>
<p>Academics would say yes — the <code>random()</code> rule always detects what it promises and could be a vulnerability. But the practitioners amongst us are likely to hesitate — does it matter enough to stop engineers’ work? Isn’t <code>random()</code> often used for non-cryptographically sensitive operations?</p>
<p>Herein lies the disconnect between static analysis theory and practice: the world’s most accurate static analysis rule is valueless if developers don’t agree the result has impact, yet as an industry we use the rate of true vs. false positives as the measure of quality.</p>
<p>At r2c we wanted to know how static analysis rules for Semgrep perform in practice. So we set out to create a better metric for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-findings/#analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep App</a> users. We call it Fix Rate.</p>
<p>Fix Rate is the percentage of merge-blocking findings that are fixed (i.e., not muted*) in CI. We believe this is a proxy for engineering value. As we run our own developer-focused security programs, we’re obsessing over how to increase the Fix Rate for the rules on our projects.</p>

<p>Observing a bad 0% Fix Rate for <code>random()</code> (with only 7 data points from our projects), we decided to silence the rule for r2c developers but send a Slack notification to the security team using <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-policy projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/#audit-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI audit mode</a>. Even in this first version, we’re finding Fix Rate incredibly powerful for evolving our own rules, policies, and development practices.</p>
<p>We shared Fix Rate with the Figma security team early on, which they used for rule development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With its GitHub integration, Semgrep brings security analysis to where development happens. Figmates get security feedback in their PRs, while rule analytics gives the security team feedback on the effectiveness of our rules and patterns. The simple grep like syntax allows us to extend Semgrep to catch new patterns, going from idea to live in an hour.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Dev Akhawe, Head of Security, Figma</em></p>
<p>We’re excited for developer action to determine the efficacy of static analysis rules. For this you need to surface real findings to real engineers writing real code; no pre-existing benchmark will suffice.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://ciphrd.com/2021/02/10/iframe-feedback-a-fun-technique-with-iframes-on-the-web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ciphrd.com/2021/02/10/iframe-feedback-a-fun-technique-with-iframes-on-the-web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>What would happen if a &lt;iframe&gt; tag on a page pointed to the same page ? In HTML, iframes are elements designed to display documents under an URL, as if we would load it as we normally do in our browsers. See it as a small window within a web document which can display another web document. For instance, what you see here is an &lt;iframe&gt; pointing to the homepage of this website, <strong>https://ciphrd.com</strong>:</p>







<p><em>On a side note, the technique I am going to present is not really “feedback” per say, it’s more like a regular loop, but it reminds so much of a feedback effect that I found the name appropriate.</em> <strong>Source code at the end.</strong></p>



<h4>1. The most basic &lt;iframe&gt; loop</h4>



<p>Just as a quick reminder, this is how an iframe can be used:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://ciphrd.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>



<p>The browser, when coming accros this tag, reads the <em>src</em> attribute and loads the web document under the URL into the area available for the iframe. Such area can be defined with <strong>CSS</strong> rules, or by setting a width and height attribute to the tag. For more informations, see the article about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">html iframe on W3Schools</a> [1].</p>



<p>Now, the idea behind &lt;iframe&gt; feedback: let the src attribute point to the same location as the page in which the &lt;iframe&gt; is displayed. To experiment with such idea, I built a very simple html page and I hosted it on a local server at <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong></p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;iframe loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;iframe&nbsp;src="http://localhost:8080"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>By loading http://localhost:8080/ in the browser, the document should be displayed and the &lt;iframe&gt; should display the same document, over and over. With some very simple rules we can define the size of our iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;500px;
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;320px;
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;20px;
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see how it is handled by chrome (88.0.4324.150):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="350" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>1. Our most basic example</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, that’s weird. It looks like the browser only loads the first &lt;iframe&gt; and then prevents an infinite loop from happening by removing the contents of the 2nd nested &lt;iframe&gt;. A quick inspection of the HTML tree will confirm our hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="734" height="459" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg 734w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px"><figcaption>2. Inspecting the HTML tree computed by Chrome</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, the hypothesis is verified. We cannot nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; tags because the browser prevents it, which is normal if we think about it. We wouldn’t want our computer to freeze if we were to load a webpage using such a trick.</p>



<h4>2. How to nest any number of &lt;iframe&gt;</h4>



<p>The issue here, is that the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is already present on the document loaded by the browser. Let’s see what happens if we insert the tag after the page has loaded, using javascript. Let’s reduce our HTML page to the following:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>And let’s write some Javascript which will insert the tag as soon as the page is loaded:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
document.body.append(iframe)</code></pre>



<p>The following javascript code needs to be loaded in the page somehow, the &lt;script&gt; tag can be used in that matter. However, because I am using <strong>webpack</strong>, my javascript gets automatically added to the document. The project I created for you to experiment with iframe feedback has the same feature, I’ll explain in <strong>on the last part of this article</strong>. For now, just assume that the javascript is added to the page. Let’s see what happens now:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>3. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag programatically</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same issue remains. Maybe we can try with a delay ?</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;this&nbsp;code&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;executed&nbsp;1000ms&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;has&nbsp;loaded</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>4. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag after a delay of 1sec</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, so it looks like we cannot just nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; this way. Maybe we need to trick the browser into thinking that the page displayed is not the same. To do that, I configured my local server so that any path provided after the URL will point to the index.html. So, if I try to load <strong>http://localhost:8080/home</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/cucumber</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/zeagjaga/ergjergeg/erg</strong>,… , the same index.html file will be loaded. We can now configure our script to set the <strong>src</strong> tag to the same domain plus a random string of characters:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;adds&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;string&nbsp;of&nbsp;7&nbsp;characters&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;domain</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="558" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-768x465.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>5. Iframes with a different URL pointing to the same page</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hehehe</strong>… It’s working. A quick inspection of the DOM can confirm this hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="687" height="533" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg 687w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px"><figcaption>6. The DOM of our infinite nested iframes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wonderful ! So, to nest “<em>self-replicating</em>” &lt;iframe&gt; tags, the constraints are the following:</p>



<ul><li>the URL path must be different</li><li>a server must be configured so that different URL points to the same document</li></ul>



<p>That’s it. We don’t even need the delay before inserting the &lt;iframe&gt;. I will keep it though, I don’t really want the browser to crash because of that (not that it will, but if we want to do more fun stuff than just adding a new &lt;iframe&gt;, it might).</p>



<h4>3. Having fun</h4>



<p>Now that we found a way to load as many nested &lt;iframe&gt; as we want, let’s have some fun ! First, let’s change the size of an &lt;iframe&gt; so that its dimensions are relative to the viewport area it renders to:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the&nbsp;title&nbsp;"float"&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;top&nbsp;left</em>
}</code></pre>



<p>Which will give us a way better result in terms of space occupation of the iframe elements:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="559" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-768x466.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>7. &lt;iframe&gt; dimensions are related to their parent dimensions</figcaption></figure>



<p>I guess you understand now why I called this technique <em>iframe feedback</em>. It just looks like it. However, <strong>this is by no mean true feedback</strong>.</p>



<p>We can remove the title and assign a random color to the background of the body to create a simple color effect:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;color&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;background,&nbsp;&nbsp;x|0&nbsp;removes&nbsp;the&nbsp;decimal&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;x</em>
document.body.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;`rgba(${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;1)`

setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;200)</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-simple-colors.mp4"></video><figcaption>8. Setting a random color to the body of the document</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are familiar with writing web applications, you may see now how much fun we can have with this technique. Let’s try adding some <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank">CSS animations</a></strong> [2] to the position of the &lt;iframe&gt;:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">body&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow:&nbsp;hidden;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;hides&nbsp;the&nbsp;scrollbar&nbsp;if&nbsp;window&nbsp;gets&nbsp;too&nbsp;small</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;100vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;size&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;viewport</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100vh;
}

<em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;

<p>I’m not going into in-depth details about what this CSS animation does. But here is the result:</p>

<p>We can add some rotation to the animation:</p>



<pre><code lang="css"><em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;

&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-adding-rotation.mp4"></video><figcaption>10. Adding rotation to the CSS animation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty fun ! What’s great is that we can take fulfill of all the sweet features made available by our browsers to have fun with this technique. Some issues remain though:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;iframe&gt; tags are added indefinitely</li><li>each &lt;iframe&gt; is independent, we have no way to know its position in the tree</li></ul>



<p>Let’s solve those issues and create a basic starting point from which <strong>experimentation with this technique can safely be done </strong>!</p>



<h4>4. Improving the solution</h4>



<p>First of all, we can define an easy solution to prevent iframes from being inserted indefinitely. If the viewport size reaches 0, there is no need to insert an iframe because it won’t have any effect on the screen:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>try</em>&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;(window.innerWidth&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;window.innerHeight&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>throw</em>&nbsp;new&nbsp;Error()&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;as&nbsp;usual</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;...</em>
}
<em>catch</em>&nbsp;(error)&nbsp;{}&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em></code></pre>



<p>The trick I am using here provides a way to <em>exit</em> the main script by using the try… catch mechanism. If we throw an error in the <strong>try</strong>{} block, what’s after will be skipped and the <strong>catch</strong>{} block will be triggered. If there were no catch block, the script would still stop but the error would be sent to the <strong>console as “Uncaught Error”</strong>. Yes, that’s what it is.</p>



<p>We now have a safe guard to prevent infinite looping in most cases. What we could need is to find a way to get the index of the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; <strong>nested nightmare</strong>. Remember, we currently use the following trick to call for a new iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')</code></pre>



<p>The <strong>location </strong>object [3] has different properties we can use to solve our problem. Let’s see what the <strong>location object</strong> is on the page <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em> :</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="565" height="286" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg 565w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"><figcaption>11. The Location object on <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It seems like the <strong>origin </strong>property stores whats before the first <strong>/</strong> and the <strong>pathname</strong> stores what’s after the origin (https://ciphrd.com), including the first <strong>/</strong>. Let’s use those properties to keep track of the index of each frame:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;gets&nbsp;what's&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;/&nbsp;,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;url&nbsp;path</em>
<em>//&nbsp;or&nbsp;0&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;path&nbsp;is&nbsp;empty&nbsp;(so&nbsp;t…</em></code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="document"><div><div><div><article><p><em>tl;dr—Despite an exponential increase in computing power, our applications
require more machines than ever because of architectural decisions made 25 years
ago. You can eliminate much of your complexity and cost by using SQLite &amp;
Litestream for your production applications.</em></p><h2 id="when-i-was-your-age">When I was your age…</h2><p>I can tell I’m getting old because I talk about the “good old days” of computing.
Back when knowing a single programming language and SQL was good enough to work
at most jobs. Back when you could build all your web pages with basic HTML skills.</p><p>But the good old days weren’t actually that good.</p><p>They kinda sucked.</p><p>In 1995, the <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/10/01/lamp-stack-php-mysql-apache-history/">LAMP stack</a> emerged. It was a combination of Linux, Apache,
MySQL, &amp; PHP. It’s a simple stack that all lived on one box. Unfortunately, that
box was stocked with a CPU that was measured in megahertz and memory that was
measured in megabytes. It was dog slow.</p><p>But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> promised a better future as computers became
exponentially faster. So why do we need more computers than ever before?</p><h3 id="where-it-went-wrong">Where it went wrong</h3><p>Since early web languages like PHP and Ruby were slow, you didn’t want them
running on your database server so you moved them to their own servers in what
is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier architecture</a>. Now you can keep adding more
stateless Ruby servers to this <em>presentation layer</em> and scale your application.</p><p>Database servers like Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL tended to be complicated to
operate so this architecture helped to isolate them. Scaling and managing
a fleet of database servers is a nighmare so organizations scale up their
database machine vertically as much as possible before they scaled horizontally
to multiple servers.</p><p>This n-tier architecture sounds simple at first but it has hidden complexity. On
a single machine, our server could add an in-memory cache to speed up requests
but now data is shared across multiple machines so we must add a <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a>
or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> server to share cached data. Database servers are easily overloaded
by numerous connections so we have to add intermediate services like
<a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a> to pool connections. If we have events in our system that must be
communicated to all our nodes then we need a cluster of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> machines.</p><p>Now we have a fleet of machines to manage. These systems have then caused an
explosion in infrastructure automation with tooling like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. All of
these layers slow us down from our job of writing software systems that solve
real problems.</p><p>What started as a simple two-tier software system has grown into a behemoth with
a dozen layers of complexity.</p><p>Complexity begets complexity.</p><h2 id="building-litestream">Building Litestream</h2><p>My background is in writing databases. Seven years ago, I wrote a pure Go,
embedded key/value store called <a href="http://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a> that has seen success in other
open-source applications that use it such as <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.</p><p>For a while, I used Bolt when writing applications and it was refreshing because
there were no depedencies to set up and performance was <em>blazingly fast</em>.
However, it lacked features like schema migration, a query language, or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> so it made application development difficult. But instead of going back
to database servers like Postgres, I turned to <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p><h3 id="moving-to-sqlite">Moving to SQLite</h3><p><em>“But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?"</em></p><p>No, there’s a growing movement of people that see the value of single process
applications. Expensify has run tests of <a href="https://blog.expensify.com/2018/01/08/scaling-sqlite-to-4m-qps-on-a-single-server/">4 million queries per second on a
single node</a> using SQLite. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcrawshaw">David Crawshaw</a> has a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqubKSF3wig">conference talk</a> and <a href="https://crawshaw.io/blog/one-process-programming-notes">blog post</a> on building
single process applications on SQLite. Django co-creator <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon
Willison</a> built a data exploration and publishing tool called
<a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> that’s built on SQLite.</p><p>SQLite is known for being bulletproof and having an <a href="https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/sqlite-testing">absurdly in-depth testing
suite</a>. It’s motto is <em>“Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three."</em></p><p>So why is SQLite considered a “toy” database in the application development
world and not a production database?</p><h3 id="that-one-big-issue">That one big issue</h3><p>The biggest problem with using SQLite in production is disaster recovery. If
your server dies, so does your data. That’s… not good.</p><p>Other database servers have replication so they can stream database changes to
another server in case one goes down. The best you can hope for with standard
SQLite is to run a nightly backup. Solutions like <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a> are great but
it requires a 3-node cluster.</p><p>Why can’t SQLite have a replication tool that’s as easy to use as SQLite?</p><h3 id="the-problem-litestream-solves">The problem Litestream solves</h3><p>I built Litestream to bring back sanity to application development. Litestream
is a tool that runs in a separate process and continuously replicates a SQLite
database to Amazon S3. You can get up and running with a few
lines of configuration. Then you can set-it-and-forget-it and get back to
writing code.</p><p>You might think this sounds expensive to continuously write to cloud storage
that provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.99% uptime</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.999999999% durability</a> but
it’s astoundingly cheap. Typical costs are only about $1 per month. Litestream
is free and open-source too so there’s never a license to pay for.</p><h3 id="but-i-need-100-uptime">But I need 100% uptime…</h3><p>The software industry has chased uptime as a goal in and of itself over the last
several decades. Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime
deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability
issues. <a href="https://k8s.af/">There’s even a web site dedicated to public postmortems related to
Kubernetes.</a></p><p>Most cloud providers provide multiple layers of redundancy in their systems to
protect against individual node and network failures. This doesn’t provide a
100% guarantee but will provide you with very high uptime servers. Anecdotally,
I’ve run several VPS servers over the years which all have well over 99.9%
uptime and have suffered no catastrophic failures.</p><h3 id="sounds-good-but-how-do-you-scale-this">Sounds good, but how do you scale this?</h3><p>Developers always want to know how to scale but that depends on their particular
application. Typically, you want to scale vertically first by simply increasing
amount of CPUs cores and RAM on your machine first.</p><p>Servers these days have a <em>ton</em> of power. I recently wrote a Go web application
with a SQLite database that would serve an HTTP request with multiple database
queries in under <em>50µs</em> on a $5/month VPS. That translates to thousands of
requests per second per core. SQLite scales reads well with the number of cores
on a machine. Amazon AWS has machines that can then scale up to 96 CPU cores and
hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.</p><p>If you exceed the capacity of a single node, sharding your data can allow you to
scale horizontally to multiple nodes. This works particularly well for SaaS
applications where each customer is isolated from one another. Because SQLite
and Litestream simplify deployment, managing a cluster of several isolated nodes
is easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-litestream">The Future of Litestream</h2><p>Litestream is helping to simplify application development but that’s only the
start of it. There are exciting features coming including replication to
<a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/8">read-only replicas</a>. This will give you the ability to run local
copies of your database at the edge to deliver requests instantly.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying out Litestream, the <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started">Getting
Started</a> can get you up and running in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>I’m interested to hear from others that want to simplify and improve application
development. If you have ideas or thoughts about the future of Litestream,
please get in touch on the <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions">GitHub Discussions board</a> and drop me a

<p>
  Cosmopolitan lets you build executables that run natively on seven
  operating systems. One of the first questions C/C++ developers ask is
  how much bloat does that entail? Is the Cosmopolitan Runtime lean and
  mean like Go's 2mb Hello World executables? Or is it a monster like
  Electron or those hundred megabyte OpenJDK shell scripts.

</p><p>
  The answer is it takes about 12kb. That's how big a statically-linked
  executable needs to be to run natively without dependencies on Linux,
  Mac, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and BIOS. Cosmopolitan is
  designed to let you build such programs. This page will demonstrate
  why the portability benefits Cosmopolitan provides have negligible
  performance impact and therefore only serve to save time while
  ensuring your work can reach a broader audience.

</p><p>
  The form below lets you build and visualize hello world programs with
  a customized support vector. It will show you exactly what goes into
  an <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html" title="Actually Portable Executable">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> that lets it integrate with so many systems.
  Since seeing is believing, the hope is that you'll choose to trust
  Cosmopolitan as your POSIX-comforming systems abstraction.

<h2><strong>While war corporations, or so-called “defense contractors,” make <u><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/">billions in profits</a></u>, Wall Street is the ultimate beneficiary of today’s nonstop wars. The prosaic nature of war profiteering—far from the work of a shadowy cabal—is precisely why the collusion is so destructive and should be outlawed.</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. ruling class deploys the military for three main reasons: (1) to forcibly open up countries to foreign investment, (2) to ensure the free flow of natural resources from the global south into the hands of multinational corporations, and (3) because war is profitable. The third of these reasons, the profitability of war, is often lacking detail in analyses of U.S. imperialism: The financial industry, including investment banks and private equity firms, is an insatiable force seeking profit via military activity.</p>



<p>The war industry is composed of corporations that sell goods and services to the U.S. government and allied capitalist regimes around the world. Investment banks and asset management firms hold most shares of every major public war corporation. </p>



<blockquote><p>The best-known financial firms holding the stock of war corporations include: Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Wellington Management.</p></blockquote>



<p>Consider Parsons, a corporation that sells goods and services pertaining to construction, command and control, espionage, and day-to-day military operations. Parsons’ initial public offering in May 2019, valued at roughly $3 billion, <a href="https://www.parsons.com/2020/09/parsons-ipo-recognized-as-deal-of-the-year-by-acg-national-capital/">earned it</a> an industry Corporate Growth Award. The top <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/psn/holders">holders</a> of Parsons stock are investment banks and asset management firms—including the familiar Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street.</p>

<h2><strong>Cyber Wars and Intelligence Go Mainstream as Emerging Corporate Frontiers</strong></h2>



<p>New business sectors of war are created and then flooded. For example, the provision of “cyber” was virtually nonexistent in U.S. military contracting until roughly four years ago. A war industry push to militarize IT infrastructure has yielded a bonanza in cyber contracts. Today, “cyber” goods and services are sold stand-alone or as additions to previous contracts.</p>



<p>Nearly every major war corporation sells cyber goods and services. </p>



<blockquote><p>The top public war corporations include Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, Boeing, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, Textron, SAIC, Booz Allen Hamilton, Leidos, CACI, Honeywell, PAE, Accenture, KBRWyle, Amentum, Jacobs, and AECOM.</p></blockquote>



<p>They all sell cyber. The main exception is Huntington Ingalls, a major shipbuilder, which does not sell stand-alone cyber goods, although it does mandate cybersecurity as part of its supply chain. The top private war corporations—Sierra Nevada Corp. and General Atomics, run by the billionaire Ozmens and Blue Brothers, respectively—also sell cyber goods and services.</p>



<p>This single business sector of war, cyber, is worth billions annually. <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/20/vips-memo-to-biden-dont-be-suckered-on-russia/">Claims</a> of Chinese and Russian cyber hacks, fabricated or hyped by war industry think tanks and media affiliates, fuel government purchases of cyber goods and services. For its part, the U.S. government—first to use devastating new weaponry, from <a href="https://libcom.org/history/1945-us-responses-atomic-bombing-hiroshima-nagasaki">atomic weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html">cyber weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html">first to attack</a> Moscow with cyber weapons—positions its aggression as purely defensive.</p>

<p>In November 2018, Parsons—whose <a href="https://www.parsons.com/about/leadership/">leadership</a> is packed with bankers, career war profiteers, military and intelligence retirees, and a coal tycoon—was <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/1686733/">contracted</a> for cyberspace operations mission planning in Centerville, Virginia. In May 2019, Parsons was <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/1842189/">contracted</a> with nine other corporations to expand the cyberspace backbone of the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific of San Diego, California, a military unit whose mandate is to dominate all forms of space (cyberspace, airspace, and Earth’s orbit).</p>



<p>In January 2020, Parsons and other corporations were <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2069174/">contracted</a> by the same unit to further develop, oversee, and employ broad cyber technology integral to that mandate, from the continental United States, to Guam, Japan, Australia, and Singapore, to Bahrain, Djibouti, and Italy. This is just one example of one corporation. Corporate America blankets U.S. military cyber operations worldwide.</p>

<p>No business sector of war is off limits. </p>



<blockquote><p>As recently as the early 1990s, it was considered sacrilege for corporate employees (“contractors”) to be involved in intelligence matters. Not anymore. U.S. intelligence (both civilian and military) is corporatized. </p></blockquote>



<p>Consider the Defense Intelligence Agency. DIA was established in the 1960s to consolidate the military’s disparate intelligence activities. It did not consolidate much, as the individual military branches continued to run distinct military-intelligence operations.</p>



<p>Since the 1960s, DIA has expanded dramatically in size. Corporations carrying out DIA’s activities during the most recent fiscal year included work in its Science &amp; Technology <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2099625/">Directorate</a> (five years, $990,000,000), its <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2190758/">National Media Exploitation Center</a>, and its <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2006604/">Missile &amp; Space Intelligence Center</a> (MSIC).</p>



<p>Parsons <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1515278/">carries out</a> modeling and simulation and analysis within DIA’s MSIC. Corporations also run planning and analysis of DIA’s <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2006604/">workforce</a>, sell <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2047884/">technical support</a> to DIA, <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2367105/">conduct</a> employee vetting and background investigations, and work on technology transfer analysis and assessment.</p>

<p>Corporations even develop and run <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2269384/">software</a> that aids “in the identification of intelligence requirements, management of priorities, planning and production of intelligence products, enterprise data analytics, communication and other associated processes,” offering further opportunities for profit-hungry entities to steer the espionage ship.

<h2><strong>Wall Street: the Ultimate War Profiteers</strong></h2>



<p>Wall Street plays the foundational role in the war industry by outright owning war corporations. Consider PAE, a subtle, potent corporation, which operates such diverse business sectors of war as vehicle maintenance, base operations, military construction, and military training. Gores Holdings III acquired PAE from Platinum Equity in early 2020. Gores then adopted the name PAE and took PAE public. PAE has since acquired the corporations CENTRA and Metis Solutions, which further increase PAE’s operations carrying out former governmental tasks within the U.S. military establishment and espionage agencies.</p>

<p>Again, all military and intelligence activity is up for grabs, even the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), a military range for testing and evaluating the war industry’s technology (e.g., anti-submarine weapons, sonar tracking, and communications). Some have nicknamed AUTEC the “Navy’s Area 51” because of the testing of high-tech unconventional weapons. [Area 51 is a testing range in Nevada where classified programs are worked on and experimental aircraft are flown.]</p>



<p>The Navy established AUTEC on Andros Island in the Bahamas to take advantage of the deep oceanic trench that runs along the east coast of the island. PAE is traditionally the go-to corporation that operates and maintains AUTEC, though a newly formed corporation known as Amentum recently <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2310984/">took over</a> some of these functions.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://www.suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Technology is merely a tool. It can work for us or against us. If we use it with agency, we can leverage the world’s information to better our lives. If we use it indiscriminately, we find ourselves at the mercy of the Algorithm, passively consuming content. Our generation is at an inflection point - either we use technology intentionally or it uses us.</p>

<p>This post is about one principle that transformed my relationship with technology: feeds considered harmful. Feeds slow you down, take you in unwanted directions and encourage consumption over action. Adopting the principle enabled me to effectively focus, prioritize and act on my goals.</p>

<p>A feed is a set of algorithmically generated content provided to the user without explicit input. Almost all of our interactions with services begin with a feed - Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, News. You name the app, it has a feed front and center. (Although this definition doesn’t include messaging apps or RSS feeds, some of the concerns below still hold.)</p>

<p>Feeds distract and slow you down. Ever catch yourself binging on The Office clips an hour after you open YouTube to learn how to revive your dying succulent? This is no accident - it’s the digital equivalent of placing the milk in the back of the grocery store. Even if you have a clear purpose for navigating to a site, it hijacks your attention with content the Algorithm has concluded you can’t resist. Instant gratification is only a click away.</p>

<p>If you’re mindlessly browsing, the effect of feeds is even more potent. The brief dopamine hit triggered by fresh content quickly evolves into analysis paralysis. Ever spend a half hour on Netflix just deciding what to watch? Then, shortly after a decision is made, feel a pang of buyer’s remorse? The abundance of options challenges the optimality of your choice, and in the face of the slightest obstacle, lures you to a replacement. Greener pastures are only a click away. And so begins the endless cycle of novelty and disillusion. The only way out is through - establishing an intent and following through.</p>

<p>You may be asking: don’t feeds broaden our exposure to new ideas? Yes, they do. But there’s no free lunch. Time spent consuming is time not spent doing. Taking meaningful action requires a delicate balance of explore and exploit. Feeds uproot this balance, disproportionately encouraging discovery instead of focused execution. This is best explained with a navigation analogy - explore is direction, exploit is movement. Explore is necessary in small doses, to make sure we’re moving in the right direction. Too much explore though, and we’ve over calibrated to our orientation - we’re no closer to our goal, but left with the illusion of progress (<em>cough</em> productivity porn <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>You can still explore without feeds. New ideas surface everywhere. In everyday conversations, which are inherently tailored to mutual interests. From resources in the exploit phase, as a springboard into complementary subjects. By browsing the library, a physical feed optimized for education instead of engagement. Instead of preventing exploration altogether, eliminating feeds recalibrates our explore-exploit balance by compelling us to adopt healthier forms of discovery that inevitably leave more energy for execution.</p>

<p>Speaking of execution, here’s how to reduce your dependence on feeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify your triggers</strong>: What feeds consume your attention the most? As a proxy, check your most visited sites on desktop (yes, that is a feed too!) or most used apps on mobile (Screen Time for iOS, Digital Wellbeing for Android).</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate the feed.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>(Ideal) Remove the feed entirely. The ideal page is blank, save for a search bar - intentional begins with intent! Such Chrome extensions exist for the most popular services: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, etc.</li>
      <li>(Backup) If the above isn’t entirely possible (say because you’re an active mobile user), add friction. A very effective solution is to uninstall the app and only access the service through the browser. Your muscle memory in the first few days will be a great reminder of how unconsciously you used these feeds, but it won’t take long to unlearn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Repeat for the new triggers that emerge.</strong> As your usual suspects are solved for, you will reach for new distractions. It will take a few cycles to fully eliminate them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects may include mild FOMO (which will soon subside), an enhanced feeling of control and excessive amounts of spare time to live life on your terms, not the Algorithm’s.</p>

<![CDATA[Uncovering a 24-year-old bug in the Linux Kernel]]>

February 11, 2021 | https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/uncovering-a-24-year-old-bug-in-the-linux-kernel/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/uncovering-a-24-year-old-bug-in-the-linux-kernel/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As part of our standard toolkit, we provide each developer at Skroutz
with a writable database snapshot against which she can develop. These
snapshots are updated daily through a pipeline that involves taking an
LVM snapshot of production data, anonymizing the dataset by stripping
all personal data, and transferring it via rsync to the development
database servers. The development servers in turn use ZFS snapshots to
expose a copy-on-write snapshot to each developer, with
self-service tools allowing rollback or upgrades to newer snapshots.</p>

<p>We use the same pipeline to expose MariaDB and MongoDB data, with a
full dataset size of 600GB and 200GB respectively, and a slightly
modified pipeline for Elasticsearch. While on-disk data changes
significantly for all data sources, rsync still saves significant time
by transferring roughly 1/3 of the full data set every night. This
setup has worked rather well for the better part of a decade and has
managed to scale from 15 developers to 150. However, as with most
systems, it has had its fair share of maintenance and has given us
some interesting moments.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting issues we encountered led to the discovery
of a fairly old bug in the Linux kernel TCP implementation: every now
and then, an rsync transfer from a source server would hang
indefinitely for no apparent reason, as — apart from the stuck transfer —
everything else seemed to be in order. What’s more, for reasons that became
apparent later, the issue could not be reproduced at will, although
some actions (e.g. adding an rsync-level rate limit) seemed to make
the issue less frequent, with frequency ranging from once or twice per
week to once every three months.</p>

<p>As is not unusual in these cases, we had more urgent systems and issues to
attend to, so we labeled this a “race condition in rsync” that we
should definitely look into at some point, and worked around it by
throttling the rsync transfers.</p>

<p>Until it started biting us every single day.</p>

<h2 id="rsync-as-a-pipeline">rsync as a pipeline</h2>

<p>While not strictly necessary, knowing how rsync works internally will help
understand the analysis that follows. The rsync site contains <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html">a thorough
description</a> of rsync’s internal architecture, so I’ll try to
summarize the most important points here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>rsync starts off as a single process on the client and a single
process on the server, communicating via a socket pair. When using
the rsync daemon, as in our case, communication is done over a
plain TCP connection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the direction of sync, after the initial handshake is
over, each end assumes a <em>role</em>, either that of the <em>sender</em>, or
that of the <em>receiver</em>. In our case the client is the receiver,
and the server is the sender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receiver forks an additional process called the <em>generator</em>,
sharing the socket with the <em>receiver</em> process. The <em>generator</em>
figures out what it needs to ask from the <em>sender</em>, and the
<em>sender</em> subsequently sends the data to the <em>receiver</em>. What we
essentially have after this step is a pipeline, <em>generator</em> →
<em>sender</em> → <em>receiver</em>, where the arrows are the two directions of
<em>the same</em> TCP connection. While there is some signaling involved,
the pipeline operates in a <em>blocking</em> fashion and relies on OS
buffers and TCP receive windows to apply backpressure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-ghost-in-the-network">A ghost in the network?</h2>

<p>Our first reaction when we encountered the issue was to suspect the
network for errors, which was a <em>reasonable</em> thing to do since we had
recently upgraded our servers and switches. After eliminating the
usual suspects (NIC firmware bugs involving TSO/GSO/GRO/VLAN
offloading, excessive packet drops or CRC errors at the switches etc),
we came to the conclusion that everything was normal and something
else had to be going on.</p>

<p>Attaching the hung processes using strace and gdb told us little: the
generator was hung on <code>send()</code> and the sender and receiver were hung
on <code>recv()</code>, yet no data was moving. However, turning to the kernel on
both systems revealed something interesting! On the client the rsync
socket shared between the <em>generator</em> and the <em>receiver</em> processes was
in the following state:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito dst :873

<p>while on the server, the socket state was the following:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito src :873
State      Recv-Q Send-Q                Local Address:Port                                 Peer Address:Port

<p>The interesting thing here is that there are 3.5MB of data on the
client, queued to be sent (❶ in the first output) by the
<em>generator</em> to the server; however, while the server has an empty <code>Recv-Q</code>
and can accept data, nothing seems to be moving forward. If <code>Recv-Q</code>
in the second output was non-zero, we would be looking at rsync on the
server being stuck and not reading from the network, however here it
is obvious that rsync has consumed all incoming data and is not to
blame.</p>

<p>So why is data queued up on one end of the connection, while the other end is
obviously able to accept it? The answer is conveniently hidden in the <code>timer</code>
fields of both <code>ss</code> outputs, especially in
<code>timer:(persist,1min56sec,0)</code>. Quoting <code>ss(8)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="man">-o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

              &lt;timer_name&gt;
                     the name of the timer, there are five kind of timer names:

                     on : means one of these  timers:  TCP  retrans  timer,  TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers</code></pre></div>

<p><code>persist</code> means that the connection has received a zero window
advertisement and is waiting for the peer to advertise a non-zero
window.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-zero-windows-and-zero-window-probes">TCP Zero Windows and Zero Window Probes</h2>

<p>TCP implements flow control by limiting the data in flight using a sliding
window called the <em>receive window</em>. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Flow_control">good description</a>, but in short each end of a TCP connection advertises how much
data it is willing to buffer for the connection, i.e. how much data the other
end may send before waiting for an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When one side’s receive buffer (<code>Recv-Q</code>) fills up (in this case
because the rsync process is doing disk I/O at a speed slower than the
network’s), it will send out a zero window advertisement, which will
put that direction of the connection on hold. When buffer space
eventually frees up, the kernel will send an unsolicited window update
with a non-zero window size, and the data transfer continues. To be
safe, just in case this unsolicited window update is lost, the other
end will regularly poll the connection state using the so-called Zero
Window Probes (the <code>persist</code> mode we are seeing here).</p>

<h2 id="the-window-is-stuck-closed">The window is stuck closed</h2>

<p>It’s now time to dive a couple of layers deeper and use <code>tcpdump</code> to
see what’s going on at the network level:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">[…]
09:34:34.165148 0c:c4:7a:f9:68:e4 &gt; 0c:c4:7a:f9:69:78, ethertype IPv6 (0x86dd), length 86: (flowlabel 0xcbf6f, hlim 64, next-header TCP (6) payload length: 32) 2001:db8:2a::3.38022 &gt; 2001:db8:2a::18.873: Flags [.], cksum 0x711b (incorrect -&gt; 0x4d39), seq 4212361595, ack 1253278418, win 16384, options [nop,nop,TS val 2864739840 ecr 2885730760], length 0

[… repeats every 2 mins]</code></pre></div>

<p>The first packet is the rsync client’s zero window probe, the second
packet is the server’s response. Surprisingly enough, the server is
advertising a non-zero window size of 13831 bytes¹ which the client
apparently ignores.</p>

<p>¹ actually multiplied by 128 because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option">window scaling</a> factor
of 7</p>

<p>We are finally making some progress and have a case to work on! At
some point the client encountered a zero window advertisement from the
server as part of regular TCP flow control, but then the window failed
to re-open for some reason. The client seems to be still ignoring
the new window advertised by the server and this is why the transfer
is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="linux-tcp-input-processing">Linux TCP input processing</h2>

<p>By now it’s obvious that the TCP connection is in a weird state on the
rsync client. Since TCP flow control happens at the kernel level, to
get to the root of this we need to look at how the Linux kernel
handles incoming TCP acknowledgments and try to figure out why it
ignores the incoming window advertisement.</p>

<p>Incoming TCP packet processing happens in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c"><code>net/ipv4/tcp_input.c</code></a>.Despite

<p>Let me say up front, I’m <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/09/a-word-on-anti-furry-sentiments-in-the-tech-community/">no stranger to negative or ridiculous feedback</a>. It’s incredibly hard to hurt my feelings, especially if you intend to. You don’t openly participate in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/23/never-underestimate-the-furry-fandom/">the furry fandom</a> since 2010 without being accustomed to malevolence and trolling. If this were simply a story of someone being an asshole to me, I would have shrugged and moved on with my life.</p>



<p>It’s important that you understand this, because when you call it like you see it, sometimes people dismiss your criticism with <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2016/04/triggered-a-personal-response-to-a-popular-meme/">“triggered” memes</a>. This isn’t me being offended. I promise.</p>



<hr>



<p>My recent blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/">crackpot cryptography</a> received a fair bit of attention in the software community. At one point it was on the front page of Hacker News (which is something that pretty much never happens for anything I write).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that also means I crossed paths with Zed A. Shaw, the author of <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> and other books often recommended to neophyte software developers.</p>



<p>As someone who spends a lot of time <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/">trying to help newcomers acclimate to the technology industry</a>, there are some behaviors I’ve recognized in technologists over the years that makes it harder for newcomers to overcome anxiety, frustration, and Impostor Syndrome. (Especially if they’re LGBTQIA+, a person of color, or a woman.)</p>



<p>Normally, these are easily correctable behaviors exhibited by people who have good intentions but don’t realize the harm they’re causing–often not by what they’re saying, but by how they say it.</p>



<p>Sadly, I can’t be so generous about… whatever <em>this</em> is:</p>

<p>Having never before encountered a living example of a poorly-written villain towards the work I do to help disadvantaged people thrive in technology careers, I sought to clarify Shaw’s intent.</p>

<p>This is effectively a very <em>weird</em> hybrid of an oddly-specific purity test and a form of hazing ritual.</p>



<p>Let’s step back for a second. Can you even fathom the damage attitudes like this can cause? I can tell you firsthand, because it happened to me.</p>



<h2 id="interlude">Interlude: Amplified Impostor Syndrome</h2>



<p>In the beginning of my career, I was just a humble web programmer. Due to a long story I don’t want to get into now, I was acquainted with the culture of black-hat hacking that precipitates the DEF CON community.</p>



<p>In particular, I was exposed the writings of a malicious group called <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/ZF0/">Zero For 0wned</a>, which made sport of hunting “skiddiez” and preached a very “shut up and stay in your lane” attitude:</p>



<blockquote><p>Geeks don’t really come to HOPE to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means, by a 15 year old. A combination of all the above could be why your room wasn’t full. Not only was it fairly empty, but it emptied at a rapid rate. I could barely take a seat through the masses pushing me to escape. Then when I thought no more people could possibly leave, they kept going. The room was almost empty when I gave in and left also. Heck, I was only there because we pwned the very resources you were talking about.</p><cite>Zero For 0wned</cite></blockquote>



<p>My first security conference was B-Sides Orlando in 2013. Before the conference, I had been hanging out in the #hackucf IRC channel and had known about the event well in advance (and got along with all the organizers and most of the would-be attendees), and considered applying to their CFP.</p>



<p>I ultimately didn’t, solely because I was worried about a ZF0-style reception. </p>



<p>I had no reference frame for other folks’ understanding of cryptography (which is my chosen area of discipline in infosec), and thought things like timing side-channels were “obvious”–even to software developers outside infosec. (Such is the danger of being self-taught!)</p>



<p>“Geeks don’t really come to B-Sides Orlando to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means,” is roughly how I imagined the vitriol would be framed.</p>



<p>If it can happen to me, it can happen to <em>anyone</em> interested in tech. It’s the responsibility of experts and mentors to spare beginners from falling into the trappings of other peoples’ grand-standing.</p>



<h2 id="arrogance">Pride Before Destruction</h2>



<p>With this in mind, let’s return to Shaw. At this point, more clarifying questions came in, this time from Fredrick Brennan.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OpenSSL had way more problems than only memory safety, but since you don't know about the various downgrade and SSL/TLS protocol issues you just outed yourself as knowing less about cryptography than me.</p><p>And, my whole point is you're no expert because you didn't see them.</p></div>— Zed A. Shaw, Writer (@lzsthw) <a href="https://twitter.com/lzsthw/status/1359712275666505734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>What an arrogant and bombastic thing to say!</p>



<p>At this point, I concluded that <a href="https://twitter.com/SoatokDhole/status/1359703488998105090">I can never again, in good conscience, recommend any of Shaw’s books to a fledgling programmer</a>.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever published book recommendations before, I suggest auditing them to make sure you’re not inadvertently exposing beginners to his harmful attitude and problematic behavior.</p>



<p>But while we’re on the subject of Zed Shaw’s behavior…</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>This is actually the dude’s pinned tweet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Shaw thinks of himself as a superior cryptography expert, surely he’s published cryptography code online before.</p>



<p>And surely, it will withstand a five-minute code review from a gay furry blogger who never went through Shaw’s prescribed hazing ritual to rediscover specifically the known problems in OpenSSL circa Heartbleed and is therefore not as much of a cryptography expert?</p>







<h2 id="zero-day">May I Offer You a Zero-Day in This Trying Time?</h2>



<p>One of Zed A. Shaw’s Github projects is <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin">an implementation of SRP</a> (Secure Remote Password)–an early Password-Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm often integrated with TLS (to form TLS-SRP).</p>

<p>Without even looking past the directory structure, we can already see that it implements <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/master/t_truerand.c">an algorithm called TrueRand</a>, which cryptographer Matt Blaze has this to say:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tqbf</a> Also: please nobody use truerand.

</div><figcaption>You should be <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">using /dev/urandom</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by the README, Shaw stripped out all of the “extraneous” things and doesn’t have all of the previous versions of SRP “since those are known to be vulnerable”.</p>



<p>So given Shaw’s previous behavior, and the removal of vulnerable versions of SRP from his fork of Tom Wu’s libsrp code, it stands to reason that Shaw believes the cryptography code he published would be secure. Otherwise, why would he behave with such arrogance?</p>



<h3>SRP in the Grass</h3>

<p>When I say SRP, I’m referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP-6a</a>. Earlier versions of the protocol are out of scope; as are proposed variants (e.g. ones that employ SHA-256 instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Professor Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University (who incidentally used to proverbially shit on OpenSSL in the way that Shaw expects everyone to, except productively) <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">dislikes SRP but considered the protocol “not obviously broken”</a>.</p>



<p>However, a secure protocol doesn’t mean the implementations are always secure. (Anyone who’s looked at older versions of OpenSSL’s BigNum library after reading my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/">guide to side-channel attacks</a> knows better.)</p>



<p>There are a few ways to implement SRP insecurely:</p>



<ol><li>Use an insecure random number generator (e.g. TrueRand) for salts or private keys.</li><li>Fail to use a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#appendix-A">secure set of parameters</a> (q, N, g).<p>To expand on this, SRP requires q be a Sophie-Germain prime and N be its corresponding Safe Prime. The standard Diffie-Hellman primes (MODP) are not sufficient for SRP.</p><p>This security requirement exists because SRP requires an algebraic structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">ring</a>, rather than a cyclic group (as per Diffie-Hellman).</p></li><li>Fail to perform the critical validation steps <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-3.1">as outlined in RFC 5054</a>.</li></ol>



<p>In one way or another, Shaw’s SRP library fails at every step of the way. The first two are trivial:</p>



<ol><li>We’ve already seen the RNG used by srpmin. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/paper-prngs.pdf">TrueRand is not a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator</a>.</li><li>Zed A. Shaw’s srpmin <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/217ec0a968a551fe6452c9bef7b37b38e165c94f/t_conf.c#L39-L107">only supports unsafe primes</a> for SRP (i.e. the ones from RFC 3526, which is for Diffie-Hellman).</li></ol>



<p>The third is more interesting. Let’s talk about the RFC 5054 validation steps in more detail.</p>



<h4 id="srp6a-validation">Parameter Validation in SRP-6a</h4>



<p>From a client’s perspective, you must verify that <code>(B % N) != 0</code>. This is critical to the security of SRP. This check <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00043000000000000000">prevents dictionary attacks on the password from a man-in-the-middle</a>.</p>



<p>From the server’s (or a peer’s) perspective, you must also verify <code>(A % N) &gt; 0</code> to prevent the server’s session key from being forced to a known value (i.e. zero).</p>



<p>Additionally, the value <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032400000000000000"><code>u</code> must not be revealed by the server until the client has sent <code>A</code></a>. It must also not be set to <code>0</code>. Failure to uphold these constraints can allow clients to impersonate their peers.</p>



<p>These are obvious and well-known SRP constraints first published in 1997 by Tom Wu.</p>

Popular air purifier brands are making a lot of promises about what they can do to keep your home safe, but a CBC <em>Marketplace</em> investigation found that a homemade DIY purifier can actually outperform some of the most well-known brands on the market.</p>  <p>There are plenty of claims for consumers to wade through: "the only air purifier, heater&nbsp;and fan to clean a whole room properly;" "UV-C light killing germs;" and "true HEPA filter" are just some of the promises <em>Marketplace </em>investigated.</p>  <p>University of Toronto engineering professor Jeffrey Siegel, a leading expert on ventilation, filtration and indoor air quality, calls it "a marketing jungle."</p>  <p>Working with Siegel and his team, <em>Marketplace</em> put five popular brands to the test: the Levoit LV-H132, GermGuardian AC5350B, Dyson Pure Hot + Cool, BlueAir Blue Pure 211+ and the Honeywell HPA 160, as well as a DIY box fan with an added filter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Air purifier sales in Canada jumped nine per cent in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic 2019, totalling $136 million, according to statistics from market research firm Euromonitor.</p>  <h2>Clearing out COVID-19</h2>  <p>Siegel said a good air purifier can also help clear out coronavirus particles and reduce the air's viral load.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Jeffrey Siegel is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who has been studying indoor air quality for over 20 years.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Anu Singh/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But air purifiers need to be efficient and sized appropriately for the space they are in. Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too. Viruses such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often attach themselves to dust or droplets, and a good air purifier with a HEPA filter can help capture them.</p>  <p>All <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1"><u>HEPA filters</u></a> are supposed to remove at least 99.97 per cent of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and airborne particles. All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke in 24.0 m³ chamber, Siegel and his team <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers</a> — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products. Here’s what we found.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:09</span></span></span></p>  <p>The CADR measures how long an air-purifying device takes to remove pollen, smoke and dust; different CADR numbers correspond to each one. The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms. The smoke CADR is generally the lowest and most conservative number, said Siegel.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;|&nbsp;Here's how our test worked:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854855747661-metadata-" title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/481/295/mp_amy_embedded_xcode_mix_320_frame_856.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>University of Toronto PhD student Amy Li explains how the lab calculates the clean air delivery rate.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:33</span></span></span></p>  <p>Siegel also threw another set of air purifiers into the mix — a do-it-yourself version that consists of a box fan and a filter, taped together with painter's tape.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We’re announcing <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base"><code>linear-base</code></a>,
a standard library for <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">Linear Haskell</a> programs.
Our release accompanies the release of <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/status/ghc-9.0.1">GHC
9.0</a> which supports <code>-XLinearTypes</code>. Linear base has been
written by Bhavik Mehta, a former Tweag intern, Arnaud Spiwack, and ourselves.</p>
<p>In the spirit of a standard library, <code>linear-base</code> is not a strict replica of
<code>base</code> with linearly-typed variants of all the facilities in <code>base</code>. Instead,
<code>linear-base</code> focuses on the abstractions one naturally <em>needs</em> and <em>desires</em>
when programming with linear types.</p>
<p>It does include some linear variants from <code>base</code>, but the library
ranges from mutable data structures with a pure API to a resource-safe I/O
monad, to linear-streams. It’s a “base” library, a helpful
prelude to programming using <code>-XLinearTypes</code>.</p>
<p>Of course this raises the question, what does a linear Haskell program look like?
And, how does <code>linear-base</code> provide what we <em>need</em> and what we <em>want</em> to write one?</p>
<h2>Envisioning Linear Haskell Programs</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <code>-XLinearTypes</code>, you can learn more by
browsing our
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">README</a>.
At a bare-bones level, linear types simply
provide some further properties that a function declared with a signature like <code>f :: A %1-&gt; B</code> must satisfy. Namely, to type-check the body of <code>f</code>,
the <code>A</code> must be consumed exactly once. We are then able to leverage this
type-checking power to write functions that would have been unsafe to write
before (e.g., a pure interface to mutable data structures) or provide
alternative APIs to existing ones that place an obligation on the programmer to
ensure they avoid certain errors (such as reading from a closed file handle).
For more information about how <code>-XLinearTypes</code> works see our <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/tags/linear-types/">earlier
posts</a>.</p>
<p>There are two main families of motivations for this additional type-checking discussed
in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756">Linear Haskell paper</a>. First, we can write pure
APIs for mutable data structures such as arrays. As discussed in the paper,
this approach is sometimes more convenient to work with than using the
<code>ST</code> monad, and even makes <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.4.0/docs/Data-Array-Unsafe.html#v:unsafeFreeze"><code>unsafeFreeze</code></a> safe.</p>
<p>Second, <code>-XLinearTypes</code> enables us to type-check usage protocols.
An example discussed in the paper is the protocol of file handles, namely, that
file handles must be closed and then cannot be written to or read from<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, a typical linear program would likely be one that</p>
<ul>
<li>is mostly pure, but has a piece of state to use throughout. Using
linear types avoids that an <code>ST</code> monad invades
the larger, pure, part of the program</li>
<li>is resource-heavy and requires a non-trivial amount of reasoning on the part
of the programmer to ensure resource protocols are upheld.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we can envision a standard library as one that has the
<strong>linear gadgets we <em>want</em></strong>, like pure-interfaced mutable data structures and
resource-safe APIs, and the <strong>utilities we <em>need</em></strong>, like a linear <code>($)</code>, to
write a typical linear program.</p>
<h2>What we want: linear abstractions or use-cases!</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> comes equipped with a pure API for mutable <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Mutable/Linear.hs">arrays</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Vector/Mutable/Linear.hs">vectors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/HashMap/Linear.hs">hashmaps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Set/Mutable/Linear.hs">sets</a>.
These enable us to write a mutable implementation of

<p>This code reads rather like an imperative
program, where <code>arr</code> is updated through <code>arr</code>, <code>arr1</code>, <code>arr2</code> and so on.
Compared to using the <code>ST</code> monad, we lose the ability to share the
effect of mutations, in exchange we gain a pure interface, which can
be less invasive.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> has a resource-safe <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/System/IO/Resource.hs">File I/O API</a> that ensures that file
handles, for instance, are closed and then no longer used.</li>
<li><code>linear-base</code> includes a <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/src/Streaming">linear variant</a> of the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming">streaming</a> library, which is compatible with the
resource-safe I/O monad, to ensure that resources accessed in the
monadic layers of streams have their protocols obeyed and that the protocols
of streams themselves are enforced. If the effects in streams can be repeated
more than once, we could, say, repeat the effect of reading from a file handle
after that handle is closed. Hence, we use control monads inside linear streams
to ensure monadic effects are performed exactly once. This is based
on
<a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-06-21-linear-streams/">the work</a> of Edvard Hübinette, for the Haskell Summer
of Code of 2018.</li>
<li>In order to define such resource-safe protocols, <code>linear-base</code> provides
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Linear.hs">control monads</a> and related monadic functions like <code>foldM</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we need: linear utilities!</h2>
<p>Of course, <code>linear-base</code> includes various abstractions that many
linear programs will end up using, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variants of <code>base</code> abstractions like a linear <code>Num</code>, linear <code>Functor</code>s (in <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-01-16-data-vs-control/">two
flavors</a>), a linear <code>Data.List</code> API, and linear versions of
standard <code>Prelude</code> functions like <code>($)</code>.</p>
<p>We need these because functions as simple as</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will only type-check if <code>(*)</code> and <code>(+)</code> have linear arrows. Similarly, using
standard abstractions from <code>base</code>, like functors, <code>($)</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldl</code>, will
not work inside many functions that have linear arguments.</p>
<p>As a special note, we use a linear <code>(&amp;)</code> for a workaround to the
current limitation that all case statements consume the scrutinee (the <code>x</code> in
<code>case x of</code>) unrestrictedly. See the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user guide</a> for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms to interface linear and non-linear code: <code>linear-base</code> comes with
<code>Ur</code>, which stands for unrestricted and lets you manipulate a
non-linear value in a linear context.
Hence, a function <code>f :: Ur a %1-&gt; b</code> can use the <code>a</code>
unrestrictedly after pattern matching on <code>(Ur x)</code>. Alongside this,
<code>linear-base</code> comes with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Unrestricted/Linear.hs">classes</a> <code>Consumable</code>, <code>Dupable</code> and
<code>Movable</code> which allow non-linear use of linearly-bound values; one can
<code>consume</code>, duplicate (possibly with <code>dup2 :: a %1-&gt; (a,a)</code>) or, <code>move</code> a
linearly bound value.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>consume</span> <span>::</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>dup2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Dupable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
  <span>move</span> <span>::</span> <span>Movable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ur</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are used throughout <code>linear-base</code> itself and are likely to
show up in linearly types programs. For instance,
the linearly-typed streaming function <code>chain</code> has
the following type</p>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>chain</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>y</span><span> . </span><span>(</span><span>Control.Monad</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>

<p>because the <code>y</code> must be discarded as the monadic effect is chained
after each <code>a</code> in the stream.</p>
<h2>Advanced abstractions &amp; sneak peeks</h2>
<p>Finally, <code>linear-base</code> has several features still in the works. Please note
that some of these features like non-GC memory allocation, destination arrays
and push-pull arrays are still very experimental and likely to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Optics/Linear/Internal.hs">optics</a> are optics re-designed to work in linear contexts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Foreign/Marshal/Pure.hs">Non-GC memory allocation</a>. We can use linear types to enforce the protocols for
using memory outside of GHC’s garbage collector and on the system heap, i.e., that
we allocate before use, necessarily free and do not use after that. Hence, the GC has
less work to do and we as programmers have the control over some allocation which
could impact the performance of our program.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Destination.hs">Destination arrays</a>. Destination arrays, provide a way to write code in
destination-passing-style. This lets us decide when we allocate space
for a write-only array that’s threaded throughout our program. If we instead
had just used a vector, we might not have had all the fusion we’d like and might
have had extra allocations which impact memory use and performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Polarized.hs">Push-pull arrays</a>. We can use linear-types to represent
<a href="https://jyp.github.io/posts/controlled-fusion.html">polarized arrays</a>. This enables us to provide a <code>vector</code>-like
API but explicitly control when allocation occurs. With the existing
<code>vector</code> library, one is often relying on array fusion to avoid
unnecessary allocations, but it can be hard to predict when array
fusion occurs. Polarized arrays can be either
output-friendly (a push array) or input-friendly (a pull
array) and neither form allocates. Only when a regular array is needed does
one <em>explicitly</em> allocate. So, controlling allocation is done by
the programmer, not the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community first</h2>
<p>Our goal with <code>linear-base</code> is to make it easy and fun for the community to
write Linear Haskell programs. The first release is available on
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base">Hackage</a> and comes with <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> from
the repository, and, in addition to the haddock, a short <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user
guide</a>. Please feel welcome to <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/issues">point out bugs or request
features</a>. To check out the latest update, see <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base">our GitHub

          <h2>Why this tool?</h2>
          <p>
            TL;DR; to help reduce the environmental footprint of the digital
            world
          </p>
        </header>
        <p>
          This tool aim to humbly participate in stopping the race for ever more
          quality and bandwidth (8K resolution, 5G network, etc.) by offering a
          simple way to radically reduce the size of a video.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital world’s contribution to the footprint of humanity is
          currently around 4% (see
          <a href="https://www.greenit.fr/environmental-footprint-of-the-digital-world/" target="_blank">this report from GreenIT.fr</a>
          and
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">this another report from The Shift Project</a>). This is more than
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/" target="_blank">the aviation</a>, and it is predicted to grow in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online video does <b>NOT</b> represent the main impact of the digital
          world, <b>manufacturing is a much bigger deal</b>. But reducing the
          size of a video can help <b>keeping our old devices</b> that have
          limited bandwidth and limited computing power, instead of buying new
          ones.

          <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>
          Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160 kbits/s)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Shift Project has published a guide for reducing the size of a
          video while maintaining a good quality
        </p>
        <p>
          You can download it
          <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/guide-reduce-weight-video-5-minutes/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, it reduces the video resolution to 720p and the audio
          bitrate to 160 kbits/s. The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) is set to 22.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video resolution (480p)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the video resolution to 480p. Don't watch it on your 4K TV,
          otherwise it is OK.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 28. You won't see tiny
          details but the essential is there.
        </p>
        <h3>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</h3>
        <p>
          It reduces the audio bitrate to 160 kbits/s. If the audio is mainly
          speeches, it should remain audible.
        </p>
        <h3>One image every 5 seconds (!)</h3>
        <p>
          For some videos, like conferences, there is not much action and you
          can easily understand what happens even with one image every 5 seconds
        </p>
        <h3>Black and white</h3>
        <p>Aesthetic and lightweight</p>

          <h2>How it works?</h2>
          <p>Let's get into the technical details</p>
        </header>
        <p>
          This tool uses
          <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/" target="_blank">FFMPEG.WASM</a>
          to edit the video directly in the browser!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can dowload
          <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFMPEG</a>
          to try these settings directly on your computer
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Apply settings from The Shift Project (720p, CRF 28, 160
            kbits/s)</b>
        </p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd720 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" -c:a aac -b:a 160k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video resolution (480p)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s hd480 -c:v libx264 -crf 22 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower video quality (CRF 28)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -vf "scale=iw*sar:ih,setsar=1" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Lower audio bitrate (56 kbits/s)</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 56k output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>One image every 5 seconds</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=fps=1/5" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p><b>Black and white</b></p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "hue=s=0" output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p>
          This whole approach is inspired by image dithering (see
          <a href="https://ditherit.com/" target="_blank">here</a> for an
          example), which removes a lot of data in the image while preserving
          its essential meaning

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

</ul>

<p>I promised I’ll post stuff about low level hardware issues, and here is my second post on the subject, the first part in a series about the Intel graphics stack.</p>

<p>This post series will be a summary of about a decade of unpublished research I am trying to organize and share.
Not all of it is current, as newer hardware is harder to inspect and reverse, but I think much of the research is relevant.</p>

<p>The first post below is a quick introduction to the different components on the hardware and software side we’ll need to dive into security issues in the next post.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Processor graphics - The graphics unit that is part of the processor itself. Has had many codenames over the years, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris, Gen9, Gen11, Intel Xe and so on. Even the ‘Gen’ name has double meaning - both generation and ‘Graphics ENgine’. In UEFI code it is sometimes referet to at the IGD - Integrated Graphics Device.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The GuC - an embedded i486 core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>UEFI and OS Drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>As discussed in the introduction to the SecureBoot post, the Intel CPU has four major component groups - the CPU cores, the L3 (or LLC) cache slices, the ‘Uncore’ or ‘System Agent’ parts, all connected through a ring bus inside the die.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics process is made up from several <em>slices</em> and an <em>unslice</em> (like <em>uncore</em>) area that includes common components.
Each slice is divided into subblices and a slice common area. The subslices are made up of several Execution Units (EUs), and Texture unit and a L1 Cache/Memory. The common area includes the L3 cache and the dataport.
The limit to the number of slices is the interconnect between them and the unslice. 
There is always only a single <em>unslice</em>. In the unslice we can find the connection to the ring bus, aptly named the GT interface (GTI), the <em>Command Streamer</em> is reads commands from the system memory and into the graphics processor, the <em>fixed function pipline</em> (FF pipeline), and the thread dispatcher \&amp; spawner that lunch shader programs and GPGPU (General Purpose Comuting) programs onto the EUs. The FF pipeline deals with fixed functions such as vertice operations (called the Geometry Pipe), and other dedicated hardware such as video transcoding.</p>

<p>Different SKUs have different combinations of these. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Skylake GT2: 1 slice of 3 subslices of 8 EUs (1x3x8)</li>
  <li>Skylake GT3: 2x3x8</li>
  <li>Skylake GT4: 3x3x8</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gen9slice.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<p>The graphics engine is also connect streight to the the IOSF (Intel On Chip Fabric internal bus, see the <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/04/secure-boot.html">secureboot post</a> bus, through a controller called Gunit.  Gunit is connect to both the primary and secondary IOSF and exports functions for communicating with the graphics engine and implementing IOMMU support for graphics memory and unified memory.</p>

<p>All of this is connected to the the display IO interconnect and output to DisplayPort and HDMI outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gunit.png" alt="Gen9 Architecture"></p>

<h2 id="2d-graphics-pipeline">2D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The 2D graphics gengine is a standonle IP block in the <em>unslice</em> area, and has its own command streamer, registers and cache. It has 256 different operation codes, for example:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/2dops.png" alt="2D BitBlt Operations"></p>

<h2 id="3d-graphics-pipeline">3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The fixed function pipeline in the <em>unslice</em> implements the DirectX 11 redndering pipeline stages: 
Vertex Fetch -&gt; Vertex Shader -&gt; Hull Shader -&gt; Tessellator -&gt; Domain Shader -&gt; Geometry Shader -&gt; Clipper -&gt; Windower -&gt; Z Ordering, -&gt; Pixel Shader - &gt;Pixel Output. Some of these functions are self contained, but many are implemented using by running shader programs on the EUs in the slices. EUs can send certain operations back into dedicated hardware units.</p>

<h2 id="the-execution-units-eus">The Execution Units (EUs)</h2>
<p>The EUs are in-order mulithreaded SIMD processing core. Each execution thread is dispatched has its own 128 register space and executed programs called “kernels”. All instructions are 8 channels wide, e.g. operate on 8 registers at a time (or 16 half registers). Its supports arithmetic, logical and control flow instructions on floats and ints. Registers are addressed by address.
The EU thread dispatcher implements priorities based on age, i.e. oldest is hight priority, and whether the trhead is blocked waiting on instruction fetches, register dependencies etc’. C</p>


<p>The GuC is a small embedded core that supports graphics sechduling, power managment and firmware attestation.
It is implemented in an i486DX4 CPU (also called P24C and Minute IA), altough it seems that since broadwell it has been extended to the Pentium (i586) ISA. It runs a small microkernel call μOS. 
The GuC μOS runs only kernel level tasks (even though μOS supports μApps). The firmware is written in C with not stdlib.
In the GuC we can find supporting blocks: ROM memory, 8KB L1 on core cache, 64KB/128KB/256KB (Broadwell/Skylake/CannonLake) of SRAM  memory which is used for code+data+cache and a 8KB stack. It also has power managment, DMA engine, etc’. 
Communication to the GuC is done through memory-mapped IO and bidirectional interrupts.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/guc.png" alt="GuC architecture"></p>

<p>The GuC offers a light-weight mechanism for dispatch work the host submits to the GPU. This means the GPU driver does not need to handle dispatch and job queuing, making it much faster. The <em>user mode driver (UMD)</em> can communicate with the GuC directly when required and bypass the need to context switch the main CPU into kernel mode. The <em>kernel mode driver (KMD)</em> uses the GuC as a gateway for job submission as well. This simplifies the Kernel and provides a single point where all jobs are submitted.
Communication between the UMD and the GuC is done through shared memory queues.</p>

<p><em>Why is the GuC interesting? Because I think it can communicate with the CSME, CPU and GPU and everything over the IOSF, and if it has bugs it can be used to gain very privileged access to the system and memory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="boot-rom-and-guc-firmware">Boot ROM and GuC firmware</h2>
<p>At system startup GuC is held at reset state until the UEFI firmware initializes the shared memory regtion for the GPU. Inside the shared region a special subregion call WOPCM is set aside fur GuC (and HuC) firmware. It then releases the GuC from reset and it in turn starts executing a small non-modifiable Boot ROM (16/32KB in size) that initializes the basic GuC hardware, and waits for an interupt signalling the firmware has been copied to the WOPCM region.
The GuC firmware is an opaque blob supplied by Intel as part of the GPU KMD, which copies it to the shared memory region (GGTT) and signals the Boot ROM with an interrupt. The bootrom verifies the firmware with a digital signature using a SHA256 hash + PKCSv2.1 RSA signature, and if the test passes copies it to SRAM and starts executing.</p>

<p>The GUC firmware can be extracted from the graphics driver and reversed. Screenshot of IDA open on the kabylake GuC:
<img src="https://igor-blue.github.io/images/gucfirmware.png" alt="GUC firmware"></p>

<p>The GuC also attest the firmware for the video decoder unit, called <em>HuC</em>. The HuC is an HEVC/H.265 decoded implement in hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-μos-kernel">The μOS kernel</h2>
<p>The μOS kernel runs in 32-bit protected mode, with no paging and old-style segments model (CS, DS, etc’). All code run in ring0. The OS handles HW/SW exceptions and crashes, and supplies debugging and logging services.</p>

<p>Interrupts are handled through the local APIC - I found interrupts coming from the IOMMU, power managment, display interfaces, the GPU and the CPU.</p>

<p>It runs a single process - which initializes the system and then waits for interrupts/events in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="communication-with-the-os">Communication with the OS</h2>
<p>Commands are dispatched through a ring buffer work queue. Each work item has a header followed by a command. Once a command is posted the CPU notifies the GuC using a “doorbell” interrupt.</p>

<p>The Windows kernel mode driver supports GuC debugging by setting a registry key:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
	GuCEnableUkLogging=1
    
\\REGISTRY\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\KMD\GuC\\
    GuCLoggingVerbositySelect=0/1/2/3 (low, medium, high, max)
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>So far we only discussed hardware. The software part of the graphics stack is divided into three levels: UEFI DXE, kernel mode and user mode.</p>

<h2 id="uefi">UEFI</h2>
<p>Traditionally VGA support was implemented with a legacy Video VBIOS as an PCI option ROM. In UEFI VBIOS was modified into a DXE driver call the <em>Graphics Output Protocol</em> (<em>GOP</em>), which support basic display for the UEFI setup menu and for the OS bootloader. The GOP is supplied by Intel to the UEFI vendor. 
The GOP supplies two basic functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the graphics mode - resultion, pixel depth, etc’</li>
  <li>Getting the physical address of the framebuffer</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows boot-loader uses the GOP to setup a memory mapped video framebuffer before entering VBS, and after the hypervisor and SK are loaded the access by winload is only through the framebuffer without invoking the GOP. Windows also uses the GOP for disablig blue screens.</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>On Windows, Intel supplies a fairly large graphics driver that implements both the user mode driver (UMD) and kernel mode driver (UMD). Applications using Direct3D communicate through the D3D runtime to the DXGI abstraction interface (in dxgkrnl.sys), which in turn communicated with the KMD. The KMD treats 2D Blt and 3D operations through different pipelines and dispatches the operations to the GPU.</p>

<p>The GPU driver is riddled with telemetry, but I haven’t figured out yet how much of it is sent automatically to Intel, altough crashes are sent through OCA - Online Crash Analysis.</p>

<h2 id="basic-memory-managment">Basic Memory Managment</h2>
<p>A very important job of the graphics drivers (both KMD and UMD) is memory managment (GMM). The Graphics Memory space is the virtual memory allocated to the GPU, and is translated using the system pages tables to the physical RAM. The memory contains stuff lime geometry data, textures, etc’. The GPU hardware used Graphics Page Tables (GTTs) to decode virtual addresses supplied by the software graphics memory space into …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed">https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed</a></p>
<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/</a></p>
<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>

<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet</a></p>
<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id</a></p>
<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>
