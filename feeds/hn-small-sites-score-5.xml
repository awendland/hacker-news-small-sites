July 24, 2020 | https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

    <p>
      Few days ago I was browsing HN and found an article about how fire is implemented in DOOM
      <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/">http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/</a>. It’s very simple and the result is surprisingly good. I cannot stop but trying to
      implemented in JavaScript right away. I managed to get it working and added some extra
      controls. Since I found the original article still need a bit digestion to understand. I want
      to talk about how it is implemented in my own (hopefully even simpler) words.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Basic_4"></a>The Basic</h2>
    <p>
      To make fire in a pixel grid, the basic idea is that, we traverse each pixel and update each
      pixel above them to be “cooler”. And we do it over and over again. This way, if we set all
      bottom line of pixels to “hottest”. we can see just sit and let it grow up. Like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>If we make it bigger and put fire's color on it, based on the number. It looks like this.</p>

    

    <h2><a id="The_Trick_16"></a>The Trick</h2>
    <p>
      But that doesn’t really look like fire, it’s too “linear”. The trick to make it look like fire
      is adding some randomness on how the fire “grow” up.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, instead of always make the above pixel “cooler”, we only do it by 50% chance. So 50%
      chance the above pixel will be cooler, and 50% the above pixel won't change. It looks like
      this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      It looks better. Next, when we look for the above pixel, instead of going straight up, we can
      add a shift to left or right randomly. In code, when we traverse each pixel, find the pixel
      above, then either, update that pixel, or update the one on its left, or update the one on its
      right. The result looks like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      Now it starts to look like fire. Let's try to add more pixels and render it on canvas instead
      of HTML to get a better performance. We will also get ride of the pixel border and number.
    </p>

    

    <h2><a id="Control_fire_34"></a>Control fire</h2>
    <h3><a id="wind_36"></a>wind</h3>
    <p>
      In the original article, the author left an exercise for readers to simulate wind. If you get
      the idea how the fire is generated, it’s pretty straight forward to know wind can be
      simulated. All we need to do adjust the shift of left or right when update the above pixel. If
      we shift more to the left, it will cause the pixel leaning toward left, which makes it look
      like there is a wind blow from right to left. And the same goes to the other way.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Fade_the_fire_40"></a>Fade the fire</h3>
    <p>
      Fading the fire can be simulated by gradually updating the bottom section of the pixel to be
      “cooler”. It will not only “fade” the bottom section but also “fade” all the pixels above,
      because they are propagated.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="fire_intensity_44"></a>fire intensity</h3>
    <p>
      Fire intensity basically means how long does it take for a pixel to get “cool down” as it
      propagates up. Currently, we set it to be 50% chance to cool down. So if we want the fire to
      be more “intense”, we just need to make let less possible to cool down.
    </p>
    <p>You can try to control the fire here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>First, at Repl.it we're not motivated by competition. What we care about the most is making programming and computing more accessible. That means anyone who wants to code and build things should be able to do so without any hurdles.</p>
<p>Recently, Glitch, one of our competitors focusing on JavaScript, has blocked pinging services from reaching user apps. Among other things it means they broke the Discord bot experience for their users. We don't have any insight on why they did that but it seems part of a larger change they're going through which also resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268007/glitch-layoffs-substantial-number-coding-platform-union">layoffs</a>. </p>
<p>That resulted in a user influx to Repl.it so I wanted to write this to welcome you to Repl.it and tell you a little about us.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/glitch.png" alt="users posting on glitch forum about repl.it"></p>
<p>Repl.it has existed since 2011 and we've been growing the service in a sustainable way that doesn't result in disruptive changes. Building a service like ours is hard, especially for a small team like ours, and we're constantly improving and making things better. But our absolute top priority is being a place coders can depend on -- we will try our absolute best to never let you down.</p>
<p>Because many people are asking us, as co-founders &amp; CEO I want to make a promise to you that we will never block pinging services or make any abrupt changes that will break your apps. We built our infrastructure in a way that doesn't make it super expensive on us to ping your repl to keep it up. </p>
<p>We have a new feature coming out for Hacker plan subscribers that will make repls even more reliable that they wouldn't need pinging in the first place. But we will never ban pinging to force people to upgrade by taking away features.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>First <a href="https://repl.it/glitch">import your Glitch projects</a></li>
<li>While many projects will work out of the box, some might not. So to learn about Repl.it and how it works hit up our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/">documentation</a></li>
<li>If you run into any problem you can post on our <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask">Q&amp;A forums</a></li>
<li>Join our <a href="https://repl.it/discord">Discord community</a></li>
<li>Learn how to make and host bots on Repl.it: <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-node-js-and-repl-it-mm46r1u8y">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz">Python</a>, <a href="https://repl.it/@templates/discordgo">Go</a>, and you can find others on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-replit">What is Repl.it?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> stands for "read-eval-print-loop" which roughly means an interactive programming environment. Repl.it was started in 2011 to provide repls for as many languages as humanly possible. With time we also added <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a>, <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">collaboration</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/gfx">graphics</a>, <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">domains</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/github">Git</a>, and much more that made Repl.it not only a great programming environment, but also a place to build and host apps. You can explore what our awesome community is making <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our mission is to make programming more accessible, and to build tools for creators and makers like yourself. While we have fun building our service, we take our mission and goals very seriously. </p>
<p>While we're already one of the largest coding websites on the internet, we're only getting started. We want to make the most fun and engaging way to learn how to code, to build apps, and to connect and collaborate with other hackers. </p>
<p>My email is always open, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78191512191c380a1d081456110c"><span data-cfemail="d2b3bfb8b3b692a0b7a2befcbba6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>, and I'd love to hear from you, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Happy hacking!</p>

            <p>
    Scott Adams, the creator of the famous comic strip <a href="https://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a>, states that there’s two main ways to become wealthy:
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Be the best in the world at one skill.
    
    </li><li>Be in the top 10% for a range of skills.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The first set includes people like Michael Phelps and Bill Gates. I’m going to make the likely assumption that you’re not part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The second set of people is much bigger. Scott Adams himself is part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best illustrator in the world, but he’s better than most. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best writer in the world, but he’s better than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the funniest person in the world, but he’s funnier than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    The magic happens when you combine those skills of his:

    </center>

    <p>
    Everyone has their own unique combination of skills. Scott Adams’ skill stack is going to be different than yours. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Being able to understand your own skill stack and be proactive about adding elements to it will help you make clear decisions on what opportunities to pursue. 
    </p>
    <h2>Learning to code</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    About 14 months ago, I graduated with a philosophy degree. I had pretty good writing skills and knew a bit about content marketing because of some side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    But what I really wanted to do was build things. I knew that if I could learn to code, I’d be able to leverage my other skills and pursue projects that unlocked new opportunities. For instance, at work, I’d be able to complete tasks that I couldn’t before. 
    </p>
    <p>
    So that’s what I set out to do. I enrolled in an online coding school and chopped away every single day:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/github_commits.png" width="614" height="121" alt="">
    </center>
    <p>
    I learned data analysis skills like SQL and picked up web development. At work, now, I can be much more productive and rather than relying on other people whenever I need to query something, I can do so myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of work, I can also hack on side projects that I didn’t have the ability to do before. This site is one of them (here’s another more <a href="https://www.ratemyroommate.io/">comical example</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>
    My technical skills, to be frank, are average. But when you combine them with my other skills like writing and marketing, I can pursue opportunities that I have a competitive advantage in. 
    </p>
    <h2>How To Choose Your Skills</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Nat Eliason has a <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/what-you-should-learn">great article</a> on this. Roughly speaking, you should identify what type of outcome you want and then work backwards to identify what skills you might need to get there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Let’s do this exercise for a couple of fields:
    </p>
    <h3>Example #1: Product Marketer to Product Manager</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst there’s definitely roles out there for non-technical PMs, your number one priority ought to be to level up on the technical side of things. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As a product manager, you’re likely going to be collaborating with engineers on a daily basis, so learning the fundamentals of programming will help you have more credibility when you speak with technical folks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing to mention here might be that as a product marketer, you’re used to coming into play <em>after</em> the product already exists. You’re creating content around its features and its use cases. As a PM, you’re in charge of building it from the ground up. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/from-marketing-to-product-management-3de21282c7ce">This article</a> has great recommendations on what type of skills you might need to learn.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:

    <h3>Example #2: Account Manager to Head of Account Management</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst the above was an example of a lateral career change, this is moreso to do with promotion. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As an Account Manager, you’re focusing on the day to day tasks of growing your accounts and keeping your clients happy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    From what I’ve observed, the Head of Account Management is going to have to play the role of quarterback. This requires the ability to vouch for the AMs who are reporting to you (along with knowing what motivates them), collaborating smartly with other departments, and being able to stay organized whilst your number of responsibilities steadily increase. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Rather than learning technical skills, such a change might require consuming books on leadership and taking courses on effective prioritization of tasks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/account_manager_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h3>Example #3: UX Designer to Freelancer</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Say you’ve worked for an agency as a UX Designer but now you’re ready to go out on your own. You have the chops needed to design beautiful experiences but now that you’re on your own, you need a way to find clients. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this case, you’re going to need to focus on building a brand, doing effective outreach, and learning techniques like upselling. <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher?lang=en">Jack Butcher</a> is a perfect example of this - he spent a decade honing his craft and then started his company Visualize Value. Now he makes $100k / month. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/ux_designer_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2>Carving out time</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Once you’ve identified what skills you want to learn, you need to be aggressive about finding the time to learn them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If you work a full time job, this can be hard to do. I’ve had success with waking up a couple of hours before work and putting in some <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/avoidcalendarcreep">deep work</a>. Alternatively, once you finish your work day, you can go exercise and then put in hours in the evening. I’ve found exercise to act as a great way to reset. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing you could do is talk directly with your employer and ask them to subsidize any courses you want to take. The key here would be to present a clear argument on why the course would help you at your job.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, one thing I’d stress is that even though the claim in this article is that you don’t need to be the best at a skill to reap its rewards, this doesn’t mean that this is some kind of magic pill to accelerate your career.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even getting moderately good at something takes time. Over the last year I’ve spent around 1000 hours learning to code, but I’ve just scratched the surface in terms of the level I want to be at. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Whenever I feel discouraged, I’m reminded of this video featuring computer science professor Randy Pausch:
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is a new Postgres-based, multithreaded, second-generation ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Inspired by Delayed::Job and Que, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is designed for maximum compatibility with Ruby on Rails, ActiveJob, and Postgres to be simple and performant for most workloads.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Designed for ActiveJob.</strong> Complete support for async, queues, delays, priorities, timeouts, and retries with near-zero configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Built for Rails.</strong> Fully adopts Ruby on Rails threading and code execution guidelines with Concurrent::Ruby.</li>
  <li><strong>Backed by Postgres.</strong> Relies upon Postgres integrity and session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once safety and stay within the limits of schema.rb.</li>
  <li><strong>For most workloads.</strong> Targets full-stack teams, economy-minded solo developers, and applications that enqueue less than 1-million jobs/day.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Visit Github for instructions on adding GoodJob to your Rails application</a> , or read on for the story behind GoodJob.</p>

<h3 id="a-second-generation-activejob-backend">A “Second-generation” ActiveJob backend</h3>

<p>Why “second-generation*”? GoodJob is designed from the beginning to be an ActiveJob-backend in a conventional Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>First-generation ActiveJob backends, like Delayed::Job and Que, all predate ActiveJob and support non-Rails applications. First-generation ActiveJob backends are significantly more complex than GoodJob because they separately maintain a lot of functionality that comes with a conventional Rails installation (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Concurrent::Ruby) and re-implement job lifecycle hooks so they can work apart from ActiveJob. I’ve observed that this can make them slow to keep up with major Rails changes. An impetus for GoodJob was reviewing the number of outages, blocked upgrades, and forks of first-generation backends I’ve managed during both major and minor Rails upgrades over the years.</p>

<p>As a second-generation ActiveJob backend, GoodJob can draft off of all the advances and solved problems of ActiveJob and Ruby on Rails. For example <code>rescue_from</code>, <code>retry_on</code>, <code>discard_on</code> are all implemented already by ActiveJob.</p>

<p>GoodJob is significantly thinner than first-generation backends, and over the long run hopefully easier to maintain and keep up with changes to Ruby on Rails. For example, GoodJob is currently ~600 lines of code, whereas Que is ~1,200 lines, and Delayed::Job is ~2,300 lines (2,000 for <code>delayed_job</code>, and an additional 300 for <code>delayed_job_active_record</code>).</p>

<p><em>*“Second generation” was coined for me by Daniel Lopez on <a href="https://rubyonrails-link.slack.com/archives/C0GB80GRE/p1594860261410500">Ruby on Rails Link Slack</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="postgres-based">Postgres-based</h3>

<p>I love Postgres. Postgres offers a lot of features, has safety and integrity guarantees, and simply running fewer services (skipping Redis) means less complexity in development and production.</p>

<p>GoodJob builds atop ActiveRecord. It’s numbingly boring, in a good way.</p>

<p>GoodJob uses session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once guarantees with relatively little performance implications for most workloads.</p>

<p>GoodJob’s session-level Advisory Lock implementation is perhaps the only “novel” aspect, that comes from my experience orchestrating complex web-driving of government systems (“the browser is the API”) for <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>. GoodJob uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find, lock, and return the next workable job in a single query. Session-level Advisory Locks will gracefully relinquish that lock if interrupted, without having to maintain a transaction for the duration of the job.</p>

<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>

<p>GoodJob uses <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">Concurrent::Ruby</a>  to scale and manage jobs across multiple threads. “<em>Concurrent Ruby makes one of the strongest thread-safety guarantees of any Ruby concurrency library”.</em>  Ruby on Rails has adopted Concurrent Ruby, and GoodJob follows its lead and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html">thread-execution and safety guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>In building GoodJob I leaned heavily on my positive experiences running Que, another multithreaded backend, on Heroku. Threads are great for balancing simplicity, economy, and performance for typical IO-bound workloads like heavy database queries, API requests, Selenium web-driving, or sending emails.</p>

<p>A feature that won’t be in GoodJob 1.0, but I hope to implement soon, is the ability to run the GoodJob scheduler inside the webserver process (“async mode”). This was a feature  <a href="https://github.com/que-rb/que/issues/238#issuecomment-480648845">withdrawn from Que</a> , but I believe can be safely implemented with Concurrent Ruby. An async mode would offer even greater economy, for example, in Heroku’s constrained environment.</p>

<h3 id="goodjob-is-right-for-me">GoodJob is right for me</h3>

<p>GoodJob’s design is based directly on my experience in 2-pizza, full-stack teams, and as an economy-minded solo developer. GoodJob already powers  <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com/">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href="https://brompt.com/">Brompt</a> performing tens-of-thousands of real-world jobs a day.</p>

<h3 id="is-goodjob-right-for-you">Is GoodJob right for you?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Try it out</a>  and let me know.</p>

For most of them, it was the first time they’d used a computer. They were astounded at what it could do. I was astounded at what they could do. </span></p><p id="viewer-2r4b2"><span>They only required a few hours to start writing programs of their own, learning things outside the curriculum, and showing me that 9-year-olds are capable of more than expected. </span></p><p id="viewer-6sj1d"><span>Schools are filled with children waiting to discover their talents and unleash their potential. The children in that robotics class have the potential to become engineers and mathematicians. Many of them will, because they were allowed to explore and develop those talents at an early age. For those children, that robotics program was life-changing. </span></p><p id="viewer-cknpi"><span>But what about the kid who doesn’t have the aptitude for programming but does have the aptitude for town planning? There isn’t a program for promising town planners. The town planner who misses out on discovering their passion isn’t alone. They’re part of the majority. </span></p><p id="viewer-3p9ds"><span>Most children leave school with a sense of relief. They leave without a sense of purpose or possibility, and without knowing what they’re truly good at. It’s not that these children lack ability, but rather that school only measures for one kind of ability. If you don't fit into that then school isn't for you. That shouldn’t sit well with you. </span></p><p id="viewer-217ub"><span><strong>WHY DOES EDUCATION LOOK LIKE IT DOES?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7b62r"><span>Our current system of teaching kids to sit in straight rows and obey instructions isn’t a coincidence — it was an investment in our economic future. Before the advent of public schooling, children worked in factories. </span></p><p id="viewer-am6k1"><span>Labour was in high demand. The best kind of labour was cheap, and nobody was cheaper than a 7-year-old kid. </span></p><p id="viewer-9th3q"><span>The idea of basic schooling for all children was met with outrage. Factory owners insisted that losing child workers would be catastrophic to their industries and fought to keep the kids at work.</span></p><p id="viewer-ale7v"><span>They were ultimately convinced that public schooling was a good idea because it would benefit the factories in the long run. A constant supply of obedient workers made for promising profit forecasts. The plan: trade short-term child-labour wages for longer-term productivity by giving kids a head start in doing what they’re told. </span></p><p id="viewer-eppge"><span>‘Go to school, sit in rows, listen to the teacher’ easily becomes ‘go to the factory, work at your station, listen to the foreman.’ </span></p><p id="viewer-1488k"><span>Large-scale education was not developed to motivate kids or to create lifelong learners. It wasn’t developed to help children discover their unique talents. It was developed to give children a head start on being obedient and efficient workers⁺. </span></p><p id="viewer-109q5"><span>Over a century has passed, and society has moved forward. The work we do, the tools we use, and the things we value have changed dramatically. The world of today would be barely recognisable to somebody living 100 years ago.</span></p><p id="viewer-dtm2q"><span>Unless you showed them the education system, because that hasn't changed much. </span></p><p id="viewer-ds6m4"><span><strong>EMBRACE THE INCONVENIENCE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fjati"><span>Education is a frequent topic of discussion. Everybody has an opinion and everybody has ideas for change. That shows two things: </span></p><ol><li id="viewer-ed7e3"><p><span>Enough people have been through the system and been disappointed by it to know that change is needed. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-2vq44"><p><span>Reform is discussed </span><span>ad nauseam, but we’re yet to see the progress we desire. </span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2ml7r"><span>Reform is making changes to improve something that already exists. How do you improve a system as broken as the current one? How do you eradicate the practice of creating obedient and compliant learners when it is so deeply ingrained in every part of the system?</span></p><p id="viewer-8rfs"><span>We don’t need reform.

                        <p><span>Sometimes it’s a good idea to let your brain cool off from the day-to-day work (which in my case is building the best translation management software in the world). What could be better than building and playing an arcade machine? </span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/long.gif" alt="" width="708" height="398"></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been enjoying arcades in 90s that’s why I’ve decided to put one together at home. There is quite a number of tutorials on the Internet on how to do that. However, the common problem is building the wooden cabinet – well, not a problem if you have a circular saw and some other professional tools available. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately (or luckily?), I don’t have a circular saw at home. So, here is my take on how to do it just using a pencil, a ruler, and a knife.</span></p>


<h2><span id="Preparations">Preparations</span></h2>
<p><span>I’m going to use the box that came with the monitor as a cabinet, which means the final arcade machine will be a portable bar top version. No soldering required.</span></p>
<p><span>The software part will run on <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>, an excellent image for Raspberry Pi micro computer. I will also explain how to add a nice cardboard-compatible theme, and fetch game video previews and info.</span></p>

<p>While RetroPie can <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/about/systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emulate 50 different gaming platforms</a> (including PlayStation, PSP, Dreamcast, Nintendo, MSX, and others), I will focus on setting up controllers and games for an emulator called <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Burn Alpha</a> (FBA) – basically a multiple retro arcade machine emulator. The FBA games typically use 2 to 4 controller buttons, sometimes 6 (works for us!). Otherwise, you can easily drop any other platform ROMs to the according folders, and they will just work (probably 😉 ).</p>



<p><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2.jpg 1280w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-300x225@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The total budget in my case was about €270, but it could be about €140 if you find a used monitor with a box (I just bought a brand new one).</p>

<p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">Download</a> the pre-built RetroPie image for the Raspberry Pi model you are using. You will also need a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/">Raspberry Pi Imager tool</a> to flash the image onto the SD card. Please note that not all card readers/writers are the same. Therefore, I advise reading tips and tricks on the Raspberry blog post if you run into issues writing the card.&nbsp; You need to burn a <strong>Custom</strong> <code>.img</code> from your computer:</p>

<p>Insert the SD card into the slot on Raspberry Pi and power it up! It will reboot itself after the initial preparations.</p>



<p>You will need to connect a USB keyboard at this point to do some initial set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once booted, you will see the following screen:</p>

									<p><em>This story is a part of a documentary series produced in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>NBC News</strong></a> by </em><a href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Outlaw Ocean Project</strong></a><em><u><strong>,</strong></u> a </em><em>non-profit journalism organization based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on human rights, labour and environmental crimes at sea.</em>
</p>
<p>For years, no one knew why dozens of battered wooden "ghost boats" were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-japan-ghost-boats-1.3344976" target="_blank"><strong>routinely washing ashore</strong></a> along the coast of Japan, often with the bodies of starved North Korean fishermen reduced to skeletons. 
</p>
<p>An investigation by the journalism organization <strong><a href="https://www.theoutlawocean.com/" target="_blank">The Outlaw Ocean Project</a> </strong>based on satellite data collected over the last two years has revealed, however, what marine researchers now say is the most likely explanation: China is sending an armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters, displacing smaller North Korean boats, forcing them farther out to rougher seas, and spearheading a decline in once-abundant squid stocks of more than 70 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The Chinese vessels — close to 800 last year — appear to be in violation of UN sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in North Korean waters in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The sanctions, imposed in 2017 in response to the country's nuclear tests, were intended to punish North Korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in exchange for valuable foreign currency. (Canada is one of the countries <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" target="_blank"><strong>helping to enforce</strong></a> those sanctions.)

									<p>The number of ships newly revealed in the investigation comprises roughly a third the size of the entire Chinese distant-water fishing fleet. The public and commercial satellite data was analyzed by Outlaw Ocean, Global Fishing Watch and researchers and academics from the U.S., South Korea and Japan. It was also peer-reviewed and published in the academic journal Science Advances.
</p>
<p>"This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation's waters," said Jaeyoon Park, a data scientist from <u><strong><a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" data-cke-saved-href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" target="_blank">Global Fishing Watch</a>,</strong></u> which tracks commercial fishing vessels around the world.</p>

									<p>Presented with the findings, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, "China has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the Security Council relating to North Korea." The ministry said China has "consistently punished" illegal fishing.
</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the North Korean government has authorized the Chinese ships. However, when South Korean Coast Guard authorities have boarded and inspected some of the ships as they traversed South Korean waters on their way to North Korean fishing grounds, the Chinese captains have presented fishing permits signed by North Korean authorities.</p>

																<h2>An elusive but expanding fleet</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>In March, two countries anonymously complained in <strong><a href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" data-cke-saved-href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" target="_blank">a report</a></strong> to the United Nations about China's violations of the sanctions and provided satellite imagery of Chinese ships fishing in North Korean waters and testimony from Chinese fishing crew who said they had alerted their government of their plans to fish in North Korean waters.
</p>
<p>Chinese officials dismissed this report, claiming the allegations were unfounded and involved scant few boats. 
</p>
<p>The recent revelations raise thorny questions about the consequences of China's ever-expanding role at sea and the lack of governance of the world's oceans. 
</p>
<p>Estimates of the total size of China's global fishing fleet vary widely. By some calculations, China has anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 fishing boats, accounting for nearly half of the world's fishing activity. The Chinese government says its distant-water fishing fleet, or those vessels that travel far from China's coast, is roughly 2,600 vessels, but other research, such as <strong><a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/16958-china-s-distant-water-fishing-fleet-scale-impact-and-governance" target="_blank">this study</a> </strong>by the U.K. think-tank ODI, puts the number closer to 17,000, with many of these ships operating undetected, in part by turning off the transponders that allow satellites to track them. 
</p>
<p>By comparison, the United States distant-water fishing fleet has fewer than 300 vessels.

									<p>China is not only the world's biggest seafood exporter. The country's population also accounts for more than a third of all fish consumption worldwide. Having depleted the seas close to home, the Chinese fishing fleet has been sailing farther afield in recent years to exploit the waters of other countries, including those in West Africa and Latin America, where enforcement tends to be weaker as local governments lack resources or inclination to police their waters. Most Chinese distant-water ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as local boats from Senegal or Mexico might catch in a year. </p>
<p>Many of the Chinese ships combing Latin American waters target forage fish, which is ground into fishmeal, a protein-rich pelletized supplement fed to aquaculture fish. The Chinese fleet has also focused on shrimp and the now endangered totoaba fish, which is much prized in Asia for the alleged medicinal properties of its bladder and can sell for between $1,400 and $4,000 per fish. 
</p>
<p>Nowhere at sea is China more dominant than in squid fishing, as the country's fleet accounts for 50 to 70 per cent of the squid caught in international waters, effectively controlling the global supply of the popular seafood. Half of the squid pulled from the high seas by Chinese fishermen is exported to Europe, north Asia and the U.S. 
</p>
<p>To catch squid, the Chinese typically use trawling nets stretched between two vessels, a practice criticized by marine conservationists because it results in a lot of fish inadvertently and wastefully killed. Critics also accuse China of keeping high-quality squid for domestic consumption, exporting lower-quality products at higher prices, overwhelming vessels from other countries in major squid breeding grounds, and influencing international negotiations about conservation and distribution of global squid resources for its own interest.

																<h2>Subsidizing squid</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>China's global fishing fleet did not grow into a modern behemoth on its own. The government has robustly subsidized the industry, spending billions of yuan annually. Chinese boats can travel so far partly because of a tenfold increase in diesel fuel subsidies between 2006 and 2011, after which Beijing stopped releasing statistics, according to a Greenpeace study. </p>
<p>For over a decade, the Chinese government has helped pay to construct bigger, more advanced steel-hulled trawlers, even sending medical ships to fishing grounds to enable the fleet to stay at sea longer. The Chinese government supports the squid fleet in particular by providing it with an informational forecast of where to find the most lucrative squid stocks, using data gleaned from satellites and research vessels.
</p>
<p>On its own, distant-water squid fishing is a money-losing business, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" data-cke-saved-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" target="_blank"><strong>research</strong></a> by Enric Sala, founder and leader of the U.S. National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project. The sale price of squid typically does not come close to covering the cost of the fuel required to catch the fish, Sala found.
</p>
<p>Still, China is hardly the worst offender when it comes to such subsidies, which ocean conservationists say, through over-capacity and illegal fishing, are a major reason that the oceans are rapidly running out of …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/world-internet-320.jpg" alt="World Internet" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I have always heard that Internet Service Providers in the 
      United States charge more for their services than ISP's in most 
      of the rest of the world.  Since I was curious about the 
      veracity of that claim, I decided to do some research of my own 
      this week.</p>

   <p>The table below gives the results I obtained from a random sampling of 
      Internet service providers around the world.  I simply went onto the 
      Internet and found what I could find with the aid of Google 
      translate.  Getting a more accurate view of things would have taken 
      weeks of research, which was more time than I was prepared to 
      dedicate to this project.  However, I think the data that I have 
      gathered does give a sense of whether US ISP's price their services 
      significantly higher that the norm around the world.</p>

   <p>By the way, I am aware that prices of goods and services in countries 
      tend to track wages, and 
      <a href="https://www.rbth.com/science-and-tech/328998-why-internet-cheap-in-russia">Internet 
      services are no exception</a>.  Were I to do a more "scientific" 
      investigation, I would obtain more data points and normalized the 
      prices I find to the average wages in each country.  One thing I can 
      say is that wages of most developed countries are within about a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">factor 
      of three</a> of each other, and the United States is in the middle of 
      that range.  So, even without normalization, if we compare US prices 
      to those of other developed countries, we should have some idea of 
      whether US prices are much less affordable for consumers.</p>

   </tbody></table>
   <p>I should make a few clarifications.  First, the websites of ISP's 
      often leave out important information--like upload speeds, numbers of 
      months of commitment required with Internet service plans, and types 
      of data transmission line technology.  When I could not find 
      information on the websites of ISP's, I did not include it in the 
      table.  My assumption is that IPS's do not advertise poor upload 
      speeds, so if upload speeds are not posted on their websites, we can 
      safely assume they are low.</p>

   <p>Next, the "Price per Month" column in the table contains the price 
      after any initial promotional prices have ended.  So, this is what 
      most customers should be paying for their Internet service.</p>

   <p>The only types of Internet service plans shown in the table are DSL 
      and fiber optic cable plans.  (UPDATE: I assume that cable TV
      transmission lines were used in some of the plans for which the 
      Website advertisements did not specify their transmission line 
      technology.  I did not specifically intend to exclude those plans 
      from consideration.)  Since cheapskatesguide.org is about 
      finding the best deals, I excluded from consideration categories of 
      Internet services that I feel are not good deals.  Plans with large 
      data caps are the best bargains for most customers in terms of bytes 
      received per dollar paid.  As a result, I only looked at Internet 
      service plans with data caps that are similar to the one-terabyte-cap 
      plans that we have in the United States.  For the same reason, I did 
      not include any cell phone Internet service plans in the table.  I did 
      not include satellite Internet providers in the table either, because 
      satellite Internet service is generally more expensive.  Although 
      dial-up Internet service is very cheap and still being offered by a 
      few companies, I did not include any of them in the table.  Dial-up 
      service is just too slow for surfing the Internet these days.  
      However, if you still have a land-line telephone connection and a 
      modem, are heavily into email and text-only websites, and don't do 
      much else, you may want to look into dial-up services.</p>

   <p>Many plans had details associated with them that I did not show in 
      the table.  Some included things like phone service and TV.  I mostly 
      did not mention those details, because customers cannot get Internet 
      services from the listed companies without those extras.  Also, some 
      ISP's have additional constraints that I did not mention.  For 
      example, Maisha Broadband in Tanzania has higher bandwidths at night 
      than during the day.  I reported the daytime speeds and ignored the 
      nighttime speeds.  Another example is that Virgin Connect in Russia 
      charges much higher rates to single family homes than to apartments.  
      Your guess is a good as mine about why that is.  I simply reported 
      the monthly rates for apartment dwellers.  I also ignored installation 
      fees, since I believe most customers keep the same service for many 
      years.  So, the added cost of installation fees is usually 
      negligible.  Many ISP's have four or five tiers of service.  In those 
      cases, I chose to report only the plans from each provider with the 
      the slowest connection speed, the fastest, and an intermediate 
      speed.</p>

   <p>I had great difficulty getting information on African ISP's.  Most of 
      their websites were unreachable.  Most of those that were online did 
      not offer wired internet connections.  Most only offered some kind of 
      wireless or satellite connection.</p>

   <p>I want to remind readers that the prices in the table are the ISP's 
      <i>advertised prices</i> during the middle of July of 2020.  If you 
      have had experiences like mine, you will likely understand that you 
      may not be offered a plan with the advertised speeds and prices.  
      For example, one of the two ISP's that serve my small city in the 
      United States, and the one I happen to use, advertises plans with the 
      following download speeds on their national website: 10, 18, 25, 50, 
      and 100 Mbits/s.  I called my ISP last week to ask about their fastest 
      service in my city and was told that it is 10 Mbits/s.  I was also 
      told that the price was $10 above their advertised price after taking 
      into account taxes and equipment fees.</p>

   <p>How does my ISP get away with providing nothing faster than their 
      slowest advertised connection, and over charging for it at that?  I 
      live in a city that contains a significant population of 
      professionals, including a large percentage of engineers.  So you 
      would think that we would demand better.  Most likely thanks to a deal 
      that our city has made with the local Internet service providers, the 
      only alternative ISP in my city is the cable TV provider.  When I 
      tried to contact them, I found that no phone number was listed 
      anywhere on their website.  I eventually found their phone number 
      through other means and contacted them.  After a 10 minute hold, their 
      representative gave me the information I needed.  They have comparable 
      prices to those advertised by my ISP, and they have plans available 
      in my area with higher speeds.  Unfortunately, many customer reviews 
      say their service is unreliable.  So, given a choice between an 
      organization that has unsatisfactory customer service and reliability 
      and one that in my opinion has good customer service but slow 
      Internet speed, I choose the later.  My guess is that this is what we 
      must live with when our local governments decide to sell us out by 
      allowing monopoly or duopoly ISP's to operate in cities all across 
      the United States.</p>

   <p>Companies that provide Internet Services also engage in some 
      distasteful practices.  Generally, not only do prices of Internet 
      services differ from the advertised prices, but they differ according 
      to who you speak to at a particular company.  Yes, you understood what 
      I meant to say.  You will often find that when you call company X and 
      ask the price of their plan Y, you will be told one price, and when </p></div></div>

				<p>Our backend system is built on <strong>AWS</strong>. Today I’m going to tell you how we had cut costs three times for the servers by using spot instances on the production environment. I’ll also walk you through configuring auto scaling. Firstly, you will see the overview of how it works and then we provide the instruction to launch it.</p><h2 id="what-are-spot-instances">What are spot instances?</h2><blockquote>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot instances</a> are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at steep discounts. &nbsp;Amazon says they can reach 90%, in our experience, it is ~3x, varies depending on the region, AZ or instance type. Their main difference from the regular ones is that they can be shut down at any time.</blockquote><p>That’s why for a long time we thought it was okay to use them for DEV environments, or for calculating tasks with saving the intermediate result to S3 or database but not for PROD. There are third-party solutions that allow using spots for PROD, but we didn’t implement it due to numerous kludges to our case. The approach described in the article fully works within standard AWS capabilities, without additional scripts, crons, etc.</p><p>Next, I’m going to provide some screenshots which show spot instances pricing history.</p><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region (Ireland). The price is predominantly stable within three months, cost-savings now are <strong>2.9x</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

The price is constantly changing within three months, cost-savings now are from <strong>2.3x to 2.8x</strong> depending on availability zone.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>t3.small</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

It sends requests to <em>EC2 Target Group</em> (TG). TG is responsible for opening ports on the instances for ALB and connecting them to the container ports of <em>Elastic Container Service</em> (ECS). ECS is an analog of <em>Kubernetes</em> in AWS, which manages <em>Docker</em> containers.</p><p>One instance can have multiple functioning containers with the same ports that’s why we cannot assign them fixed. ECS reports to TG that it launches a new task (in Kubernetes terminology it is called <em>“Pod”</em>). It checks free ports on the instance and assigns one of them for the new launching task. Also, TG regularly checks if the instance and API are functioning with a health check. If it sees any problem, it stops sending requests there.</p><h4 id="ec2-auto-scaling-groups-ecs-capacity-providers-">EC2 Auto Scaling Groups + ECS Capacity Providers.</h4><p>In the diagram above, the <em>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups</em> (ASG) service is not indicated. We can learn from the title that it is in charge of auto scaling. However, AWS didn’t have built-in capability to manage the number of running machines from ECS until recently. ECS allowed scaling the number of tasks, for example, based on CPU or RAM usage or the number of requests. But if the tasks took all the available instances, new machines were not launched automatically.</p><p>This changed with <em>ECS Capacity Providers</em> (ECS CP). Every service in ECS can now be linked with ASG. And, if the tasks don’t have enough running instances, more instances will be started (but within the established limits of ASG). It works the other way around as well. If ECS CP sees standing idle instances, without tasks, it will command ASG to shut them down. ECS CP can indicate the target capacity percent of instancesso that a certain number of machines would always be available for rapid task scaling. We’ll talk about it later.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-templates-">EC2 Launch Templates.</h4><p>Before describing the creation of the infrastructure, the last service I’m going to talk about is <em>EC2 Launch Templates</em>. It allows creating a template to launch all the machines to avoid repeating it every time from scratch. Here you can choose the type of the launching machine, security group, disk image, and lots of other parameters. It’s possible to indicate user data as well that will be uploaded to all the running instances. You can run scripts in the user data, for example, you can edit the content of<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS agent configuration file</a>.</p><p>One of the most important configuration parameters in this article is<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html"> ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING</a>=true. If this parameter is <em>turned on</em>, then as soon as ECS receives a signal that the spot instance is being taken, it switches all its running tasks into <strong>Draining</strong> status. <em>No new tasks</em> will be assigned for this instance. If there are any tasks that are <strong>Pending</strong> on this instance, ECS cancels them. It no longer receives the requests from the balancer as well. You get the notification about deleting the instance two minutes before it happens. In this regard, if your service doesn’t execute the task for more than two minutes and doesn’t save anything to the disk, you can use spot instances without losing any data.</p><p>Talking about the disk, AWS has recently<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-ecs-aws-fargate-support-amazon-efs-filesystems-generally-available/#:~:text=To%20use%20EFS%20with%20ECS,or%20TLS%20encryption%20in%20transit."> made</a> it possible to use <em>Elastic File System</em> (EFS) with ECS. Even using the disk with this approach is not an obstacle, but we haven’t tested it, because we don’t need the disk to store the status. After receiving <strong>SIGINT</strong> by default (it is sent in the moment of task switch into <strong>Draining</strong> status) all the running tasks will be stopped in 30 sec, even if they haven’t completed. You can change this time with<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT</a> parameter. The main rule is not to set it for more than 2 minutes for spot machines.</p><h2 id="-reating-a-service-">Сreating a service.</h2><p>Let’s proceed directly to create the described service. I’ll describe some useful features that were not mentioned above.</p><p>Generally, it’s a step-by-step instruction, but I won’t mention any basic or more specific cases. All the operations are made in <em>AWS Management Console</em>, but you can achieve the same results with <em>CloudFormation</em> or <em>Terraform</em>. We use Terraform in Adapty.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-template-">EC2 Launch Template.</h4><p>With this service, you can create a configuration of machines. You can manage the templates in <em>EC2</em> → <em>Instances</em> → <em>Launch templates</em>.</p><p>Amazon machine image (AMI). Specify the disk image which will be used by instances. For ECS, in most cases, it’s better to use an optimized image from Amazon. It is regularly updated and contains everything necessary for ECS functioning. To find out the relevant image ID, go to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html"> Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs</a> page, choose the region, and copy AMI ID for it. For example, for us-east-1 region, relevant image ID at the time of this writing — <em>ami-00c7c1cf5bdc913ed</em>. You need to paste this ID to <strong>Specify a custom value</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Instance type.</strong> Specify an instance type. Choose the one that is best suited for your task.</p><p><strong>Key pair (login).</strong> Specify the certificate for SSH connection.</p><p><strong>Network settings.</strong> Specify network settings. The <strong>networking platform</strong> in most cases should be Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). <strong>Security groups</strong> serve to protect your instances. Since we’re going to use the balancer in front of the instances, I would recommend specifying the group which allows inbound connection only from the balancer. That means you will have two security groups: one for the balancer which allows inbound connections from anywhere via <em>80 (http)</em> and <em>443 (https)</em> ports, and the other one for the machines which allows inbound connections via any port from the balancer group. We have to open outbound connections in both the groups via <em>TCP protocol</em> to all the ports for all the addresses. We can limit the ports and addresses for the outbound connections, but in that case, &nbsp;it is necessary to constantly monitor that you’re not trying to address anywhere via the closed port.</p><p><strong><strong>Storage (volumes). </strong></strong>Specify the disk parameters for the machines. Disk capacity can’t be less than the one specified in AMI, for ECS Optimized, it is 30 GiB.</p><p><strong>Advanced details.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Purchasing option.</strong> </strong>It asks whether we want to buy spot instances. We do but <u>don’t mark</u> the checkbox here. We’ll configure it in <em>Auto Scaling Group</em>, it has more options there.</p><p><strong>IAM instance profile.</strong> Specify the role for the the instances. The instances need access rights to operate within ECS. The access rights are usually defined in <em>ecsInstanceRole</em>. In some cases, the role is existing in your AWS account. If not then here is the<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html"> instruction</a> on how to do it. After its creation, specify it in the template.</p><p>Next, there are a lot of parameters, basically, you can leave the default, but each of them has a comprehensible description. I always turn on <em>EBS-optimized instance</em> and <em>T2/T3 Unlimited</em> parameters, if we use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html"> burstable</a> instances.</p><p><strong>User data.</strong> Specify user data. We will edit the file <em>/etc/ecs/ecs.config</em> which stores the ECS agent configuration.</p><p>Here is the example of how user data may look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={\"registry.gitlab.com\":{\"username\":\"username\",\"password\":\"password\"}}" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd</strong> — this parameter indicates that the instance belongs to a cluster with the given name which means this cluster will be able to place their tasks on this server. We still haven’t created a cluster, but we will use this name when creating it.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true</strong> — the parameter points that after receiving a spot instance turn off signal, all the tasks must be switched to Draining status.</p><p><strong>ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m</strong> — the parameter indicates that after receiving the SIGINT signal, all the tasks have one minute before being killed.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker</strong> — the parameter indicates that we use a docker-scheme as an authentication format.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA=...</strong> — these are the parameters of the connection to a private container registry, where all your Docker images are stored. If they are public there is no need to specify anything else.</p><p>In this article I will use a public image from <em>Docker Hub</em>, there is no need to indicate <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH…</strong></p></section></div>

			<p><span>W</span>ith <i>Hamilton</i> on my mind, I had a fanciful thought while reading the new book <i>Love Drugs: The Chemical Future of Relationships</i>. The Founding Father, stressed and tired and focused on getting his bill for a national bank through Congress, could have saved himself a lot of grief if, in his moment of weakness with the temptress Maria Reynolds, he’d had an anti-love drug to cool his loins. Instead his response to her feminine wiles, as conjured by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is to pray, “Lord, show me how to say no to this.” It didn’t prove effective.</p> <p>Love drugs harken back to fairytale fantasies about potions and spells, but the notion isn’t purely fiction. The authors of <i>Love Drugs</i>—Julian Savulescu, an Oxford philosopher, and Brian Earp, a Yale doctoral candidate in philosophy and psychology—make plain that our brain’s love, lust, and attachment systems can be affected by real-life neuro-technologies. With cogent arguments, vivid experimental detail, and engaging storytelling, the authors show that chemical interventions to foster, enhance, and diminish love will only become more sophisticated as scientists discern the biochemical nature of the romantic bond.</p> <p>Aficionados of Aldous Huxley’s <i>The Doors of Perception</i> and <i>Brave New World</i> will find <i>Love Drugs</i> both entertaining and sobering. In fact, <i>Love Drugs</i> was almost titled <i>Brave New Love</i>. “There is a part of me that still prefers <i>Brave New Love</i>,” Earp says. “I think a lot of people think this is a pro-love drugs book. We tried not to do that. This is not ‘science will fix all of our problems.’ A title like <i>Brave New Love</i> says, ‘There’s a real danger here.’ Maybe if I could wave a magic wand I’d go back to <i>Brave New Love</i>. But it is what it is.”</p> <p>I was excited to speak to Earp, a research fellow in the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford. I first learned of him in 2011 from YouTube. At the time, Earp was getting his master’s degree in psychology at Oxford, which was where philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris happened to be giving a talk on his then-new book <i>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</i>. Earp, skeptical of the ostensible novelty of his thesis, incisively asked him to defend it. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuuTOpZxwRk" target="_blank">recording of the exchange</a> has almost 2 million views. In our conversation, Earp didn’t disappoint. He was as thoughtful and careful and smart in his responses to me as I expected him to be.</p><figure data-alt="Gallagher_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17447_cc0c490aab832307f9cd2ebad8fa114e.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Higher Love:</strong> Brian Earp (above) says his intellectual foray into romantic relationships, with Love Drugs, is consistent with the wider transhumanist tradition of considering how we can “use new technologies to intervene in our biology to help us meet our higher goals.”</span><span>Rob Judges</span></figcaption></figure> <p><b>What are the possible effects of drugs on love?</b></p> <p>One possibility is that people will begin to see that love is something that is at least partly in our command. Many believe the opposite is the case, that love is a mysterious thing that just happens to you if you meet the right person. You might fall into and potentially fall out of love, but there’s not much you can really do about it. There’s something about this view that is potentially immature, in that it may prevent us from exercising our agency to try to work on the love that we share with someone to whom we’re committed. We’re never going to have a magic potion, like in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, that just causes you to feel a certain kind of love for somebody. But we can nudge the probability that we’ll have a certain kind of loving relationship with someone, or they will be able to enhance certain aspects of that loving relationship.</p> <p><b>What biological chemicals underpin love?</b></p> <p>The attachment system is underwritten by oxytocin and vasopressin, and some other neurochemicals. Lots of things go into libido. One of them is testosterone, and testosterone levels can be manipulated. Similarly, serotonin is involved in attraction. People have noticed that there are similarities in certain aspects of feeling in the early stages of attraction to somebody and in obsessive compulsive disorder. Both of these things seem to turn on serotonin levels.</p> <p><b>How do you tweak these biological systems?</b></p> <p>You can’t tweak these things like independent knobs. Instead we have these really big blunt-style effects that operate across multiple systems. If you depress libido with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for example, you can lose interest in being physically intimate with your partner. That means you’re not going to be releasing oxytocin as you would naturally. That has potential to degrade your attachment bond over time. You can start to have a looping effect. On the other hand, if you’re riddled with depression, and you’re among the subset of people for whom SSRIs are helpful in treating the symptoms of depression, maybe you’re lucky that the SSRI doesn’t diminish your libido. In that case, one and the same drug could potentially be a relationship helper.</p><blockquote><p>Psilocybin seems to temporarily wash out prior relationship assumptions so that you are seeing anew.</p> </blockquote><p><b>You write about the potential benefits of psychoactive drugs. How can they affect our love systems?</b><br></p> <p>The psychedelics and MDMA, or ecstasy, are more global drugs. You wouldn’t use them for a precise intervention on a subroutine of your neurochemistry. Rather they have a global effect in altering our disposition toward our partner and our emotions, where we can engage meaningfully with the content of our relationship. MDMA can cause feelings of warmth and closeness, at least under the influence of the drug. But it can also cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about. People in recent trials say they feel more loving toward those around them, more interested in taking things from other people’s perspective, and more mentally flexible, so that if somebody says something that might have hurt their feelings before, they don’t immediately take it in just that one way.</p> <p><b>What’s going on in our brains that might explain how psychedelics can help our love lives?</b></p> <p>Our view is the brain is a big Bayesian prediction mechanism. We try to predict what’s going on in the world as efficiently as possible. Once we notice certain patterns or regularities, we just store that as an expectation. Then we continue to interpret the world in light of those prior beliefs. But some of these prior beliefs can just be ruts that we get stuck in. I’ve had a certain number of arguments with my partner, and I just start to interpret everything that they say in light of my prior conclusions about what was going on, rather than being able to hear them in a new way. I just can’t be bothered or I’m too defensive or whatever it is. What psilocybin seems to do is temporarily wash out some of these prior assumptions so that you are seeing anew, you’re taking in information without prejudging it as much as you might have in the past. So for people who are stuck in a rut, who can’t seem to talk their way out of a rut, having a drug that directly suppresses these problematic priors and allows you to look at the world with fresh eyes could be really helpful.</p><div>

</div> <p><b>What’s the danger of love drugs?</b></p> <p>It seems like love drugs are ripe for abuse. They’re not a panacea. They’re not something that just everybody should try. They have to be used under particular circumstances, where people have been properly screened. And we have to keep developing the evidence for when, and under what conditions, they’ll be helpful rather than harmful. It’s easy to get carried away because some of these drugs, the psychedelics, are very powerful. Many people who try them feel transformed by them. We need to decide what we want our future to look like. We haven’t even taken care to properly study the interpersonal effects of medications we already use. That’s a risk that is unfolding under our very noses. For the most part, we’re just stumbling along without thinking carefully about the ethical and the normative implications of using love drugs.</p> <p><b>What does a drug-assisted therapy session look like?</b></p> <p>There’s a small pilot study happening where some of the researchers who are involved in psilocybin for PTSD trials are bringing in the PTSD sufferer’s partner, and both of them are undergoing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. A couple first has multiple interactions with a therapist to establish the therapeutic relationship. They’ll talk about what they hope to get out of the experience. They’ll be counseled on the effects these drugs can have. Part of the effect of the drug is how you relate to what’s going on when you’re in an altered state of consciousness in a therapeutic context. Then, separately, each one will be made comfortable, probably given eyeshades and some headphones, and they’ll take a dose of the drug. With the therapist there to help respond to any concerns that may arise, the couple will reflect on their own emotions. They will talk with the therapist and then with each other, when they’re ready, about how they’re going to implement whatever lessons they feel they’ve learned as the effects of the drug are wearing off. In some cases, people report that six months or a year after their sessions they still feel more mentally flexible and more able to deal with conflict in a productive manner.</p><blockquote><p>MDMA can cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about.</p> </blockquote><p><b>If someone says that using love drugs is an easy solution that avoids the tough work of a loving relationship, how do you respond?</b><br></p> <p>One reason why people have that worry is they think that if something feels like a quick fix, it simply won’t work or won’t be effective over the long run. Or it will be a replacement …</p></div></div>

If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<p>After playing around with the new tool from OpenAI, named GPT-3, it’s clear that we’ve probably reached an inflection point in the progress of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; To think of it in more commonplace terms, parents will often have the interesting experience of watching their children suddenly gain competency in a skill, seemingly overnight.&nbsp; There will be lots of struggle and failed starts and then as if all in one moment, boom, suddenly the kid can do something new.&nbsp; GPT-3 hails a moment when machine learning got turned on and suddenly it could do an amazing new trick, and it does this new trick with astonishing coherence and ability.&nbsp; The hope of this episode is to present a description of what GPT-3 is in layman’s terms and then explore some possible ways that this could be used, and how it might impact society.</p>


<p>But first, what is GPT?&nbsp; The acronym stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.&nbsp; Ok sure, but what exactly is it?&nbsp; How do we interact with it?&nbsp; In simple terms <em>it’s a program that accepts some text and then generates a continuation of this text.</em>&nbsp; What exactly does this look like?&nbsp; For those with access to the GPT-3 playground through OpenAI, it just looks like an empty textbox with a submit button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters a principle that has emerged during the last week as developers have played around with it:</p>

<p><em>Garbage in, Garbage out.</em></p>

<p>GPT-3 mimics the style, tone and character of whatever text you feed it.&nbsp; (For those curious, you can hit the submit button with an empty textbox and GPT-3 will generate something.&nbsp; The first time I did this it started talking in French about libraries.&nbsp; The second time it started talking about heatwaves being in the headlines.)&nbsp; There is a bit of an art to the prompt you give GPT-3.&nbsp; Again, garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<p>Here are two examples:</p>


<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation: <em>A confused voice came from inside. When I opened the door, the person that looked back at me was Hayama Hayato. Why was Hayama, who I only shared memories of me playing soccer with, in my room at this hour of the night? That question immediately flew out from my mouth.</em></p>


<p>Second example, same exact input:</p>

<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation:&nbsp; <em>they respond 'Super' – at least they were back in the days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. I love the little sixties touches too, the poodle skirts, the VWs, the hippydom.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The input of “what’s up?” doesn’t provide any context, so GPT-3 generates text in a random direction each time. But notice how coherent it was…</p>

<p>But if you provide GPT-3 with context, say, the first couple paragraphs of an episode from Tinkered Thinking and it will generate a continuation of that episode which is shockingly on point and very believable.&nbsp; Episode <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=836">823</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">824</a> are non-fiction episodes that explore just this idea.&nbsp; About half of each episode was <em>generated</em> by GPT-3.&nbsp; This collaboration was also done for <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">Episode 826</a> which is a fictional short story.&nbsp; GPT-3’s contribution to that episode is not explicitly indicated but there too it wrote approximately half of the text, and that episode in particular demonstrates an aspect of context in relationship to GPT-3.&nbsp; The program’s initial contributions to the fictional short story are a bit clunky.&nbsp; But as the story goes on, GPT-3’s contributions get <em>better and better </em>as the entire context of the story grows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious at this point that if you were to do something nefarious like input some dangerous ideas into GPT-3, then it would continue in the same vein.&nbsp; This is an important point that lends to obvious criticism and it’s a topic of which OpenAI is extremely conscious.&nbsp; The use of GPT-3 in the wild requires a security application among other safeguards to limit GPT-3’s use in obviously negative ways.&nbsp; Again, the principle holds: <em>garbage in, garbage out.&nbsp; </em>That holds not just for level of composition but of course, also subject matter.</p>

<p>Now how exactly does this magic work?&nbsp; To answer this, it’s necessary to wrap one’s mind around machine learning.&nbsp; How exactly does a machine learn?&nbsp; To be honest, nobody really knows.&nbsp; In a way, we’ve created a black box that can learn to figure things out.&nbsp; To really answer the question: how exactly does a machine learn is similar to asking: how does a person arise from all the chatter between neurons in a person’s brain?&nbsp; No one can answer that question.&nbsp; And likewise, no one can really answer the question about what’s really going on when a neural net is being trained in a machine learning context.&nbsp; That being said, we can describe some aspects of the process that help us grasp a sense of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Turns out, Machine Learning doesn’t seem too much different than human learning, though the differences are enormous and enormously important.&nbsp; Our brains are vast networks of neurons and they all talk to each other and somehow from all that chatter, we as individuals, emerge.&nbsp; To be sure, our understanding of the brain is still rudimentary, but it’s clear that neurons ‘listen’ to the chatter around them via a web of arms or dendrites that reach out to other neurons, and based on the signals they hear, they fire their own signal to be heard by another neuron or set of neurons.&nbsp; Multiply that process roughly 86 billion times, give it the right shape, and some configuration and boom, you have a human brain that will try to figure things out.&nbsp; (To dive a little deeper it’s useful to know that an infant actually has around 100 billion neurons, and as we learn how to exist in the world, we pare down this number significantly.)</p>

<p>GPT-3 was trained to generate text using a computational model that bares a lot of similarity to our jumble of neurons we call a brain.&nbsp; The analogy is so close in fact that this computational model is referred to as a ‘neural net’.&nbsp; Now here’s an interesting fact about GPT-3:&nbsp; the neural net upon which it was trained contains 175 billion parameters, or what you might think of as neurons.&nbsp; But there’s a distinction here we need to be very careful about.&nbsp; The node, or neuron, or what’s often referred to as a ‘parameter’ within this neural net is not a neuron in the same way that our neurons are.&nbsp; There is a similarity, but our neurons are vastly more complex than the nodes that exist within a neural net.&nbsp; Within the context of machine learning, a neuron is a fairly simple weighted value.&nbsp; These values dictate how one node talks to another.&nbsp; An actual human neuron is far more complex regarding how it listens and signals it’s neighbors.&nbsp; We must also take into account that there are many different types of neurons in the human brain specializing in different ways with different functions.&nbsp; Human neurons also have varying numbers of dendrites which are used to listen to other neurons.&nbsp; A single neuron can have over 100 dendrites and each dendrite has characteristics that determine how and what the core neuron hears and ultimately what sort of signal it sends.&nbsp; This presents a level of complexity that far exceeds what is going on with the nodes or neurons in a machine learning context.&nbsp; And this difference in complexity should make it intuitive why GPT-3 was trained using so many ‘neurons’.&nbsp; It’s construction and organization of these ‘neurons’ is far simpler and more straightforward than what we have going on between our ears, so where the neural net lacks in terms of shape and initial configuration, it attempts to make up for in size and the brute force achieved by speed and computational iteration.</p>

<p>So how does a neural net learn in order for something like GPT-3 to work?&nbsp; First you need a gargantuan amount of data.&nbsp; GPT-3 was trained using text from the internet - an amount of text that is just inconceivable for a single human being to think about reading.&nbsp; Think of every comment, every post, every description, every pdf book freely available, all the tweets and blogs, manuals, dissertations, threads, rantings - all of it.&nbsp; That was the block of text that was given to the neural net for it’s training. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does that training work?&nbsp; Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and asked you to guess what that word is.&nbsp; As a human, you’d probably do really well at this.&nbsp; You’d certainly do a perfect job guessing a <em>sensible</em> word that fits the context and which works, regardless of whether you guess the actual word. Here’s a tiny example:&nbsp; Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this ___________ . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The above example is easy.&nbsp; The word is ‘sentence’.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Since I’ve started a new paragraph, you could also plop the word ‘paragraph’ into the slot and it still works.&nbsp; This is the task that GPT-3 has become remarkably good at:&nbsp; <em>what word would make sense to come next?&nbsp; </em>The training of the neural net essentially asked this question of itself over and over.&nbsp; We can imagine the neural net reading 99 words and guessing what the 100th word would be.&nbsp; It would then check the answer and see how far ‘off’ the answer was, and based on the difference it would backtrack through the neural net to find all of the nodes that were most responsible for the choice of the wrong word, and then it would adjust the weights of those nodes, which in turn effects how those nodes will talk to one another in the next round.&nbsp; Run this game an astronomical number of times with an inconceivably large amount of text and after a while the neural net gets pretty good at the game it’s playing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the computer is not actually ‘reading’ the text that’s given to it.&nbsp; The computer first creates embeddings for this block of text.&nbsp; What is an embedding?&nbsp; It’s arbitrary, but it’s a form that the computer can actually work with.&nbsp; Computers function using binary code.&nbsp; Each letter that you read on a website is actually derived from a binary code.&nbsp; So embeddings are bits of binary code that are associated with the words and word-snippets that the computer ‘reads’.&nbsp; These embeddings …</p></div></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was browsing <a href="https://whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a> when I noticed a request to <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js">https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js</a>[1].  After beautifying the code, I found the string “Distil” in the code many times.  “Distil” refers to Distil Networks, one of the leading bot detection vendors until its acquisition by Imperva in 2019.  Whitepages seems to use them for their anti-scraping abilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>The first part of the code is the fingerprinting module.  This code is not really obfuscated, just minified (unlike the headless detection code later).  It collects a bunch of information from the browser using (mostly) standard techniques.  <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-evolution-of-hi-def-fingerprinting-in-bot-mitigation/">According to Imperva</a>, their “Hi-def” fingerprints encompass over 200 device attributes and have a 0% false positive rate.  The fingerprinting code appears to be based off Valve’s <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs2/blob/master/fingerprint2.js">fingerprintjs2</a> (identical function names and contents in many cases), albeit with some additions.</p>

<p>This code collects (via JavaScript):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Browser User-Agent - navigator.userAgent
* Browser language - navigator.language
* System language (IE only) - navigator.systemLanguage
* User language (IE only) - navigator.userLanguage
* Screen resolution - screen.width/screen.height
* Timezone offset in hours - (new Date).getTimezoneOffset() / -60
* IndexedDB support - !!window.indexedDB
* HTMLElement addBehavior support (IE only) - !!document.body.addBehavior
* WebSQL support - !!window.openDatabase
* CPU Class (IE and Firefox only) - navigator.cpuClass || navigator.oscpu
* Browser platform - navigator.platform
* Do Not Track support - navigator.doNotTrack
* Browser plugins (non IE) - navigator.plugins enumeration
* ActiveX plugins (IE only) - trying/catching creating ActiveXObjects with names from a list of popular plugins
* Canvas fingerprinting - standard method.  Creating a Canvas element, drawing some rectangles and arcs on it, along with the string "Cwm fjordbank glyphs vext quiz,", then getting the base64 PNG representation via toDataURL and hashing it
* Font detection - using a method popularized by [Lalit Patel](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/szepeviktor/d28dfcfc889fe61763f3/raw/6bbcda9766e65fd81e951400e0ceca03c14b6fad/fontdetect.js).  Essentially, they measure the dimensions of the browsers default (fallback) monospace, sans-serif, and serif fonts.  They then measure the dimensions of a large list of fonts.  If there is a difference in dimensions between a font in the list and the fallback font, the font is installed.
* Video codec detection - creating a new video element and checking whether video.canPlayType() returns true for various codecs, including video/ogg; codecs="theora" (Theora with OGG), video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E (H264 MP4), video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis" (WEBM).
* Audio codec detection - creating an audio element and checking whether audio.canPlayType returns true for audio/ogg; codecs="vorbis" (OGG Vorbis), audio/mpeg; (MP3), audio/wav; codecs="1" (WAV), audio/x-m4a; (M4A), audio/aac; (AAC)
* WebGL fingerprinting - Creates a Canvas element with a WebGL context.  Then draws a gradient object with shaders and gets the base64 string with toDataURL.  They then check for the system's max texture anisotropy.  After that, they gather GPU vendor and renderer information with the WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension.
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints and attempting to create a TouchEvent handler (if it's successful then touch is supported)
* Browser vendor - navigator.vendor
* Browser product (should always be equal to "Gecko", even on Chrome based browsers) - navigator.product
* Browser build number - navigator.productSub
* Internet explorer detection through parsing navigator.appName
* Chrome detection (worth noting that this tends to be defined on most Chromium derivatives, including Microsoft Edge) - presence of window.chrome
* Webdriver support (the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#example-1) declares that tools implementing the Webdriver browser automation standard should declare navigator.webdriver as true) - presence of navigator.webdriver
* Current URL protocol - document.location.protocol
* Session history length - window.history.length
* CPU core count - navigator.hardwareConcurrency
* Battery interface support - presence of navigator.getBattery
* Media device (webcams, microphones, speakers) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices
* Cookie support - navigator.cookieEnabled
* Browser appName (always "Netscape" on modern browsers) - navigator.appName
* Screen Color Depth - screen.colorDepth
* String representation of setTimeout function (used to detect tampering, it should return function setTimeout() { [native code] } but if a wrapper is being used it will return something different) - setTimeout.toString()
* String representation of setInterval function (same reasoning as above) - setInterval.toString()

<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work</h3>

<p>After collecting all of this information, Distil then runs its “proof of work.”  Similar to the Cloudflare Under Attack mode, your browser basically generates some sort of token using JavaScript that the server then checks and (hopefully) ensures it was generated with the JavaScript.  Distil’s “proof of work” seems to just be generating random alphanumeric characters and doing some basic math calculations with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function t(e) {
  for (var t = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", r = "", n = 0; e &gt; n; ++n) r += t.substr(Math.floor(Math.random() * t.length), 1);
  return r;
}
h("DistilProofOfWorkStart");
var r = new o, n = (new Date).getTime() + ":" + t(20);
r.mine(n, 8, function (t) {
  h("DistilProofOfWorkStop"), e({proof: t});
});

...

mine: function(e, t, r) {
    for (var i = 0, a = Math.pow(2, 32 - t);;) {
        var o = i.toString(16) + ":" + e;
        i++;
        var s = n(o);
        if (parseInt(s.substr(0, 8), 16) &lt; a) return void r(o)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="browser-automation-testing">Browser Automation Testing</h3>
<p>Following the proof of work, the automated/headless browser detection code is run.  This code is obfuscated.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a large array of strings represented with hexadecimal escaping.  This is a technique most commonly used by <a href="https://obfuscator.io/">obfuscator.io</a>.  This makes it very hard to read – <code>_0x159[54]</code> is much harder to read than “document.”  To undo this obfuscation, I used Jarrod Overson’s great <a href="https://github.com/jsoverson/shift-refactor">shift-refactor</a> library.  It uses Shape Security’s Shift AST to allow you to parse and manipulate JavaScript.  To replace all member expressions (i.e. arr[1]) with their string values, I used the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const { RefactorSession } = require('shift-refactor');
const { parseScript } = require('shift-parser');
const Shift = require('shift-ast');

const fileContents = require('fs').readFileSync('./distillnetworks.js', 'utf8');

const tree = parseScript(fileContents);

const refactor = new RefactorSession(tree);

refactor.replace(
  `ComputedMemberExpression[expression.type="LiteralNumericExpression"][object.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    var referencedArrayName = node.object.name;
    var arrayQuery = `VariableDeclarator[binding.name="` + referencedArrayName + `"][init.type="ArrayExpression"]`;
    var referencedArrayDeclaration = refactor.query(arrayQuery)[0];
    if (!referencedArrayDeclaration) {
      return node;
    }
    if (referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].type !== "LiteralStringExpression") { // if we're working with a non string, return
      return node;
    }
    var newValue = referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].value;
    if (!newValue) {
      return node;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({
        value: newValue,
      });      
    }
  }
);
console.log("/* Replaced all array references with real value */")

console.log(refactor.print());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, we find all of the member expressions (<code>ComputedMemberExpression</code>) that index the array (the <code>IdentifierExpression</code> – though this can refer to any variable) using an integer (<code>LiteralNumericExpression</code>).  We then find the array that is being indexed (searching for the <code>VariableDeclarator</code> of type <code>ArrayExpression</code> with the same name as the referenced variable), get the actual value, make sure it is a string, and then return it if so.  Otherwise, we return the original <code>node</code>.  After running this (<code>node distillnetworks_deobfuscator.js &gt; distillnetworks_deobfuscated.js</code>), readability has massively increased, but there is still much to be desired.</p>

<p>I then noticed one more annoyance.  There was a function, <code>_0x9e50x4</code>, that, if passed “O” as an argument, would return <code>["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"]</code>.  Otherwise, it would return <code>[]</code>.  These strings themselves are not actually used in the code, but their substrings are actually used to assemble other strings.  To replace the <code>_0x9e50x4</code> calls with their real values, I added the following code above the <code>refactor.print</code> call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var _0x9e50x4List = ["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"];
refactor.replaceRecursive(
  `CallExpression[callee.name="_0x9e50x4"][callee.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    if (node.arguments.value="O") {
      var newArray = new Shift.ArrayExpression({elements: []});
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; _0x9e50x4List.length; ++i) {
        newArray.elements.push(new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({value: _0x9e50x4List[i]}));
      }
      return newArray;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.ArrayExpression({
        elements: [],
      })
    }
    return node;
  }
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there was another thing that was hurting my eyes.  <code>_0x9e50x1</code> was being referenced instead of <code>window</code>.  To increase readability, I added another <code>refactor.replace</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var windowObjectName = "_0x9e50x1";
refactor.replace(
  `IdentifierExpression[name="` + windowObjectName + `"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    return new Shift.IdentifierExpression({
      name: "window",
    })
  }
);
console.log("/* Done renaming " + windowObjectName + " …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<h2>Authors</h2>




<h2>Abstract</h2><p>RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.

As such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.

I will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. 

One interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.
