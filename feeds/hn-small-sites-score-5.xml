I recommend you read it through the lens of “recommending Anki to a friend.” This article is about the problems of giving advice on how to learn.</p>
<h2>Spreading the “gospel” to the world</h2>
<p>If you deeply believe something, along the lines of “if everyone did it, the world would be much better off.” and have tried convincing other people to do that thing, then you will realize it’s almost impossible to change others’ opinions or behaviors.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not that ambitious to convince everyone, so you start small: you share it with your friends, but then discovered nobody actually cares or realizes its significance. A mild version is like <a href="https://www.deathbulge.com/comics/206">showing your favorite TV show and they don’t care</a>:</p>

<p>My faith in evidence-based learning strategies is informed by my personal experience and <a href="https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-02-25-how-to-learn-about-meta-learning-my-resource-list">my meta-learning list</a>. I wholeheartedly believe Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) like SuperMemo and Anki is the key to effective and efficient learning. If you believe education is the future, then the knowledge about evidence-based learning strategies is one big key to unlocking that future, both individually and collectively.</p>
<h2>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</h2>
<p>Two years ago I was doing my Anki reps. One friend glanced over and was interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>We ate lunch together while I was giving her a little presentation. I talked <em>very enthusiastically</em> about spaced repetition, basic memory science and Anki operations. Of course I had to show her the infamous forgetting curve:</p>

<p>She sounded excited about the possibility of finally mastering a second language. But at one point she was confused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I hadn’t learned it how could I recall it from memory?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I explained that assessment <strong>for</strong> learning (testing as a means of learning) is different from assessment <strong>of</strong> learning (finding out what you’ve learned). The act of “recalling from memory” is itself a learning process. Then I was aware that her confusion was probably due to a common misconception about memory: human memory works like computer memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional architecture of how humans forget, remember, and learn is <strong>unlike</strong> the corresponding processes in man-made devices […] We think of ourselves as working like computers, we become prone to assuming that exposing ourselves to information and procedures will lead to storage (i.e., recording) of such information or procedures in our memories—that the information will write itself in one’s memory.</p>
<p>If we think of human memory equals to memory in a computer, we are unlikely to appreciate that retrieving information from our memory increases the subsequent accessibility of that information, while retrieving information from computer memory leaves the status of that information unperturbed. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203842539/chapters/10.4324%2F9780203842539-6">On the Symbiosis of Remembering, Forgetting, and Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note: this story might give you the impression that I liked to show off what I know. No not really. I like to be convinced with evidence, and I thought others were the same. I was wrong. Also, I included the above quotes for the sake of convincing you, the reader. I didn’t obfuscate the subject matter further with phrases like assessment <strong>for</strong> learning and assessment <strong>of</strong> learning.</p>
<p>She looked… befuddled. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>I remember I was so excited and nervous at the same time that I was fumbling for words, trying to simplify it as much as I could. In retrospect, I was making things worse.</p>
<p>She’d listen to me quite intently, signaling that she was thinking and trying to figure it out, but I could tell she was still confused. And the more I explained, the deeper the rabbit hole went (like keep clicking hyperlinks in Wikipedia), and the more confused she became, so I stopped talking to stop making the whole situation uncomfortable. The following monologue is how I imagine what she was thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s so passionate about this stuff and so sure of himself that I guess he’s right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure what he means. I do want to learn Japanese but the stuff he’s talking about is so confusing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was indeed interested in the beginning, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just going to pretend I understand and end this whole conversation asap.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what she said at one point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like “Yeah…” I never followed up on her progress. I figured if she was truly interested, when she bumped into problem she would ask for my help. As expected, we never talked about it and I never mentioned Anki again.</p>

<p>These has happened countless times. I usually look nonchalant on the outside but dying on the inside. People looked interested (probably due to my enthusiasm and it’s impolite to look otherwise) and then never actually bothered to use Anki. Some would actually try, make a few cards, do the reps for a few days and then say, “I tried and Anki doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I’m probably over my head, but sometimes it feels like I’m personally attacked, that what I’m saying is not valuable. I understand it’s not true, but it took me years to study the learning science and to gain the experience with Anki/SuperMemo. The fact that they’re dismissing the software feels like they’re dismissing my knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2>The problems of giving advice on how to learn</h2>
<h3>#1. Nobody cares <em>that</em> much, alright?</h3>
<p>When I first discovered Anki I was like, “How come no one around me knows this?! I need to share this to everyone!” So I would tell my friends about Anki but nobody was interested. I’ve introduced Anki to people and every time it’s a very frustrating experience. (Surprise surprise, not SuperMemo. The learning curve of Anki is much lower. What chance do I have if I preached SuperMemo when they even think Anki is too hard to use?)</p>
<p>Update: I was never a missionary and randomly went out my way to tell people about Anki all the time like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com/">Source</a></p>
<p>Very early on I did give unsolicited advice once to my best friend by intentionally bringing up Anki. Then I did bring up Anki on multiple occasions, but only when the opportunity presented itself, like the story above.</p>
<p>People may be interested in how you’ve developed a skill or become fluent in a foreign language, but just not <strong>that</strong> interested. And they certainly don’t expect to be suddenly lectured on how learning and memory work.</p>
<p>I never liked following up to people with questions like “So how’s Anki? Have you used it?” It feels like pushing an agenda to them. Also, since most would not even bother buying and downloading the app, their response is usually, “I forgot about it. I’ll do it later.” and the conversation would end in an awkward tone.</p>
<h3>#2. I’m not sure if I actually want it, alright?</h3>
<p>Sometimes people keep lamenting “I want to learn X or I want to get better grades.” How many times do you hear people say they want to learn a second language? This is like that friend who keeps saying “I want to lose weight”. Probably after all, they’re just lamenting and not yet ready to put in the effort to change.</p>
<p>Trying to convince others to use Anki/SuperMemo is like trying to convince your friends to go to the gym regularly. You can talk about the benefits of exercising/weight-lifting, how good you’ll feel afterwards, how much more productive you’ll be and so on. But nothing will work if they don’t try it in the first place, and it doesn’t help that spaced repetition doesn’t work in the short-term since using Spaced Repetition Software is a life-long pursuit (just as learning is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp; vivid. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern’s Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>#3. Why are you so hyped about it?</h3>
<p>It’s rare if people could understand and realize the significance and application of Spaced Repetition Software in a casual 10-min chat. It’s not about the complexity (it’s not rocket science after all), but rather it’s about awareness: problems with current learning approaches and how Anki/SuperMemo could solve the problems. In other words, if I don’t see the problems, why bother changing?</p>
<p>I have a friend who was learning German. She copied German vocabulary on one side and the equivalent English on the other in a notebook. I showed her my Korean Anki cards: “Take a look at these beautiful images! Gifs! Sentence cards! Audio clips! Mass Immersion Approach! (Former: All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)), Stephen Krashen’s Input Hypothesis!” Then I had another friend who was studying to become a nurse. I told him about Anki: “Image occlusion for anatomy!” It felt wrong of me to be hiding Anki (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">Image Occlusion</a> to be specific) from him. Deep down I want to shove their faces to this table:</p>

<p>I was exaggerating but you get the point: it’s not possible to convey the significance and application of it all in a casual 10-min chat. With the benefit of hindsight, all my attempts could’ve been a lot better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I was so convinced and have so much faith in Spaced Repetition Software that I came off as condescending, giving off the impression like “you don’t know how to study; let me teach you.”</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the bold claims: “You’ll get 2x results with half the study time.” (How many are really true whenever you hear such claim?)</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the situation: all he or she wants is someone to listen about the difficulty of studying, not some real advice or suggestions.</li>

        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.

    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.

    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.

        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.

    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.

      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">
    
    <p>
It's especially useful when you want to turn a satellite photo into a map. Or if you want to scan some blueprint and turn it into a CAD model. Or if you want to reissue an old game and you don't want to redraw all the artwork from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
The algorithm I'm going to show you has nothing to do with all these things. It's a basic vectorization technique which, in its original form, has little to none applications in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
On the plus side, it illustrates the approach rather well. It shows how things like bilinear interpolation, gradient descent, and parametric splines work together to solve a real-world problem. At the very least, it makes learning about all these things a little more compelling.
    </p>

    <h2>
An input image
    </h2>
    <p>
A raster image is essentially a rectangular table of things. If it's a full-color RGB, then it's a table of color pixels. Color pixels are the triplets of 8-bit integer values where each value represents an amount of red, green, and blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
Medical images, such as obtained from computed tomography, are usually the tables of 12-bit or 16-bit integers. It's not a color really since the values come from invisible X-ray radiation, but they are called gray values nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
Satellite images may have a lot of channels. Apart from the colors of the visible specter they may contain ultra-violet and infra-red luminosity. Channels may be represented by integers or floating point values.
    </p>
    <p>
Our image will be a simple gray-scale bitmap.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Technically, we can already turn it into vectors rather easily. Let's just agree on some threshold, and mark the contour of all the pixels that have the values exceeding this threshold.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas_contour" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Well, it's simple, but it's not what we wanted. We want curves, not corners. And for that, we have to make our image less cornery.
    </p>
    <h2>
<span id="index_image_interpolation">Image interpolation</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's say our image is not a table of values. Let's say we only know the values in the centers of the pixels, and we have to guess the values between them somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
This is called interpolation. The simplest case would be the nearest neighbor interpolation, where for every point on an image, the value is the value from the nearest pixel's center. But this simply turns it back into a table.
    </p>
    <p>
A little more advanced is the <span id="index_bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</span>. The value is the linear sum of the four neighboring values. It looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_1">// pixel value with out of bounds checks
function pixel_in(pixels, i, j) {
    if(i &gt;= pixels.length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, pixels.length-1, j);
    if(i &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, 0, j);
    if(j &gt;= pixels[0].length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, pixels[0].length-1);
    if(j &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, 0);
    return pixels[i][j];
}

// linear interpolation
function value_in(pixels, x, y) {
    var j = Math.floor(x - 0.5);
    var tj = x - 0.5 - j;
    var i = Math.floor(y - 0.5);
    var ti = y - 0.5 - i;
    return pixel_in(pixels, i, j) * (1 - ti) * (1 - tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i, j+1) * (1 - ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j+1) * (ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j) * (ti) * (1 - tj);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
If we darken the pixels where the interpolated value meets the threshold, we'll get some kind of a contour.
    </p>
    <canvas id="interpolation_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    
    <p>
There are other methods. Plenty of them. But linear interpolation solves the cornery border problem just fine. Although, the border we see is just the borderline of some threshold. It's not a vector representation yet.
    </p>

    <h2>
Turning an interpolated image into a contour
    </h2>
    <p>
We can borrow an idea from the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_simplest_possible_smooth_contouring_algorithm.html">simplest possible smooth contouring</a> algorithm. We'll build an initial border from the source pixels, and then we'll use our linearly interpolated image to find the best place to put each contour point so the image value will meet the threshold value.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have a <span id="index_distance_field">distance field</span>, it's easy. A distance field is when for any point in space you can tell how far it lies from the surface you want. It's basically a function from point in space to distance.
    </p>
    <p>
You take its gradient, take the difference between the value you have and the threshold value. Since it's the distance field, the value difference is exactly the distance you should move your point for. And the gradient is the exact opposite direction. You just inverse, multiply, add — and you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a distance field. We have a continuous image which only resembles one.
    </p>
    <p>
But the principle still works. If you traverse against the gradient, you will get closer to the threshold value. And the more the difference, the further you have to go. It's just you wouldn't always get there in one try.
    </p>
    <p>
So let's try several times then. Let's make an <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_introduction_to_iterative_algorithms.html">iterative algorithm</a> out of it.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_2">// gradient
function gradient(pixels, x, y) {
    const eps = 1e-5;
    return [(value_in(pixels, x + eps, y) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps,
            (value_in(pixels, x, y + eps) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps];
}

// how far should you shift the point to meet the isoline
// if value_in were a distance function
function gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, x, y) {
    var g = gradient(pixels, x, y);
    var g_norm = Math.sqrt(g[0]*g[0] + g[1]*g[1]);
    var d = threshold - value_in(pixels, x, y);
    return [g[0] * d / g_norm / g_norm, g[1] * d / g_norm / g_norm];
}

// brings a point closer to the threshold isoline
function fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, point) {
    const ok_error = 1/255;
    if(Math.abs(value_in(pixels, point[0], point[1]) - threshold) &lt; ok_error)
        return point;
    gs = gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, point[0], point[1])
    var new_point = [point[0] + gs[0], point[1] + gs[1]];
    return fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, new_point);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
We'll move our contour points against the gradient until we're close enough to the threshold
    </p>
    <canvas id="fitting_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
        
    <p>
That's good but we can do better. Let's make the contour smooth.
    </p>

    <h2>
Cubic splines
    </h2>
    <p>
All we have to do to make the contour smooth is to turn each line segment into a parametric cubic curve.
    </p>
    <p>
It's probably sounds more complicated than it is. A parametric cubic curve is just a pair of polynomials. If you have the points and partial derivatives in this points, you can get the coefficients for them from this pair of <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/programmers_introduction_to_linear_equations.html">linear systems</a>:
    </p>
    <div><p>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dx<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = x<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = x<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dx<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p><p>
    
Py(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dy<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Py(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = y<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = y<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dy<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p></div>
    <p>
The curve itself will then look like this.
    </p>
    <canvas id="cubic_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Even more, since we get to choose the parameter range, we can make it [0..1]. This greatly simplifies our system and makes it really easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the function that makes one array of polynomial coefficients from two pairs of point and tangent values.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_3">// solver specific to [0..1] parametrized splines
function spline_for(p1, p1d, p2, p2d) {
//     A = [
//         [1, 0, 0, 0],
//         [0, 1, 0, 0],
//         [1, 1, 1, 1],
//         [0, 1, 2, 3]];
//     B = [p1, p1d, p2, p2d]
    return [
        p1,
        p1d,
        3*p2 - p2d - 3*p1 - 2*p1d,
        p2d + p1d - 2*p2 + 2*p1
    ];
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
The polynomial is then computed in every <i>t</i> with this function.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_4">// polynomial
function polynomial_in_t(A, t){
    var pt = 0.0;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; A.length; ++i){

So for every line segment with tangents, we can make a parametric polynomial. There is one problem though. We don't have tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
We have the gradient, which is orthogonal to the tangent, but there are two possible tangents in every point. The tangent can be oriented left or right from the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
But this is solvable. Let's just pick the direction we like and keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
Let the curves that originally come from horizontally oriented segments always have both tangents that way that <i>dx &gt; 0</i>. And the ones that come from vertically oriented segments, will have <i>dy &gt; 0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
It looks like we have enough parts to assemble an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>
Creating splines from the pixels
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's split our vectorization into two parts. First, we'll get points and tangents for every line segment from the pixels. Then we'll turn it all into polynomial splines.
    </p>
    <p>
The function that does the first part looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_5">function turn_pixels_into_points_and_tangents(pixels, threshold) {
    var points = [];
    var tangents = [];

    // "horizontal" pieces
    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= pixels.length; i += 1) {
        var old_point = [];
        var old_tangent = [];
        for(var j = 0; j &lt;= pixels[0].length; j += 1) {
            // if right, left, top, and bottom pixels have a sign change,
            // there should be a spline there
            var sign_change_on_the_right  =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j+0) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_left   =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j-1) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j-1) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_bottom =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j-1) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_top    =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j-1) - threshold) *

, I structured my lessons around primary sources such as the Bitcoin white paper and the Ethereum yellow paper.</p><p>This way, my students learned not only what I know, but also what’s the source of the knowledge. Now that they’re graduated, they know where to look for when they have questions.</p><p>Even though the course was four weeks long for each batch I could not answer some excellent questions in detail. Instead, I had to resort to black boxes.</p><p>How do digital signatures work? A black box.</p><p>What about ZK-STARKs? Another black box.</p><p>Black boxes help to teach a subject. Not so much for understanding in detail.</p><p>To understand Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more on a deeper level, one should know the pillars they are built on.</p><p>You understand the strength of the Bitcoin network when you know how does SHA-256 work.</p><p>You understand how your contracts run once you know the inner-working of the EVM.</p><p>You understand the security of the protocols you invest in when you, well, know a lot.</p><p>Thus, as you understand these subjects, you will realize how important blockchain really is. You will probably want to contribute to these exciting projects.</p><p>The more you will know, the more you will be able to participate in the governance of blockchains.</p><p>What should be the block size?</p><p>What’re your opinions on various layer 2 protocols?</p><p>How can you help us approaching the open questions on scalability?</p><p>All you need to do is to join the conversations, as long as you know about the subject in depth.</p><p>I recently realized that the most technical issues are getting the least participation.</p><p>Then, I decided to create this blog series with the goal of having new voices on the future of blockchain governances.</p><p>New voices that understand the contemporary issues very well.</p><p>This is one of the best things I can do for crypto.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One bull market to learn the lesson. Second bull market to make retirement money. Third bull market to ask not what crypto can do for you but what you can do for crypto.</p>— Qiao Wang (@QwQiao) <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1299500501604667396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2><p>The series will demand the reader to be comfortable with computer science papers. In fact, the content will be the papers.</p><p>My job is to curate the papers, explain their contexts in the blockchain space, and clarify them with my reading notes.</p><p>Ultimately, the series will offer a fundamental understanding of blockchain technologies to eager readers, be it economics students or CS professors.</p><h2 id="the-papers">The Papers</h2><p>I’m proud to present you 67 primary sources on the science of blockchains.

	<p>
Floating-point numbers are fine. They are decently designed and well standardized, they provide a good compromise between performance and precision. They work great most of the time. Until the day when they suddenly don't and nobody knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
For me, that day came when I encountered a bug in the Taubin estimator. <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-01-fall/Papers/taubin-smoothing.pdf">Taubin smoothing</a> takes a triangle mesh, a pair of magic numbers called λ and μ, a little time to think, and it makes the input mesh smooth. It also makes sure that the mesh isn't reduced to a perfectly smooth but rather uninteresting sphere or a point.
	</p>
	<p>
The first magic number λ is something between 0 and 1. When it's 0 — nothing happens at all, and when it's 1 — nothing good happens either. It should be somewhere in between. Nobody really knows how to pick this number but an experienced engineer can at least make an educated guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
The second magic number governs shrinkage compensation. It's a negative number slightly greater than λ in its absolute value. Nobody knows how to pick it either but this time even an educated guess is a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
That's why you need an estimator. Something that picks the μ for you. And we have one. And it was bugged. And I was the one to fix it.
	</p>
	<p>
The first day of the investigation showed that the estimator is in fact entirely correct. The second day of the investigation  showed that the tests covering the bug are correct just as well. The third day of the investigation brought a promising hypothesis that the whole story is just a bad dream and all it takes to solve the mystery is to wake up. The fourth morning killed that hypothesis and left me completely clueless.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily I have a friend who is smarter than me and he advised to fuzz the input a little and see what happens then. I did. And something happened. The bug didn't go away but the μ changed a lot. Way unproportionally to the small changes in the input. Fascinating!
	</p>
	<p>
We can expect a computation to work with some error. It's fine, we get input data from sensors and they embed some error, to begin with. We print out our finished models, and the printers have some limited precision as well so a small error doesn't upset anyone. It's all good while the error is small. But what if it isn't?
	</p>
	<p>
As it turns out, in my case, a completely correct algorithm had a computational error of about 1. Not 1e-16 or 1e-5 but 1. Just 1. So if you expect your μ to be somewhat close to -0.7, and the estimator says it's 0.3, it is in fact correct. It is still a correct estimation within its error range.
	</p>
	<p>
Correct but entirely useless.
	</p>
	<h2>
Challenge your intuition with a “Guess the Error” game
	</h2>
	<p>
Ok, so it's not the computational error per se that causes trouble but only the unexpected and unpredictable error. Can we predict it though?
	</p>
	<p>
Well, of course, we can. There is a whole field of numerical error analysis for that but let's be honest, most of the time we use our intuition instead. So how good is our intuition exactly?
	</p>
	<p>
I propose a game to find out. Let's take a cubic equation solver. It's a relatively complex computation with a very simple way to validate its precision. We will pick some roots first and then we will generate the cubic equation for these roots. Then we'll make the cubic solver find our roots back through the computation. The difference between the original and the computed value for each root will be our measurable error. This error divided by the original value will be our relative error.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the exact code for the experiment. It's also <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/master/exp/rational_bounds/rationale/cubic_solver_example.cpp">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
Now if we pick our roots as 1, 2, and 3, the equation produced will be:
	</p>
	<p>
(x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) = 0
	</p>
	<p>
Expanding the brackets we get this:
	</p>
	<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 6 = 0
	</p>
	<p>
And when we run our solver we get:
	</p>
	<p>
x = 1, x = 2, x = 3
	</p>
	<p>
Well, yes. On the equation this simple there is no error whatsoever. The computation works flawlessly. So let's start making it worse.
	</p>
	<h2>Round 1</h2>
	<p>
The slider below lets you pick an interval in the logarithmic scale. The interval may start at 10<sup>-12</sup> and end at 10<sup>12</sup>. It's impossible to predict the exact error up to a single number so you should just pick an appropriate interval that covers the error<span id="shown_note_1"><u onclick="show('note_1')">*</u>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say we have the roots of 0.001, 2, 3 000. So to which interval, in your opinion, the maximum relative error for a cubic solver belongs?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_1" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 2</h2>
	<p>
Now let's make our roots even more diverse in magnitude. How about 1e-6, 2, and 3e6?
	</p>
	<p>
Where do you think the error might be?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_2" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 3</h2>
	<p>
And what about 1e-9, 2, and 3e9?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_3" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	
	<h2>Meet the <span id="index_rational_bounds">rational bounds</span></h2>
	<p>
It's not the error per se that is bad. Error is omnipresent. Every measuring device has its error, every 3D printer and every milling machine has its maximal precision. The error is fine.
	</p>
	<p>
It's only the unpredictability that makes it unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
People address errors in multiple ways. In metrology, a measured value is supplemented with its absolute error. You don't say that the temperature outside is 10°, you say it's 10° ± 0.5°. This might seem redundant since this is a small error for the weather outside, but in some other context, this very error might become significant. If you're measuring body temperature, a 1-degree difference is enough to tell a sick person from a perfectly healthy one. You can not afford a whole 1-degree error in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have this input error written down, you can pull it through your computation to see if the resulting error is still tolerable. To do that, you need to exchange your measured numbers for intervals. A number with error becomes an interval: 10° ± 0.5° becomes [9.5, 10.5]°.
	</p>
	<p>
You can sum these intervals just as you add numbers:
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_4" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
+
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_5" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_6" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
You can multiply them as well.
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_7" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
×
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_8" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_9" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
So with intervals, you can accommodate the input error. You can drag it through the computation and see how it plays with other values with their own error. In the end, you will have your computed value within some interval and the size of this interval will indicate the output error. But what about the error of the computation itself?
	</p>
	<p>
A computational error occurs when we can't store the operation result in the same types we keep our operands in and we're forced to throw some data away. Let's say we have Python-style “unlimited” length integers. This means that if our computation only consists of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we would never face any computational error.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, with division, things get a little bit different. E. g. we can't store <nobr>16 ¾</nobr> in integers so we have to truncate it into 16. In this case, the whole fractional part becomes our error.
	</p>
	<p>
We can use pairs of integers to represent rational numbers. This will solve the division issue. However, this type of rational number, while does not accumulate errors, accumulates digits. The more digits it has, the slower the computation goes. At some point, it may simply become impractically slow. Just like with the uncontrollable error, uncontrollable size becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
We want a compromise. Some entity that grows error controllably yet still operates in constant speed. And we can get it, for example, by merging two ideas: intervals and rational numbers together.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say, we want to write a number as an interval of its tenths. We can do that most intuitively by throwing away all the digits after the first one.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Just like we can do this with decimal fraction, we can do this with any rational number. We can put it between a pair of rational numbers made by finite integers. In this case, every integer is in the range [0, 1, ..., 99].
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Ok, this is not entirely true. If the number is greater than 99, then we can't really store it in our tiny rationals but we can say that it's larger than 99 by assigning the 0 divisor to its upper bound. Of course, it's just a dirty hack but let's leave it like that.
	</p>
	<p>
Now if we want to accommodate both input error and computational error, all we have to do is to represent an input interval in its finite rational numbers. A finite rational lower bound of this interval and a finite rational upper bound of the same interval.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
This entity — a pair of finite rational bounds, represents a real number along with both its input error and representational error. It also grows computational error explicitly while the size of the entity remains constant.
	</p>
	<p>
The implementation example is <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/tree/master/exp/rational_bounds/sketch_in_cpp">available on GitHub</a>. Please note that it's just a proof of concept and not the best possible solution in terms of neither error minimization nor speed.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
The computational error may become a problem at the least appropriate moment. Both rational numbers and intervals are well-known alternatives for floating-point numbers when the error becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
Rational bounds, being a chimeric product of both ideas, let you manage both measurement error and computational error in a coherent way without compromising performance all that much.
	</p>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting desination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia ala Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application-level_gateway">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>In the context of computer networking, an application-level 
gateway consists of a security component that augments a 
firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows 
customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the 
gateway to support address and port translation for certain 
application layer "control/data" protocols such as FTP, 
BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. 
In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a 
firewall, either the application has to know about an address/
port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the 
NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port 
mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. 
Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the 
security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have 
otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited 
filter criteria.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="router-investigation--firmware-dumping">Router Investigation / Firmware Dumping</h2>

<p>I'd first like to see how common gateways actually treat packets and multi-port protocols like FTP, SIP, etc. To do this, we’ll want to reverse engineer the firmware from common routers. We could dump the flash from physical routers, however if we can get unencrypted firmware from the manufacturers, we’ll be able to investigate more router models and much faster.</p>

<p>We'll start with a common router, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/NjZh">quick search</a> helps us …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Programming is a game of abstractions, and we programmers traffic in ideas.
When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorites. There’s a recency bias; I can’t remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Ben Kuhn</a> for this idea!</p>
<h3>Essays</h3>
<p>Jeff Atwood, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/">The First Rule of Programming: It’s Always Your Fault</a>. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like “Found a bug in React?” paired with an
introductory sentence: “I’m brand new to React.” It’s human to assume there’s a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay’s point is that it’s
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn’t stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying “hey, this is my fault— and I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
— Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Shawn Wang, <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">expert beginner</a> status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: “The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
— Shawn Wang</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Elisabeth Hendrickson, <a href="https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/">Momentum &gt;
Urgency</a>. I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I’ve worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn’t a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They’ll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
— Elisabeth Hendrickson</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Scott Hanselman, <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?</a>.
This post isn’t just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I’m making efficient use of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
— Scott Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/">The Iceberg Secret,
Revealed</a>.
Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don’t write software don’t automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What
They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are
going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>. When you’re asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you’ve tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn’t be asking for help right?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Jon Evans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/">Why The New Guy Can’t
Code</a>. The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn’t accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.
— Jon Evans</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Paul Slaughter, <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional comments</a>. I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I’ve
been a part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!
— Paul Slaughter</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, <a href="https://www.nagekar.com/2018/06/advice-from-an-old-programmer-zed-shaw.html">Advice From An Old Programmer</a>. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It’s a question I’m
grappling with. I’m choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.
— Zed Shaw</p>

Business does not. Copying is a zero-sum game and all participating players will compete profits away until they reach a Nash-equilibrium, where a further lowering of price, and thus margins, is unsustainable.

There are certain guidelines successful businesses seem to use but in the end, you’ll still have to go with your gut and make a judgment call according to your own ethical values.</em></p><p>Arguably, replicating findings is one of the best tools we have in our scientific arsenal in order to test the validity of a conclusion.</p><p>Which is why the psychology community was not amused when the methodological crisis now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">Replication crisis</a> started, where it was discovered that many studies weren’t replicable (Nosek et al., 2015).</p><p>Even some of the most cited and well-known studies such as the study that power posing makes you act bolder (Carney, Cuddy &amp; Yap, 2010).</p><p>Which, incidentally, is why it’s so important to not just reference research (instead of parroting some YouTube influencer or blogger) but to also carefully analyze the literature and its limitations yourself. *1</p><p>This doesn’t guarantee perfection, but it does decrease obvious and preventable mistakes.</p><p>JP Ioannidis pointed out serious problems with published research in ‘’Why most published research findings are false.’’</p><blockquote><p>‘’ Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.’’ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" target="_blank">Ioannidis, 2005</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Methodological issues aside, replication matters.</p><p>Well, that’s all fine and dandy weren’t it for the pesky fact that our field relies on innovation.</p><p>Even if you extract all the knowledge from the brains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom" target="_blank">Kevin Systrom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" target="_blank">Mike Krieger </a>and build Instagram, you’d get the complete opposite result because Instagram already exists.</p><p>Even Kevin and Mike can’t replicate it because the variables have changed.</p><p>The entire environment and current social climate (regarding privacy, advertising, users as the product, and social media addiction) are different, and even if it weren’t, no user is gonna switch to an IG clone when IG already exists.</p><p>There are some guidelines that most successful companies seem to follow, however, you can’t formulate a step-by-step plan for the reasons laid out above.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank">Peter Thiel</a> was one of the first to point out this distinction between companies that go from 0 to 1, innovation, and companies that go from 1 to n (copying), in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>.</p><p>Companies that do copy and thus employ a formula they copied from another company open themselves up to fierce competition.</p><p>As more players participate in this zero-sum game, the fixed pie of users and profits will get competed away because there are too many mouths to feed with finite resources. *2</p><p>If you copy each other with no (or no meaningful) distinctions then price will be the only thing you can compete on, which is exactly what we see in commodity markets.</p><p>Player B will lower prices in order to steal market share from Player A. Player A lowers them still. Player C lowers it below both of them. Player D goes too low and goes bankrupt.</p><p>Over time, price will collapse into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank">Nash-equilibrium</a>.</p><p>A point where no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. Go below the current price point and you go out of business because the unit economics fail. Go above the current price point and you go out of business because there’s no good reason for users to pay more for the exact same product. *3</p><p>Unless one player, usually a new one, sufficiently innovates and thus creates a whole new business model. In effect, changing the game. This is essentially the raison d’etre of a startup, and it’s why <a href="https://steveblank.com/about/">Steve Blank</a> defined a startup as: ‘‘a temporary organization <strong>used to search</strong> for a repeatable and scalable business model.’’</p><p>This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that we go through traditional education by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A system that’s not designed to teach independent thinking but rather to reward obedience and implementing rules.</p><p>If you think that’s my opinion instead of the facts, then watch this to get a better understanding of how our modern education system was formed:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_31181"><div><p>If you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a short trip with you to use mathematics as an analogy.</p><p>In mathematical set theory, there’s something called the axiom of choice&nbsp;(AoC).</p><p>Without making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">AoC</a> too complex, picture this:</p><p>Suppose you have 3 jars: Jar 1, Jar 2, Jar 3.</p><p>Each jar contains a piece of paper with a few whole numbers written on it.</p><p>Jar 1: 4, 8, 45</p><p>Jar 2: 646, 23</p><p>Jar 3: 894, 7, 45649, 54, 76</p><p>Now I can make a new jar: Jar 4, which contains one element from each of the jars.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_34730"><div><p>Okay… in order to do that we need to build some machine where we can put something in and it spits something out (a function).</p><p>Let’s create a function that just ‘’chooses’’ the smallest element in each jar.</p><p>So it picks: 4 from Jar 1, 23 from Jar 2 and 7 from Jar 3.</p><p>So now we can put a piece of paper in Jar 4 with 4, 23, 7 on it.</p><p>We’ve created a choice function ‘’pick the smallest element out of each jar’’ that creates a new set (Jar 4) with the chosen elements.</p><p>Even if we had infinite jars, this function always works.</p><p>Because with natural numbers (whole numbers 1 and up), there’s always ‘a smallest’.</p><p>But what if we have an interval in Jar 2 such as (3,5].</p><p>The symbol ( means 3 is not included.</p><p>This creates a problem because what’s the smallest element we should pick now?</p><p>3.1? Well, what about half that 3.05?</p><p>Well, what about half of that again 3.025?</p><p>No matter how close we get to 3 we can always choose a smaller element so our choice function doesn’t work here.</p><p>When you invoke the AoC you claim that even though we don’t know what the choice function is, you’re going to assume there is one.&nbsp;</p><p>(That there is a way to pick one element out of each jar and create a new jar with those elements.)</p><p>An analogy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a> came up with is that if you have an infinite pair of shoes you can create a choice function: Pick the left shoe from every pair.</p><p>But if you have an infinite pair of identical socks, there’s no such thing as right or left, so you can’t create a choice function to pick one sock from each pair and therefore have to invoke the AoC.</p><p>The AoC is something that can not be proven or disproven, you either invoke it or you don’t.</p><p>If you use it, it allows you to do certain kinds of mathematics but also creates paradoxes such as the Banach-Tarski paradox.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hard to explain without mathematics but a sketchy way to think about it is that it’s possible to break a sphere into pieces, rotated them and you get your sphere back, rotate them differently and you have two spheres with the same volume as the original.</em></p><p>And if you don’t invoke the AoC, there’s certain mathematics you can’t do.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_43081"><div><p>Just like not knowing the existence of a choice function and invoking the Axiom of Choice, we often can’t know the best way to proceed in business under the current market and technology circumstances.</p><p>We often can’t prove or disprove our hypotheses, especially when you’re innovating, so reason fails us to some extent.</p><p>We talked about the limitations of reason and the upside of using a more Darwinian approach in the essay series: ‘‘<a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/illogical" target="_blank">Why Your Business Needs More Weird Ideas.</a>’’</p><p>In essence, you’re saying: ‘‘It’s fundamentally impossible to determine what the best way to innovate is, but I’m just gonna assume there is a way.’’</p><p>It’s an enigmatic problem so you just have to take a stance and make a decision according to your ethical values.</p><p>I want to end with an excerpt from the interview with Andrew Mason, the Founder and early CEO of&nbsp;Groupon.</p><p><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/andrew-mason-on-groupon.html" target="_blank">The Quick Rise and Even Faster Fall of Groupon, Through the Eyes of Its CEO.</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>There was one other part of the letter that says your biggest regrets are the moments that you let a lack of data override your intuition of what’s best for the customers. What did you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Groupon started out with these really tight principles about how the site was going to work, really being pro-customer. And as we expanded people in the company would say, “Hey, why don’t we try running two deals a day?” “Why don’t we start sending two emails a day?” And I’d think, <em>That sounds awful. Who wants to get two emails every single day from a company. </em>And they’d be like, <em>Sure, it sounds awful to you. But we’re a data-driven company, so why don’t we let the data decide? Why don’t we do a test?</em> And we’d do a test, and it would show that maybe people would unsubscribe at a slightly higher rate, but the increase in purchasing would more than make up for it. You’d get in a situation where it doesn’t feel right, but it does seem like a rational decision.</p><p>The problem was when you’re in hypergrowth like this, you don’t have time to see what is going to happen to the data in the long term. The churn would catch up with you. People would unsubscribe at higher rates, and then, before you know it, the service has just turned into something — if you look at Groupon now, it’s just this vestige of what it once was. There’s no real copywriting. It’s a marketplace of coupons. It’s still a service that a lot of people get a lot of value out of, but it doesn’t have the spirit it once did.</p><p>There are certain things you have to be religious about in the company. That’s what I’ve taken away from that: There are some things where you have to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going to look at the data on that. This is just what we’re going to do. We know that it’s right, and there’s nothing that’s going to shake us from that.” (Blumberg, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><em>*1 The fact that almost everyone is lazy and assume others have done their homework vs. doing the hard work of checking it themselves is a cognitive error known as </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"><em>diffusion of responsibility</em></a><em>. ‘’The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.’’</em></p><p><em>*2 This is often …</em></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <td colspan="3">
            
            <div id="content">
              <p>I have a couple of different stationary computers. A
                custom-built PC running Windows, an iMac G3 running Mac
                OS 9 and an old HP microtower running Alpine Linux,
                acting as a home server of sorts. Out of all these, I
                spend most of my time on the Windows PC. I use Windows
                for the majority of my work, including a large part of
                the programming that I do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Even though I mainly use Windows, most of my
                web/software development is grounded in or at least
                inspired by Unix in some way: most obviously, I use Git,
                which is a tool designed for the Unix shell. This turns
                out to be a rather awkward match: on the one hand, I use
                Windows Explorer to manage the files; on the other hand,
                I have a command prompt open to manage the repository.</p>
              <p>For my workflow, it would be much better if the Git
                commands were integrated into Explorer itself. So I
                added what amounts to the following code to <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/">my AutoHotKey
                  script</a>: <br>
              </p>

              <p>(The actual code is contained in <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/tree/tt.programs.explorer.ahk">this

                  file</a>, most of it near the bottom.) </p>
              <p>This adds a bunch of hotkeys to any Explorer window:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt><b>Alt-A</b></dt>
                <dd>"git add" the selected file; then "git status"<br>
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-C</b></dt>
                <dd>"git commit"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-C</b></dt>
                <dd>"git commit --amend"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-F</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-F</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff" the selected file</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-I</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff", comparing the previous and current
                  commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-I</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff" the selected file, comparing the previous
                  and current commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log" the selected file<br>
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-P</b></dt>
                <dd>"git push"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-R</b></dt>
                <dd>"git reset" the selected file; then "git status"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-S</b></dt>
                <dd>"git status"</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>All of these hotkeys open a new command prompt window,
                displaying the results of the Git command, which the
                user can close by pressing any key.</p>
              <p>In my experience, these hotkeys make it incalculably
                less bothersome to work with Git on Windows, and I think
                it shows how incredibly useful even very simple
                AutoHotKey scripts can be. If you have any suggestions
                on other hotkeys, please write a comment below.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>

<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyObject</span><span>*</span>
<span>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault</span><span>(</span><span>PyThreadState</span> <span>*</span><span>tstate</span><span>,</span> <span>PyFrameObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>throwflag</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ... declarations and initialization of local variables</span>
    <span>// ... macros definitions</span>
    <span>// ... call depth handling</span>
    <span>// ... code for tracing and profiling</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>(;;)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ... check if the bytecode execution must be suspended,</span>
        <span>// e.g. other thread requested the GIL</span>

        <span>oparg</span> <span>=</span> <span>_Py_OPARG</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>);</span>
        <span>next_instr</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>

        <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>opcode</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>NOP</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>FAST_DISPATCH</span><span>();</span> <span>// more on this later</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_FAST</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// ... code for loading local variable</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>// ... 117 more cases for every possible opcode</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_time#Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American survey,</a> children&nbsp;between the ages of 8-12 and 13-18 spend a daily average of 4 hours, 44 minutes and 7 hours, 22 minutes respectively, staring at screens.</p>
<p>The data for these numbers were collected in 2019. For adults, this figure is higher and according to an article on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post </a>earlier this year, the amount of screen time increased considerably during the quarantine period due to <strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Today, mobile devices take a large percentage of the amount of time people spend staring at screens, this is why there is a need for applications to have a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> option for its users.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> according to <strong>Wikipedia,</strong><em> is a color scheme that uses light-coloured text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design.</em></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the 5 reasons why <strong>Dark Mode</strong> really matters for the end-users of an application!<br>
<a name="reasons-for-dark-mode"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons For Dark Mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg" alt="visual appeal" width="1055" height="703" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"><br>
<a name="visual-attraction"></a></p>
<h3>1). Visual Attraction</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> when applied in the right manner always looks really appealing to the eye. It provides the opportunity to present a unique user interface to the end-users of an application.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of data presentation for graphical contents like dashboards that contain graphs and charts, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> brings out the elegance in the design as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png" alt="Dark Mode" width="1106" height="575" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"></p>
<p>Unlike the drab white look that most applications have, the above image shows how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> can bring a significantly deeper and more attractive visual perception to an application.<br>
<a name="user-experience"></a></p>
<h3>2). User Experience</h3>
<p>Providing the users of a product with the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is a good business decision, especially if the application requires users to spend lots of time on the application. A streaming site, for example, implementing a dark mode feature is a good business decision.</p>
<p>Streaming a video in <strong>light-mode</strong> under a dark environment or at night may not be a good experience for the eyes. Hence, applications that require people spending lots of screen time should provide an option for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for a better user experience.</p>
<p>Above all, it is worthy to note that context is a key factor in making decisions on whether to implement the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong>.<br>
<a name="eye-strain"></a></p>
<h3>3). Eye Strain &amp; Blue Light Removal</h3>
<p>By default, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce overall screen brightness. Although no study has outrightly confirmed that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> reduces eye strain, it can, however, be effective in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce exposure to <strong>Blue Light.</strong>&nbsp;Blue light is a high-frequency colour in the “visible light spectrum” that can be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg" alt="blue-light" width="990" height="660" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></p>
<p><strong>Blue Light&nbsp;</strong>can be found almost everywhere, from smartphones to computers and other digital devices. Another source of Blue Light is the sun, so by stepping out of your house, you are exposed to a certain degree of blue light.</p>
<p>Too many exposures to Blue Light can lead to digital eye strain.</p>
<p>Since not everyone can see well with <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters. This can be found in the display settings area and can be easily adjusted to the level of blue light exposure you want.<br>
<a name="reduction-of-photophobia"></a></p>
<h3>4). Reduction of Photophobia</h3>
<p>Photophobia is a symptom of abnormal intolerance to the visual perception of light. The source of this light could be any form of light source including sunlight.</p>
<p>There are so many things that can cause photophobia, some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive light entering the eyes</li>
<li>Eye infection</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Meningitis</li>
<li>Lack of eye pigment (Albinism)</li>
<li>Wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time, or wearing it wrongly.</li>
<li>Post Eye Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Photophobia usually disappears once the underlying cause is treated. A good way to deal with photophobia is making use of the <strong>Dark Mode </strong>of a mobile device or an application. This helps to reduce the amount of bright light that goes directly into the eyes.</p>
<p>An extension you may consider installing on your desktop browser is &nbsp;<a href="https://nighteye.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Eye</a>. It is supported by almost all major web browsers. It helps you enable <strong>Dark Mode </strong>and other features across almost all the websites you view, to help cope with the light sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, if light sensitivity persists, you may want to see your doctor!<br>
<a name="battery-saver"></a></p>
<h3>5). Battery Saver</h3>
<p>Another positive impact of <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is the impact it has on the battery life of mobile devices. <strong>Dark Mode </strong>can significantly help reduce the battery drain on devices which use OLED(Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg" alt="battery-saver" width="952" height="1393" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg 205w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-699x1024.jpg 699w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-768x1125.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></p>
<p>Numerous studies have confirmed the fact that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> saves battery life. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljafaxRcEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Android Dev Summit</a> in November of 2018, Google also confirmed that themes on android devices have a significant impact on the battery life of a mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device, you should consider using <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, especially at night. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it also helps save your battery life.<br>
<a name="factors-to-consider"></a></p>
<h3>Factors To Consider When Selecting Dark Mode</h3>
<p>In as much as <strong>Dark Mode</strong> seems trendy, it is necessary to consider some factors before deciding to implement it in an application. Some of these factors are discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Readability and Visibility:&nbsp;</strong>Readability simply means the ease at which a reader can easily understand or perceive a written text. Applications that contain lots of text in their interface will have to be careful about how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is implemented.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is not well implemented, this will lead to a poor user experience with the users struggling to read the texts. This defeats one of the purposes for which <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is created and could lead to eye strain.</p>
<p>Lots of research must go into how the backgrounds, text colour and font will work together.</p>
<p><strong>Test Before Implementation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Testing helps to discover the strength and weakness of the Color scheme used in an application. <strong>Dark Mode</strong> does not work well for all applications. A website that contains lots of elements(text, images, tables) may make it difficult for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> to be implemented.</p>
<p>Other factors to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the target audience</li>
<li>Providing an option to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode</li>
<li>The Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to always use <strong>Dark Mode </strong>should always be a relative one. For users of an application, knowing when to use light mode and <strong>Dark Mode </strong>at different times of the day is very essential for the eye.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a very, very long delay, here comes finally another development report about the <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench">BIM tools</a> for <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>. Awfully sorry about the black-out during these last months, lots of things <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_circuit-de-spa-francorchamps-80-millions-d-investissements-et-le-retour-de-la-moto?id=10604892">happened</a> (all the 3D&amp;BIM done with FreeCAD and Blender) and  of course the pandemic didn't ease things either. Anyway, that doesn't mean nothing happened on the FreeCAD front, on the contrary, bugs still get addressed, things get fin-tuned, ideas get discussed, and FreeCAD gets everyday better.</p>
<p>This last month we also had a hectic turnover, because Autodesk changed the terms of the free version of  their <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion360</a>. There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal/hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it's really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to everybody who contributes to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yorikvanhavre">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/yorik/">Liberapay</a> campaigns, I'm really grateful you guys didn't just drop me away when I fail to write for 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, for who didn't notice, FreeCAD now has a proper <a href="https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD/">Liberapay teams account</a> where all money received is divided equally between the FreeCAD developers registered there (currently 7). This account has seen a huge raise of donations these last weeks (it receives around 1000 USD/month at the moment), thanks to the flow of new ex-Fusion360 users, and the impressive job Kunda1 is doing on <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews">the official FreeCAD twitter account</a> (subscribe to it if you are a twitter user, that account used to be just a mirror of the FreeCAD Facebook page, but is now very, very well maintained) and the campaigning of other people (special thanks to my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/beatnikqueen">girlfriend</a>, the most awesome person in the world).</p>
<p>So, no more loitering, to the news! Here is what we got this month:</p>
<h3>Customizable section color</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SetMaterial">Materials</a> now have a new <strong>Section Color</strong> property, which allows to give a different color when the material is viewed and when it is cut through. So for example you can now have your walls appear white when viewed, but black when cut and seen on a TechDraw page.</p>
<p>This is a small improvement so far, but it laid the structure to have more advanced things, such as supporting hatch patterns. The main problem for this, is that, although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/qbrush.html#details">system</a> but it's not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_Module">TechDraw</a>'s implementation of hatch patterns internally recreates OpenCasCade geometry, which works very well but might be heavy for large BIM models. In any case, that's a track I'm <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD/tree/td-makedrawgeomhatch">exploring</a> too.</p>
<h3>Default windows are now openable</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another very small fix, but the default door and windows created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Window">Door and windows tools</a> now have a hinge edge defined, so their <strong>Opening</strong> property now works out-of-the-box. It might not open in the direction you want, though, so you might still need to tweak this. But next items on my list are adding a couple of controls to easily switch opening directions.</p>
<h3>Default pattern size option</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Draft patterns system is now working again (hatch patterns can be added to all closed Draft objects such as rectangles, polylines, circles, etc). I also added a preferences option under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Visual settings</em> to set a default hatch pattern scale, which is useful when you always work with objects of a similar size range, for example building plans. I still have to experiment a bit (0.0025 seems like a very good default setting for BIM), but will add that to the BIM setup screen once I found a couple of good settings.</p>
<h3>Section plane label</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SectionPlane">Section planes</a> now have a <strong>Show Label</strong> property, which, when turned on, show the section plane label on the plane in the 3D view. This is useful to easily identify these section planes when there are many in your document. The text size currently depends on the arrow size, but I'll make all this better customizable later on.</p>
<p>We have further plans too for the section planes, such as be able to double-click or activate them somehow, and find yourself in a separate 2D view with all needed geometry cut or turned off, where you can still work on the model in a 2D environment. This would be a bit like an intermediary step between the full 3D model and a TechDraw view. You can see a first draft of that coded by Carlo Pavan on the experimental tools palette in the BIM workbench.</p>
<h3>TechDraw tools in BIM workbench</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the annotation tools on the BIM workbench, you'll now find two TechDraw tools, <strong>Create page</strong> and <strong>Create view</strong>. The first one is the same of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_PageTemplate">Create page from template</a> TechDraw tool, except that it remembers the last template you used and gets you right there when you use the tool again, so it gives a little bit faster workflow. The second tool is currently the same as the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_ArchView">TechDraw ArchView tool</a> but I plan to make it a bit more flexible in the future so it would become a mix of TechDraw's ArchView and DraftView tools, depending on the selected objects.</p>
<h3>TSV export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Schedule">Schedule</a> tool has been extended to now allow to export results to the .tsv (Tab-Separated Values) format, which is basically the same as the .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format, but using tab characters to separate columns, instead of commas. The big problem of csv, of course, is if there are commas in the columns texts. Usually spreadsheet apps are pretty tolerant with .csv files, they will usually ask you what character to consider as column separator on import, but others (for example GitHub) doesn't display them correctly if they don't use a comma as separator. So from now on there is a correct way to please everybody <i></i></p>
<h3>Blender exporter upgrade</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/yorikvanhavre/029f6fcce9f4d0e62fb6163804b7f80d">FreeCAD exporter for Blender</a> has seen several small fixes, it now automatically adds the .FCStd extension to the generated file if you haven't added it yourself, it now correctly handles object rotation and scaling, and it applies modifiers before exporting. It now also supports faceless objects (wireframe objects).</p>
<p>This coupled with the <a href="https://blenderbim.org/">BlenderBIM</a> improvements, it now becomes increasingly easy to work on BIM models in Blender, or parts of BIM models, and when needed, integrate everything seamlessly in FreeCAD. There are many more joint FreeCAD/Blender developments going on, such as the new <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=51069&amp;p=438881">Sverchok nodes</a> that use FreeCAD internally, literally creating a kind of new interface for FreeCAD withing Blender.</p>
<h3>Detect and suggest development version</h3>
<p>The BIM workbench will now detect your FreeCAD version on the setup screen, and suggest you to install a development version if you are not using one. This will help people to be aware of the existence of development versions, and become more used to them and how to install and mange them.</p>
<h3>Grid extension setting in Working Plane panel</h3>
<p>The overall size of the grid is now settable directly from the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_SelectPlane">Working Plane</a> task panel.</p>
<h3>Multiple custom folders on start page</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Start_Workbench">start page</a> can now show multiple custom folders. To achieve that, go to the start page preferences under menu <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Start</em> and instead of choosing one custom folder, type manually several folder paths, separated by ;;</p>
<p>For example: <code>/home/yorik;;/home/yorik/Examples;;/home/yorik/FreeCAD/Examples</code></p>
<h3>Image Plane scaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_Scale">Draft Scale</a> tool now support image planes created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Module">Image workbench</a>. So it is now easy to import reference images such as scanned floor plans, position them on a common reference point, and scale them to the desired size.</p>
<h3>Unit and Show Unit in Draft dimension preferences</h3>
<p>You can now set default value for these two settings under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Dimensions and Texts</em>, that will affect all newly created dimensions.</p>
<h3>Manual upgrade</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I started upgrading the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual">manual</a> to FreeCAD 0.19, and this time I intend well to produce a printed book with it. To be continued!</p>
<p>That's it for this month I guess, I promise to do everything I can to resume posting once per month!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Yorik</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1978 Japan's <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81">Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry</a>
established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still
serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the
JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the
added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant
or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These
are what came to be known as the ghost characters
(<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97">幽霊文字</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/ghostcanvas.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/ghostcanvas.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>Be careful what you write. <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1312837">via the NDL</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly
forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover
where they had come from.  While all characters in the JIS standard were
supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it
wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.</p>
<p>You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the
characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a "source" - one
of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the "Overview of
National Administrative Districts" (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of
place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind
of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the
<a href="http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html">latest edition</a> is a seven volume set
with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a
single character without a page reference.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was
successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the
catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators
established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the
cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to
record "山 over 女". "山 over 女" occurs in the name of a particular place and
was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't
print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and
pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line
where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to
the character by mistake. The original character
(<a href="https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4">𡚴</a>) was not added to JIS or
Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical
precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a
misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific incident was uncovered.</p>
<p>Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made
their way into Unicode, which has its own <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97">separate set of ghost
characters</a>
introduced during CJK unification.</p>
<p>To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of
nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and
now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the
planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.</p>
<p>At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ</p>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

<p>Both the C and Free Pascal implementations as well as WinLIL
are licensed under the zlib license below:</p>

<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>
