<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a “systems” person.</p>
<p>It’s not like I never tried - making schedules, using a Pomodoro timer,&lt;insert productivity “hack”&gt; - they didn’t work because I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104540572-bb4c3d00-5645-11eb-86f9-de27e6b8d07d.jpg" alt="square_peg.jpg"> <small> <a href="https://baddadcartoons101.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/square-peg-and-a-round-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Source: BadDadCartoons </i> </a> </small> </p>
<p>What I ended up doing was instead of focusing on optimising the time I spent productively - i.e. the “deep work” part (which happened rather spontaneously independent of whether I’m on a productivity hack or not) - I decided to focus on the time that was not “deep work” i.e. time spent on ‘distractions’ or entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time in a day on Instagram where the feed was mostly filled with memes. I also used Quora/Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>Consuming content is easy. Like junk food. It's almost embedded in our reflexes.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing - you can easily turn your distractions to things that can benefit you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Start with cutting off distractions that have too much noise i.e. do not give you a good return of investment on your time in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific knowledge/skills</li>
<li>Specific insight</li>
<li>Accessing and leveraging a network</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ones that remain, optimise the shit out of them.</p>
<p>For me, that meant Instagram was instantly off the list. Twitter and Quora were okay, but I had a long way to go.</p>
<br>
<h3> Optimising your feed </h3>
<p>Social media “feed”.
What comes to your mind when you think of the word - “feed”?</p>
<p>This comes to my mind when I think “feed”</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541024-c0f65280-5646-11eb-92f6-de5227d4b8a1.png" alt="sheep.jpg"> <i> <small> Sheep, “feed”ing </small>
</i> </p>
<p>Our minds are literally “fed” content.</p>
<p>“We are what we eat” - this doesn’t just stand for physical, tangible food - it applies to the digital content we feed our mind with.</p>
<p>I want you to take this literally because we take our attention for granted. In a digital economy run by monetising attention - it will naturally be full of noise.</p>
<p>Most of the content we read or watch is optimised solely for capturing our attention and clicks. More times than not, you don’t need something that is being shown to you. You will be perfectly fine without knowing it existed. Yep, sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say social media is bad. Social media is an amplifier of all there is - of both the good stuff and the bad. It is an amplifier of your primal instincts so if you don’t proactively weed out the bad stuff from your feed regularly, you are going to get sick. Really sick.</p>
<p>What that means is, with some conscious effort you can filter out your feed to keep only the things that benefit you. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t follow brands. Follow people.</p>
<p>I’ll bring the sheep here, again.</p>
<p>When I imagine a brand account, I imagine the shepherd.</p>
<p>And all of the 100-200-500k followers as the sheep.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541200-1599cd80-5647-11eb-8d7f-f89ae517eb81.png" alt="shepherd.jpg"></p><p>The only reason brand accounts exist is to convince you - in obvious or non-obvious ways - that you need their product in some way or the other. 99-100% of brand accounts posts are pure marketing. You do not need them.
It’s like bombarding your own feed with their ads - full time - <em>with your full consent</em>. Especially so if you are already consuming a brand’s product. Why?!</p>
<p>Who should you follow then?</p>
<p>Follow people. Now, you might argue that people themselves can be brands and you are absolutely right - avoid them too. This goes for popular celebrities, sportspeople, singers etc.
Around half the time, you are probably going to see marketing stuff from them as well. Not all are like that of course, apply your judgement. I respect a lot of celebrities but I don’t follow them because I simply don’t need their opinion in my feed - I couldn’t care any less - they are artists, I liked their art, I liked how they performed but that doesn’t mean I like their opinion nor do I need to listen to them on every single issue there is. At the end of the day, including every celebrity or band or anything in your feed just increases the “distraction” score in your feed.</p>
<p>Okay. Brands are out. Brand people are out. What next?</p>
<p>Follow thinkers. Follow do-ers. Follow people who are creating something.</p>
<p>Some follows I would recommend in no particular order:
<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @naval </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @nntaleb </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @JamesClear </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

<a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @David_Perell </a>,</p>
<p>This is a subjective list, of course, but the idea remains the same: when you scroll - scroll to think, not to react. The posts/tweets in your feed should stop and make you think. If they enable <em>only</em> a reaction like rage or anxiety - remove it.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A simple heuristic to clean your social media feed:</p><p>Scroll to think, not to react</p><p>Reduce content that enables only a reaction. <br>Increase content that stops and makes you think.</p></div>— Akhil (@akhlkg) <a href="https://twitter.com/akhlkg/status/1346891698861862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>
<p>When something is trending and it doesn’t really matter to you much, mute all the words/hashtags/etc related to it. The “Explore” section in Twitter is a black hole of distractions. Twitter will try to shove you up with random stuff all the time in your feed - but mute/block/ignore them all - this takes conscious effort but is well worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541285-5691e200-5647-11eb-93d6-ed60a6cfa293.png" alt="twet.jpg"></p><p>If it's a trending event you do genuinely care about and you must “react” to it - here’s my two step strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore ‘the first wave’</strong></p>
<p>The first wave is the most emotional one. The purpose of the first wave, knowingly or unknowingly, is to polarise. There is no place for rationality in the first wave of posts, trends, articles, etc. You are likely going to see the same type/flavour of content - over and over from all sorts of people which essentially just convey the same thing in different shades of rage. There is nothing against the stream, yet. Mute ‘em all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Once the first wave is gone and the hashtags die, start looking around. This can be anywhere from 1 week to several months depending on the issue. You are searching for truth, so don’t look at the news - if you’re reading articles online, don’t just look at one publisher, read on the same article by different publishers. Remember, each publishing house has a “flavour” of twisting things. An easy way to cancel the bias out is to read from many publishers and see what remains common. Now analyse the common facts - those are the fundamental facts that supposedly happened and anything above that, is just an opinion.</p>
<p>You can also look if the “thinkers” are reacting. If so, see what they are saying.
It takes effort to get to the truth and navigate through the noise, so I don’t end up doing this a lot of times because I simply didn't care about the event as much as I thought. And it looks like I end up doing okay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>That’s about it. In theory, you can apply these principles to any social media platform. I tested and developed these on Twitter but the fundamental idea remains the same: <strong>scroll to think, not to react.</strong></p>
<p>And this fundamental idea helped me a lot. Twitter taught me a lot of things that form a core part of who I am now - staying healthy, strength training, mental models, entrepreneurship, making money online, writing.</p>
<p>You can use your distractions to literally change your life - and I really hope you do!</p></div></div>]]>

Many universities agree on the answer: “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Although anthropologists and archeologists still wonder why human beings have for so long organized themselves to fight, the study of war in history and political science departments is fading. Senior scholars are retiring and not being replaced, or their posts are allocated to other fields of history. Each year, fewer courses are offered on great conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the total wars of the 20th century, and the Cold War. The Second World War, you may hear on campus, “has been done.”</p><p>Yet war remains one of the events—along with revolution, famine, financial collapse and, as we are learning again, pandemics—that change the course of history. In privileged countries, we forget the importance of military conflicts because we have enjoyed the “Long Peace” that followed the Second World War. Other places have not been so fortunate, with wars around the world almost every year since 1945, bringing millions of deaths and creating millions more refugees. Meanwhile, the world’s great powers maintain large military establishments, and still prepare for battle. </p><p>It is as important as ever to understand war—its causes, nature and consequences—and the many ways that conflicts have shaped our societies. The conquering armies that came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century after the Prophet Mohammad’s death created new empires and spread the new religion of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict, laid the foundations for the dominance of the British Empire and the bankruptcy of France, which helped to fuel the French Revolution.&nbsp; </p><p>War can also speed up advances in science and technology that have benefits in peacetime. Think of the development of penicillin, blood transfusions, radar, or the transistor. And war can bring about significant social change, often for the better. The need for mass armies in the 19th and 20th centuries meant that governments had to treat the lower classes better, whether by educating them or by improving public health. In many countries that fought in the two world wars, ruling classes recognized the contributions of women and the working classes, granting them the franchise and introducing social benefits. </p><p>So why do history faculties, which accept the need to study other great forces in history, such as changes in the means of production or systems of belief, shy from war? I suspect that horror at the phenomenon itself has affected universities’ willingness to treat it as a subject for scholarship. Years ago, when I proposed a new course on war and society, an education consultant asked me, “Why don’t you call it peace studies?” </p><p>I have since met with incomprehension, even hostility, when I have pointed out that wars can bring unintended benefits. However much I say that we would not <em>choose</em> to make war in order to improve our societies, I am charged with loving war. Yet nobody would say that the study of imperialism, racism or famine means that we think those are good things.</p><p><strong>The history of war is neglected for other reasons, too. </strong>First, separate histories—of women, emotions, food and the environment, for example—have come along. Quite rightly, room has been made for them in the big and eclectic house that is the study of the past. However, part of the shift away from war studies owes to the quest for “social justice”—intended as a drive for radical change in society at large—that has taken root in many history faculties. </p><p>Here, for example, is how the chair of Historical and Cultural Studies at the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, Natalie Rothman, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/">welcomed students</a> this autumn: “As a department, we have strengthened our resolve to confront racism, colonialism and Islamophobia throughout our curriculum and in our co-curricular initiatives.” The University of Berkeley in California <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">asks prospective graduate students</a> to provide “evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups.” It is hard to quarrel with such goals, but their impact on curriculum has been to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/why-did-we-stop-teaching-political-history.html?smid=em-share">downgrade subjects such as political and military history,</a> which are seen as too focused on elites and complicit with hierarchy and oppression. </p><p>Another factor is that history overall is worryingly in decline as an academic subject. While it remains popular among publishers and readers, enrollments in history majors are significantly down. They have <a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report">dropped more than any other major</a> in the humanities—perhaps by as much as <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-students-ditching-the-history-major">one-third</a> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/27/new-analysis-history-major-data-says-field-new-low-can-it-be-saved">American universities</a> in the past decade. At the University of Toronto, where I am a professor, colleagues fear that history enrollment may be down as much as 50% over the same period. Even in the United Kingdom, where history remains popular among undergraduates, the number of those majoring in history has dropped by about <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain">one-tenth</a> in the past decade. </p><p>Part of the reason is that, given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and uncertainty over the economy, students and their parents want university courses to lead to jobs. The decline in history students in turn affects university hiring, and the fewer the tenured faculty, the fewer places for the doctoral students who are the future of the profession.&nbsp; </p><p>Faculties and administrators are not necessarily helping matters, reluctant to include popular courses on war in the curriculum, or to support well-established centers for the study of conflict, some of which are being remodeled, such as the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, in Waterloo, Ontario, which will focus more on Canadian history; another at the University of Calgary is fading as those who retire are not replaced. This seems to be particularly true of elite universities. War studies remains in better health at military colleges or some second-tier public universities, while schools of public policy are also still teaching military history, strategic studies and diplomatic history. </p><p>But those in other fields stereotype war studies, characterizing it as too narrowly focused on tactics, battles, or “toys for boys,” meaning armaments. If that caricature were ever true, it has not been for decades. The great historian Sir Michael Howard, who pioneered the modern study of war and trained generations of historians, always insisted that what he was doing was to consider wars within their social and political contexts as a part of the great sweep of history, not somehow separate from it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>My own evidence of the distaste for military and diplomatic history </strong>at North American universities comes from tales exchanged privately among fellow academics. One retired Canadian military historian recounted that his old faculty had asked him how to reverse the collapse in enrollment. He suggested a course in military history, but the response was a flat no. When a university in the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada was offered a fully funded post in naval history a few years ago—a good fit in a port town that had been deeply affected by conflict on the Atlantic—members of the department rejected it. </p><p>Yet, despite the overall downturn in university history programs, we know from course enrollments that students are interested in war, as indeed they are in international relations, when they get the chance to study them: At Yale, Paul Kennedy’s “Military History of the West” attracted large crowds; at Toronto’s Ryerson University, international relations courses are the most popular choices among students.</p><p>I would not suggest that student preference should determine what departments offer. But they should at least be listened to. Much more important is what we, as societies, want our future leaders to know. Political history, diplomatic history and the study of war—they all offer critical warnings and instructive analogies to our times. Social and cultural histories, and history from the bottom up, add to our understanding too. But we need balance, and a sense of how the micro- and macro-histories mesh with each other. </p><p>Do we really want citizens who have so little knowledge of how war helped to shape our values and societies and our world? Do we ever want another president asking, as Donald Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pearl-harbor-memorial-tour-john-kelly-stable-genius-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">did</a> during a visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial: “What’s this all about? What’s this a tour of?” </p><p>If we aren’t aware of how wars happen, we may fail to recognize warning signs when the next conflict brews, as it will. </p><p><strong>Margaret MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor at the University of Oxford. Her latest book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609692/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan/">War: How Conflict Shaped Us</a></strong></em><strong>, was among the </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> 10 Best Books of 2020. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve got a new Apple laptop, so I thought I’d do an Emacs build benchmark.  Building Emacs is what people do on computers, right?  At least if I extrapolate from myself, which is the only natural thing to do.</p>
<p>It’s called proof by induction.  Look it up, nerds.</p>
<p>So here’s the benchmarks:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>2m14s</td>
<td>7m31</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>6m22s</td>
<td>15m22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>7m13s</td>
<td>12m33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>2m44s</td>
<td>6m37s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The next-to-last column is with -jTO-THE-MAX, and the last column is with -j1.</p>
<p>I’m impressed!  The M1 is able to build Emacs almost as fast as my AMD machine…  which is a lot bigger.</p>
<p>Of course, on Debian I’m using gcc and on Macos I’m using clang, so it’s an apples-to-some-different-brand-of-apples comparison.</p>
<p>It’s even more impressive how much faster this laptop is compared to the Apple laptop from…  2019?  Yeah.  It’s more than twice as fast!  And doesn’t have a fan!  The old Apple laptop would sound like a VAX in a hurricane while building Emacs!</p>
<p>And it’s also twice as fast as the laptop I use daily here on the couch; last year’s Lenovo Carbon X1, which is just embarrassing.  Lenovo!  Get on it!  Make an ARM laptop that’s fast!</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have Apple envy.  That is, for the first time ever, they’ve made a laptop that’s clearly superior to what’s available for us Linux peeps.  My only comfort is that the Apple keyboard still sucks.  Yeah!  And it doesn’t have a TrackPoint!  Yeah!  My laptop is still the best!  Yeah!  Take that!</p>
<p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="558" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-300x199.jpg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-768x511.jpg 768w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC02170-2048x1362.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p>
<p>Yeah!  I’m not the least envious!</p>
<p>*sniff*</p>
<p>Edit some hours later:</p>
<p>But one thing that would be interesting to look at is Emacs performance on M1 vs the other machines.  And a way to broadly look at that is to see how long it takes to byte-compile a bunch of Emacs Lisp files: This exercises much of Emacs, except display-related stuff.</p>
<p>So:  Benchmarking with</p>
<pre>rm `find lisp -name '*.elc'`; time make -jMAX</pre>
<p>I get:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>My Main Build Machine</td>
<td>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X (8 Core/16 Threads)</td>
<td>0m57s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Lenovo Carbon X1 Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10610U CPU (4 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>4m13s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My Old Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU (2 Core/4 Threads)</td>
<td>5m33s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My New M1 Apple Laptop</td>
<td>Apple M1 (4-to-8-ish Cores)</td>
<td>1m33s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Here the AMD clearly wins over the ARM, but per-core performance is in advantage of the ARM.  And, of course, the ARM soundly wins over both of the other two laptops.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="post-1749"><div><p>Let me share a short story. I used to hate doing squats at the gym. I would make good progress in every strength-training exercise except for the squat. My posture felt wrong, I had a hard time coordinating my movements, and my numbers would never improve. It was embarrassing, really. I ended up thinking of doing squats as something complicated, frustrating, and potentially dangerous; something I was better off avoiding altogether.</p><p>How do I feel about doing squats now? It’s become my #1 favorite strength-training exercise. Who changed my mind? A great personal trainer I met a few years ago who still trains me to this day. He taught me the right technique, helped me strengthen my weak spots while keeping the entire process challenging and motivating. He completely changed my perspective on squats. Now, I think they’re fun!</p><p>I have met many students over the years who saw negotiation just like I used to see squats: something hard and risky, something to avoid. Most people&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to negotiate because they know that it’s the only way to obtain desirable outcomes. Their issue is they haven’t acquired the knowledge and developed the right skills to negotiate well enough yet to obtain these outcomes.</p><p>My goal is to help you acquire these skills. My approach to negotiation training is based on three tenets.</p><h3><strong>You can’t get stronger unless you learn the proper technique</strong></h3><p>A lot of people who claim to be great negotiators often mean that they are great at haggling. When people haggle, all they do is make price concessions until the other party agrees. It’s not hard, and it’s something you can learn quickly by mimicking others. Negotiation is a complex process designed to increase value and resolve conflicts. There are many ways one can screw up a negotiation.</p><p>To be a good negotiator, you need to know how to make the right decisions. Nobody was born knowing how to prepare for a negotiation, how to craft a first offer, or how to deal with negotiators who lie; these are learnt behaviors. Sure, you could rely on your intuition and figure things out on your own, but why would you try to reinvent the wheel when we already have established methods available?</p><p>For this reason, my next few emails will focus on proven methods and techniques to help you approach the main steps of a negotiation.</p><h3><strong>You can’t excel at everything, but you can mitigate your risks</strong></h3><p>Negotiation mobilizes so many different cognitive and interpersonal skills that it would be unreasonable to expect excelling at all of them. Nobody is THAT good. Negotiating is a stress test on your entire system, which means that you are only as strong as your weakest element.</p><p>Maybe you are too focused on making your counterpart happy, and you often leave the negotiation table having regrets about your own outcome. Maybe you have the opposite problem and you only see a negotiation as successful if you completely crush the other party. Now, nobody wants to negotiate with you anymore. It could be many things, but there are usual suspects and there are ways to deal with them.</p><p>You can’t completely fix your weaknesses, but you can use strategies to work around them. This will be the second phase of our negotiation training.</p><h3><strong>Becoming a good negotiator is a long-term commitment</strong></h3><p>Just like everything in life that has to do with human performance, negotiation training strictly follows the law of diminishing returns. This comes with good news and bad news.</p><p>The good news is that if you apply yourself to improving your negotiation skills, you will make progress very quickly in the beginning. This is a phase that people often find exhilarating because they feel like they have finally unlocked their potential.</p><p>The bad news is that the further you go in your negotiation training, the harder it will be for you to make new gains. You won’t be able to get by just by following basic rules anymore; it will be time to refine your skills. You will need to be exposed to increasingly complex negotiation situations, with incentives to keep you engaged and motivated throughout the process.</p><p>For this reason, my plan is to maintain this newsletter in the long-term, with fresh perspectives and different opportunities to engage.</p><h2>Do You Want to Improve Your Negotiation Skills?</h2><p>Sign-up using the form below.

										Why I’ve Changed My Mind on Bitcoin									</a>

									<p><i><span>I highly suggest consuming the full piece </span></i><a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-ive-changed-my-mind-on-bitcoin/"><i><span>here</span></i></a><span> (</span><i><span>7 min. read time</span></i><span>)</span></p>
<p><span>“As Paulo Coelho wrote in </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=K3Q9uLgqQp&amp;rank=1"><i><span>The Alchemist</span></i></a><span>: Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time,” Nick references.</span></p>
<p><span>“What the Bitcoin bulls were right about was increased adoption and the ability of many Bitcoin owners to hold (‘</span><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hodl"><span>HODL</span></a><span>’) even as prices rose dramatically. These two effects (more demand from buyers and reduced supply from sellers) have helped to boost Bitcoin’s price and cement it as a legitimate asset class within the investment community.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>People who were skeptical of Bitcoin before its recent price surge, told themselves that they’d buy Bitcoin if it dropped to the $1,000-$2,000 range. This range keeps going up for the skeptics. “…every time the price goes up in the future, these ‘mental buy limits’ go up as well, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin’s future survival,” Nick explains.</span></p>
<p><span>“…both the price of gold and the price Bitcoin are based around one thing and one thing alone—belief. The belief that these assets will have value in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>Nick compares Bitcoin to the early years of the ability to invest in gold. “Though Bitcoin is unlikely to follow a similar path to gold, it is likely to exhibit similar behavior. This means that Bitcoin will continue to have huge run ups in price followed by violent crashes. Crashes that may last years (and possibly decades) in the future.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
<p><span>“…if Bitcoin’s market capitalization were to match that of gold, it would be worth over $500,000 a coin. This is why some investors are so bullish on Bitcoin.” — Nick Maggiulli</span></p>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: That last fact is pretty mind-blowing. As an investor, the question becomes will Bitcoin ever reach the same market capitalization as gold? Nobody knows the answer to that question, but choosing to invest in Bitcoin means you’re willing to find out. I’m willing to find out. Albeit, I barely put any money in, although many people don’t realize you don’t have to buy 1 whole Bitcoin to invest. You’re able to buy $100 worth or whatever amount you’re comfortable with and still “own Bitcoin.” You’d just be a partial owner alongside tons of other partial owners. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete the President.</strong> Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/07/us/capitol-building-trump">after a violent riot at the capital</a>, Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html">erased the President of the United States from social media</a>. He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

      <h4 id="brad-joins-a-startup">Brad joins a startup</h4>
<p>When I first joined <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> almost a year
ago, one of the first things I asked
<a href="https://github.com/crawshaw">Crawshaw</a> was, “So, what database do you
use? MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite maybe?”, knowing that he loved SQLite.</p>
<p>“A text file," he replied.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we write out one big JSON object to a text file.”</p>
<p>“How? When? <em>What?</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, whenever something changes, we grab a lock in our single
process and rewrite out the file!” he chuckled with glee.</p>
<p>It sounded insane. It <em>was</em> insane. Sure, it was easily testable, but
it didn’t scale. We both knew that. But it worked.</p>
<p>Until it didn’t.</p>
<p>Even with fast NVMe drives and splitting the database into two halves
(important data vs. ephemeral data that we could lose on a tmpfs),
things got slower and slower. We knew the day would come. The file
reached a peak size of 150MB and we were writing it as quickly as the
disk I/O would let us. Ain’t that just peachy?</p>
<p>So, migrate to MySQL or PostgreSQL, right? Maybe SQLite?</p>
<p>Nope, Crawshaw had other ideas.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-backstory-from-david">A bit of backstory from David</h4>
<p>Tailscale’s coordination server, our “control plane”, has become known
as <a href="https://getsmart.fandom.com/wiki/CONTROL">CONTROL</a>. It’s currently
a single Go process on a single VM. The very earliest prototypes for
CONTROL used SQLite. Our original designs were very different from
what we ended up with, involving configuration databases synchronized
onto client machines and all sorts of other concepts we ended up not
needing. Through this process we would do major reorganizations of our
SQL data model every week, which required an astonishing amount of
typing. SQL is widely used, durable, effective, and requires an
annoying amount of glue to bring into just about any programming
language. (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an
annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of
efficiency.)</p>
<p>One day, fed up with the refactorings, I threw it all out and built an
in-memory data model for experimentation. That made iterating
much faster. A couple of weeks later, a customer wanted to try it
out. I wasn’t ready to commit to the data model yet and do it properly
in SQL, so I took a shortcut: the object holding all the data was
wrapped in a <code>sync.Mutex</code>, all accesses went through it, and on edit the
whole structure was passed to <code>json.Marshal</code> and written to disk. This
gave us data model persistence in ~20 lines of Go.</p>
<p>The plan was always to migrate to something else but, uh, we got busy
with other stuff and kinda forgot.</p>
<h4 id="what-comes-after-jsonmutexdb">What comes after JSONMutexDB?</h4>
<p>The obvious next step to take was to move to SQL. My favorite is still
SQLite, but I couldn’t bring myself to make an argument for migrating
a rapidly growing service to it. It certainly could work, especially
as the design of our control plane doesn’t require the high
availability of typical web services: the result of a short outage is
that new nodes can’t log in; working networks continue to work.</p>
<p>MySQL (or PostgreSQL) would come next. I’m not particularly familiar
with anything MySQL post 1998, but I’m sure it would work. The HA
story for open source databases is somewhat surprising, though: you
can either have traditional lagging replicas, or commit to
no-primary-replica clusters that have very surprising transaction
semantics. I wasn’t excited about trying to design a stable API or
good network graph calculations on top of those semantics.
<a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach#what-is-cockroachdb">CockroachDB</a>
looked very promising, and indeed still does! But it’s relatively new
for a database and I was a little concerned about getting attached to
features in a fresh DBMS that would be hard to migrate away from if we
needed to.</p>
<p>Making our control server depend on MySQL or PostgreSQL also means our
control server’s testing story gets slow &amp; ugly. Brad had fought that
battle with <a href="https://perkeep.org/">Perkeep</a> and previously written
<a href="https://godoc.org/perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest">perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest</a>
which works but isn’t something we wanted to subject future employees
to. It requires Docker on your machine and it’s not particularly fast.</p>
<p>Then one day we saw a <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/etcd-3.4.3">Jepsen report on
etcd</a>. Unlike the usual
less-than-satisfying Jepsen reports to which we’d become accustomed,
this one said <em>good things</em> about <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.
Combined with some positive experiences <a href="https://github.com/danderson">Dave Anderson</a>
had with it, we started thinking about whether we could just use etcd directly.
Being written in Go, we could just link it into our tests and use it
directly. No Docker, no mocks, testing what we’d actually use in
production.</p>
<p>It turned out that the core data model we were writing to disk closely
followed the pattern:</p>
<pre><code>type AllTheData struct {
	BigLock    sync.Mutex
	Somethings map[string]Something
	Widgets    map[string]Widget
	Gadgets    map[string]Gadget
}
</code></pre><p>This maps surprisingly well onto a KV-store. So this led us to etcd as
a “minimally-viable database”. It does the critical things we needed
now, which was 1) breaking the BigLock into something more akin to a
<code>sync.RWMutex</code>, and 2) reducing our I/O to only write the changed data,
not the whole world on any write.</p>
<p>(We are careful not to use any etcd features that would be hard to map onto CockroachDB.)</p>
<p>The downside of this is that etcd, while popular in Kubernetes, has
relatively few users for a database system. As a company, Tailscale is
spending an <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation
token</a> on it. But the
database is conceptually small enough that we don’t have to treat it
as a black box. When we ran into a surprisingly slow key pagination
edge case in etcd 3.4, I was able to read my way through its sources
and write a fix for it in an hour. (I then discovered an <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/26c930f27d46776da5fedae69267ba0b69c31185">equivalent
fix</a>
had already been applied to the next version of etcd, so we backported
that instead.)</p>
<h4 id="tailetc-our-etcd-client-wrapper">tailetc: our etcd client wrapper</h4>
<p>The client we use for etcd is open source at
<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc">github.com/tailscale/tailetc</a>. It
is built around two concepts: 1) the total data in the DB is small
enough to fit into the server’s memory and 2) reads are far more
common than writes. Given that, we want to make reads cheap.</p>
<p>The way we do that is by registering a watch against etcd. Every
change is sent to the client, which maintains an enormous cache
<code>map[string]interface{}</code> behind a <code>sync.RWMutex</code>. When you create a Tx
and do a Get, the value is read out of this cache (which may be behind
etcd, but is kept transactionally consistent by tracking the modrev: a
global incrementing ID that etcd uses to define revisions of key-value
pairs.). To avoid aliasing bugs with the cache, we copy the object
out, but avoid JSON decoding on each Get by implementing a more
efficient Clone call on objects in the cache.</p>
<p>The result is that fetching a value from etcd does not require any
network traffic.</p>
<p>This is one of those few times writing Go that I felt the limitations
of its type system as I was designing a package. If I were working in
a language with all the bells and whistles, there would be some kind
of const qualifier I could place on objects leaving the cache and
avoid cloning the memory. That said, running profiles on our server
show the copying is not a performance issue, so perhaps this is an
example of where I feel the pull towards a more complex type system
without actually having a real need for them. As is so often the case,
assumptions are dangerous, profiling is enlightening.</p>
<h4 id="one-snag-indexes">One snag: indexes</h4>
<p>The biggest problem with choosing a minimal viable “nosql” is the lack
of the wonderful index system every standard SQL DBMS supplies. We are
stuck with either storing indexes inside etcd, or managing them in
memory in our client.</p>
<p>With JSONMutexDB we generated them in memory, because it’s much easier
to make data model changes. The easy option with etcd would have been
writing them to the database, but that would have really complicated
data models. Unfortunately, if we want to move to running more than
one CONTROL process simultaneously for high-availability and better
release management, that means we no longer have exactly one process
managing the data, so our indexes need to be transaction (and
rollback) aware. So we invested what probably amounts to two or three
weeks of engineering time into designing in-memory indexes that are
transactionally consistent. This gets a bit tricky to describe, so
we’ll save that for a future blog post (and hopefully we can clean up
the code enough to open source it some day).</p>
<h4 id="the-migration">The migration</h4>
<p>The migration wasn’t very notable, which is always a good thing. We
ran both systems in parallel for a while and at some point stopped
using the old one. The most exciting thing was that our commit latency
dropped a bunch when we turned off the JSON writes. This was most
noticeable when editing networks in the admin panel. We’d include
pretty Grafana graphs here but the cut-over predates us changing our
Prometheus config to keep more history. In any case, writes went from
nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds. When we’d started,
writes weren’t a second of course. Never underestimate how long your
“temporary” hack will stay in production!</p>
<h4 id="future">Future</h4>
<p>The most exciting thing about this work, besides ensuring the
Tailscale control plane can scale out for the foreseeable future, is
improving our release process. A consistent database we can easily
attach multiple control plane instances to means we can move to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>.
This will let Tailscale engineers experiment with deploying features
with the confidence that the worst-case outcome of a change is
limited. The goal is to keep development speed as close to the early
days of JSONMutexDB, when you could recompile and run locally in a
fraction of a second and deploy ten times a day.</p>

<h2>Ten years without Elixir</h2>
<p>José Valim committed the first bit of Elixir code January
9th, 2011, which marks a ten-year anniversary for the kid
brother of Erlang. It’s incredible how time flies on 
certain paradigms, while crawls on others.</p>

<p>I never got into Elixir, largely because it looked like
Ruby. I was a Rubyist for a good while, spent time
and effort to learn where to park my commas, semicolons,
and periods in Erlang, so I never felt that Elixir was
something I wanted.</p>

<p>Nor have I since. There was a good web framework that
came along, and since I’m of that age, you’d thing that
Phoenix would have pulled me in: it never did. I kept
hacking Erlang and just used lighter web <abbr>API</abbr>s like
Cowboy &amp; Elli, instead of going all in on a full
fledged web framework.</p>

<p>From my Erlang-colored glasses, Elixir seems to have
a lot of wins. Their packaging efforts looks like a
mature tool (Hex), and nobody seems to be complaining
about the documentation, an issue Erlang always had (though
to be honest, I never quite grasped what aspect of the
Erlang documentation to be problematic).</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the syntax Elixir offers
is retrograde, in my humble opinion. Erlang seems to
have prettier syntax now that I have spent so much
time with it. A moot point, perhaps, considering how
subjective beauty is.</p>

<p>My strongest anti-Elixir sentiment (from armchair
reach) is their use of pipes. I know mixologists love
the Elixir pipe operator, but for someone who has
learned to necessarily un-nest code as severely as I have, I
feel as though this operator could be a detriment, or
at least come with some prickily moral hazards. More on that
can be read 
<a href="http://blog.cretaria.com/posts/erlang-beauty.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Elixir is a cool project, and managed to out-pace Erlang
in a lot of areas it struggled (community,
tooling, etc.).</p>

<p>Hats off to the Elixir team on ten enormous years of
success!</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

Hours later, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">Twitter banned Donald Trump</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">a broader group of major internet companies</a> did the same. Then, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">Amazon brought the Ban Hammer down on Parler</a>, the hate reactor built by hapless fall guy John Matze and heiress Rebekah Mercer.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol#:~:text=The%20storming%20of%20the%20United,in%20the%202020%20presidential%20election.">excellent justifications for why this was necessary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348310439331995650">why this emergent coordination occurred</a> and why was necessary. I don’t want to talk about them. What matters more for me right now? <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374694320250881">I don’t think it will ever work again</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374695452708864">A trans-national economy of people building censorship-resistant technology seems to have a new occasion for war</a>. The fire next time won’t be containable in similar ways.</p>

<p>This leads me to a simple conclusion: <strong>if you care about making social mediums work better in the future, your solutions must assume censorship resistance as a given</strong>. Otherwise, <a href="https://twitter.com/generativist/status/1348374705766498304">your building on an already-pruned branch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-our-augmented-space">Engineering Our Augmented Space</h2><p>Centralized social media – as it exists today – is Procrustean. On Twitter, <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/the-real-supernode-problem">super-nodes excessively synchronize attention in mal-adaptive ways</a>. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">The weight of identity-to-context skews far enough towards the former that we’re prone to chronically ignoring or failing to consider the latter</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">Social beefs end proliferate in wild abundance</a>. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/15/crowds-and-technology/">Crowds grow, swarm, and disassociate from reality</a>. All of this is all great for farming freely-offered attention. But, a good cybernetic ecosystem it does not make.</p>

<p>Given it’s defacto-albeit-not-really role as the world’s hyperspace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere">public sphere</a>, a great deal of (recent) attention seems to be on making a censorship-resistant Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1348415859707023362">This is a mistake</a> borne of the DWeb/Blockchain communities’ ideological defaults.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship resistance <em>may be</em> necessary for solving some of these problems. But, it’s desperately far from sufficient.</strong> Missing is the attention dedicated to creating a social environment that fits us, not one that demands we fit it. It requires considering that – while there are a variety of technological architectures for creating a distributed and decentralized social medium – not all of them are sociological solutions.</p>
<p>I am interested in finding a solution at the intersection of both problems.</p>

<p>What follows is a small projection of my view from 10,000 feet.</p>
<h3 id="1-ephemeral-by-default">1. Ephemeral By Default</h3><p>Blockchains ensure immutability. Robust consensus mechanisms afford canonical state. Both can be useful. But the latter is computationally costly. More than that, there is an expense borne by <em>the forms of expression it selects for</em>.</p>

<p>In the context of ephemeral mediums, it’s excessively restrictive. <strong>Not every statement requires non-repudiation; in social contexts, very few do.</strong><label for="sn-0"></label><span>I’m bending what non-repudiation means a bit here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">Right to be forgetten</a> is almost closer. Except, you can’t forget on a global immutable ledger…by definition. Ephemeral by default albeit with cryptographic signing for message authentication means what you socially reveal is <em>more</em> in your control, and fosters better norms.</span> If every utterance persists forever, people either self-censor or <em>excessively</em> fracture their identity into disposable fragments, as a defense.<label for="sn-1"></label><span><a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balaijis</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Dur918GqDIw">gives a talk worth listening to about pseudonymous economy</a> that proposes the use of cryptographic attestations to imbue alts with some of main’s properties, in a precise information theoretic way. He sees it as a way to manage social capital risks as any other capital asset. The talk is fascinating, but I think it’s solving the wrong problem.</span> Both behaviors frustrate social processes – including those of consensus formation.</p>

<p>The need to <em>optionally</em> commit a statement to a ledger in contexts where non-repudiation is desirable exists, as does the need.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>For example, if you are following someone whose reputation is derived from making accurate predictions about the future, <a href="http://www.investorhome.com/scam.htm">you want their full history, not the selectively trimmed version</a>. Global and immutable state makes such scams more difficult. <em>But</em>, my contention is that, making it impossible is too socially costly. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913819508443369">Expressive behavior exists</a> and instrumentality is a dead end.</span> But it is not a good default. The temporal context of most expressions is now. Carrying prior utterances – generally without context – forward, creates conditions for maladaptive hysteresis. The past binds longer than it need to, in ways that don’t reflect the present – and, in doing so, it limits the future.</p>
<h3 id="2-peer-to-peer-by-necessity">2. Peer-to-peer by Necessity</h3><p>On the technological side, federation offers a means of decentralization that fits in well with existing skills and practices. For example, if you can deploy a website, you can probably set up a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon instance</a>. This matters for fostering adoption. Participation at an infrastructure/administration level doesn’t have a steep learning curve or cost of entry.</p>

<p>On the sociological side, it also seems to solve a critical problem: users have a stake in the communities they join.  Or, more accurately, users are part of communities – <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/why-speech-platforms-can-never-escape-politics">it doesn’t make much sense to speak of communities absent individual stakes</a>.  This can help create incentives for the community to define and enforce its boundaries.</p>

<p>However, boundary enforcement and community cultivation seems inextricably tied up in communal ownership of identity. For example, on mastodon, your identity is subject to community/node intervention. Expulsion doesn’t render you a digital nomad; it erases the identity. For what will end up being the most passionate and proselytizing early adopters, this is too repulsive. And while you can propose networks that afford right of <em>intact</em> exit, these have the effect of neutering the enforcement mechanisms. What you have is less of a community and more of a federated network transport.</p>
<p><strong>More to the point, I think the model reflects an implement-what-we-know mentality</strong>. Early websites were nothing more than digital brochures. Federation models try to replicate…schools? Co-op boards? Cities? City states? Nation states? They tend to assume a one-to-one/belongs-to relationship often bound by geography. But the beauty of the internet is that meat space doesn’t bind. And, the brilliance of twitter showed us that association is so free, it’s almost a liquid.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>I saw this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1349079811587780609">@aaronzlewis</a> yesterday and wanted to plug it some how. It vaguely fits, but in any case, Aaron is worth a follow for thinking about this stuff.</span></p>

<p>Recapitulating, Zuckerborg was almost preposterously wrong when he said,<label for="sn-4"></label><span>This is unfair. If you use a loss function which penalizes legibility for the purpose of algorithmic attention resale, he was <em>precisely</em> correct.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have one identity…The days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly […] Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.”</p>

<p>Identity is contextual. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bBieEq">We all wear different masks</a>. And, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distinction-Routledge-Classics-Pierre-Bourdieu/dp/0415567882/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PB4KYKEX2EUU&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=pierre+bourdieu&amp;qid=1610480340&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=pierre+bor%2Cstripbooks%2C237&amp;sr=1-1">we act in ways conditional upon both our expectation, capital, and social environment</a>. This doesn’t betray a “lack of integrity.” It is a fundamental <em>and adaptive</em> part of being a human being.</p>
<p>With this rough sketch, I reach the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals must own their identities</strong>. No one except the person associated with a particular identity can revoke it. The most motivated adopters won’t allow otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The medium itself must not mediate voluntary associations</strong>. That is, for any possible relationship pair, no entity can inhibit <em>direct</em> communication except for either of the participants. This follows from the same adopter assumption. But, it’s also a consequence of the ethereal nature of association absent geographic confinement. While this environment has perils, it is also the source of its continuing promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>This largely precludes federation. Peer-to-peer is the way forward.<label for="sn-5"></label><span>This doesn’t mean there is no role for service providers that act as proxies, caches, aggregators, etc. There surely is and will be. But, I don’t believe they should be part of the p2p core.</span></p>
<h3 id="3-computation-is-the-massage">3. Computation is the Massage</h3><p>I argued that federation won’t work because it relies upon the wrong analogies. But, if any user can reach any user, the possible interaction space is quadratic. We do need something to structure something so incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The social graph is the scaffolding of that structure. It collapses <span>\(n^2\)</span> to something we can cope with. It affords repeated interactions and social recall. It defines an architecture for message passing <em>where we act as the processors</em>.</p>

<p>However, we are social creatures and social media is omnipresent. Viewing ourselves as the processors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s Law</a> becomes oddly relevant: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.  Who we follow increases until we reach the point of desired infinity-scroll saturation. At this point (or well before it), processing demands on a one-to-one basis exceed our human capabilities. <a href="https://generativist.falsifiable.com/metaverse/dunbars-number-is-quadratic">We fall back upon higher-order generalizations. Fuckery ensues.</a></p>

<p>Here, social media critics generally prescribe something like “people-centric technology” as the antidote. Increasingly, I think it’s snake oil. More often then not, you can replace it with <em>RETVRN</em> without loss of meaning. Technology changes the way we relate to each other. With it, so do our aspirations, perceptions, mediators, and institutions. Some expand, and some contract. The way through isn’t to retreat to a now inaccessible past.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>Makes note to reread <em>Industrial Society and Its Future</em> as an exercise in Take Cartography.</span> The way out is to marshal our modern resources into new capabilities.</p>

While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/bitcoin-record-price.html" title="">a month ago</a>, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000. </p><p>The problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations â€” to no avail.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said. â€œThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldnâ€™t work, and I would be desperate again.â€�</p><p>Bitcoin, which has been on an extraordinary and volatile eight-month run, has made a lot of its holders very rich in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/style/bitcoin.html" title="">a short time</a>, even as the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the world economy.</p><p>But the cryptocurrencyâ€™s unusual nature has also meant that many people are locked out of their Bitcoin fortunes as a result of lost or forgotten keys. They have been forced to watch, helpless, as the price has risen and fallen sharply, unable to cash in on their digital wealth.</p><p>Of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin, around 20 percent â€” currently worth around $140 billion â€” appear to be in lost or otherwise stranded wallets, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis. Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it had gotten 70 requests a day from people who wanted help recovering their riches, three times the number of a month ago.</p><p>Bitcoin owners who are locked out of their wallets speak of endless days and nights of frustration as they have tried to get access to their fortunes. Many have owned the coins since Bitcoinâ€™s early days a decade ago, when no one had confidence that the tokens would be worth anything.</p></div></div><div><div><p>â€œThrough the years I would say I have spent hundreds of hours trying to get back into these wallets,â€� said Brad Yasar, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles who has a few desktop computers that contain thousands of Bitcoin he created, or mined, during the early days of the technology. While those Bitcoin are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he lost his passwords many years ago and has put the hard drives containing them in vacuum-sealed bags, out of sight.</p><p>â€œI donâ€™t want to be reminded every day that what I have now is a fraction of what I could have that I lost,â€� he said.</p><p>The dilemma is a stark reminder of Bitcoinâ€™s unusual technological underpinnings, which set it apart from normal money and give it some of its most vaunted â€” and riskiest â€” qualities. With traditional bank accounts and online wallets, banks like Wells Fargo and other financial companies like PayPal can provide people the passwords to their accounts or reset lost passwords.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="â€œI would just lay in bed and think about it,â€� Mr. Thomas said." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/08/business/00LOSTKEYS2/00LOSTKEYS2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async"></picture></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Nicholas Albrecht for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>But Bitcoin has no company to provide or store passwords. The virtual currencyâ€™s creator, a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, has said Bitcoinâ€™s central idea was to allow anyone in the world to open a digital bank account and hold the money in a way that no government could prevent or regulate.</p></div><div><p>This is made possible by the structure of Bitcoin, which is governed by a network of computers that agreed to follow software containing all the rules for the cryptocurrency. The software includes a complex algorithm that makes it possible to create an address, and associated private key, which is known only by the person who created the wallet.</p></div><div><div><p>The software also allows the Bitcoin network to confirm the accuracy of the password to allow transactions, without seeing or knowing the password itself. In short, the system makes it possible for anyone to create a Bitcoin wallet without having to register with a financial institution or go through any sort of identity check.</p><p>That has made Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/bitcoin-black-market.html" title="">popular with criminals</a>, who can use the money without revealing their identity. It has also attracted people in countries like China and Venezuela, where authoritarian governments are known for raiding or shutting down traditional bank accounts.</p><p>But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords.</p><p>â€œEven sophisticated investors have been completely incapable of doing any kind of management of private keys,â€� said<span>  </span>Diogo Monica, a co-founder of a start-up called Anchorage, which helps companies handle cryptocurrency security. Mr. Monica started the company in 2017 after helping a hedge fund regain access to one of its Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>Mr. Thomas, the programmer, said he was drawn to Bitcoin partly because it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html" title="">outside the control of a country</a> or company. In 2011, when he was living in Switzerland, he was given the 7,002 Bitcoin by an early Bitcoin fanatic as a reward for making an animated video, â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What is Bitcoin?</a>,â€� which introduced many people to the technology.</p><p>That year, he lost the digital keys to the wallet holding the Bitcoin. Since then, as Bitcoinâ€™s value has soared and fallen and he could not get his hands on the money, Mr. Thomas has soured on the idea that people should be their own bank and hold their own money.</p><p>â€œThis whole idea of being your own bank â€” let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes?â€� he said. â€œThe reason we have banks is that we donâ€™t want to deal with all those things that banks do.â€�</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other Bitcoin believers have also realized the difficulties of being their own bank. Some have outsourced the work of holding Bitcoin to start-ups and exchanges that secure the private keys to peopleâ€™s stashes of the virtual currency.</p><p>Yet some of these services have had just as much trouble securing their keys. Many of the largest Bitcoin exchanges over the years â€” including the onetime well-known exchange <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/mt-gox-creditors-seek-trillions-where-there-are-only-millions.html" title="">Mt. Gox</a> â€” have lost private keys or had them stolen.</p><p>Gabriel Abed, 34, an entrepreneur from Barbados, lost around 800 Bitcoin â€” now worth around $25 million â€” when a colleague reformatted a laptop that contained the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet in 2011.</p><p>Mr. Abed said this did not dim his enthusiasm. Before Bitcoin, he said, he and his fellow islanders had not had access to affordable digital financial products like the credit cards and bank accounts that are easily available to Americans. In Barbados, even getting a PayPal account was almost impossible, he said. The open nature of Bitcoin, he said, gave him full access to the digital financial world for the first time.</p><p>â€œThe risk of being my own bank comes with the reward of being able to freely access my money and be a citizen of the world â€” that is worth it,â€� Mr. Abed said.</p><p>For Mr. Abed and Mr. Thomas, any losses from mishandling the private keys have partly been assuaged by the enormous gains they have made on the Bitcoin they managed to hold on to. The 800 Bitcoin Mr. Abed lost in 2011 were a small fraction of the tokens he has since bought and sold, allowing him to recently buy a 100-acre plot of oceanfront land in Barbados for over $25 million.</p><p>Mr. Thomas said he also managed to hold on to enough Bitcoin â€” and remember the passwords â€” to give him more riches than he knows what to do with. In 2012, he joined a cryptocurrency start-up, Ripple, that aimed to improve on Bitcoin. He was rewarded with Rippleâ€™s own native currency, known as XRP, which rose in value.</p></div></div><div><div><p>(Ripple has recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/technology/ripple-cryptocurrency-sec-lawsuit.html" title="">run into legal troubles</a>, in part because the founders had too much control over the creation and distribution of the XRP coins.)</p><p>As for his lost password and inaccessible Bitcoin, Mr. Thomas has put the IronKey in a secure facility â€” he wonâ€™t say where â€” in case cryptographers come up with new ways of cracking complex passwords. Keeping it far away helps him try not to think about it, he said.</p><p>â€œI got to a point where I said to myself, â€˜Let it be in the past, just for your own mental health,â€™â€� he said. </p></div></div></section></article></div>]]>

January 13, 2021 | https://valand.dev/blog/post/complex-software--async-machines | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://valand.dev/blog/post/complex-software--async-machines">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Complex software can be daunting to author. I will dissect and reintroduce the concept of asynchronous machines, why we need it in the first place, and how delving into the concept might help conquer complex software.</p>
<h2>Software Complexity</h2>
<p>Software complexity is the number of components inside a software, assuming that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">a single component has a single responsibility</a>. A software with a single component that does a lot of things is regarded as not only complex but also <em>amess</em>, but I'm not going to visit that idea. I don't stick to the strict definition of single-responsibility principle that comes from OOP, therefore a component is not necessarily a class, a struct. It's just one part of a software of many with a clear distinction from the others.</p>
<h2>Async Machines</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"><em>"Machine is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action." - wikipedia.com</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are we mentioning "machine" at all?</p>
<p>Computer is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automaton</a>, a self-operating machine that follows a predetermined sequence of operations. Those operations are what we call a program. Being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>, a computer can simulate itself, therefore a program can be a machine too.</p>
<p>A video game runs, you play it. While it is running, it reads inputs from peripherals. Those inputs alter the internal state. At one point, the video game can reach a particular state that prompts it to quit. That video game is a machine. Another example, NodeJS. NodeJS loads and interprets JavaScript code and executes it. In this situation, NodeJS is the machine, while the JavaScript code is the program. This is why NodeJS is a VM.</p>
<p>A program can be as boring as receiving input, processing it, and spewing output, but each passing day that simple thing does not suffice. Computers gain new capabilities, file systems, networking, multi-threading, GPU processing, and those are made available through hardware with different speeds. And not to forget the most important part of the realm of computer, human, its user, doesn't like to be kept waiting. That's why a simple input, computation, output doesn't suffice. Everything around the program, hardware interfaces, humans, are all working and reacting at different paces. Inputs and outputs are needed at different intervals. This is the original reason why the concept of asynchronous machines exists.</p>
<p>Essentially, the concept of asynchronous machines is to make all parties, which are the I/O edges of the program, the happiest they can be.</p>
<p>A case: A browser is a complex system. It is responsible for many things, connecting to and loading from servers, running web pages, sandboxing tabs, synchronizing web storage to disks, etc. In it are asynchronous machines, each responsible for different parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. This is a human facing machine. It must always be responsive to user input. You can find evidence that unresponsiveness is an intolerable behavior for this machine, such as calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive", offering the user an escape hatch, killing the page, to make sure that the user has options all the time.</li>
<li>A tab is running a page. Inside a page is HTML DOM, CSS style computation and JavaScript code execution. It is a human facing. It must always be responsive to user input. Unresponsiveness is intolerable for it. You can find evidence of that anywhere. For example, calling a long-running JavaScript operation will trigger a prompt that says "page is unresponsive". Then it offers the user an escape hatch: to kill the page.</li>
<li>A storage-facing program is "happy" when it efficiently reads and writes to storage.</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Messaging is the most important basis of asynchronous machines. Messaging happens at small scale, like communication between threads, as well as at large scale, like blockchain mining. Synchronous APIs directed towards asynchronous machines are either wrapper for request/response with messaging underneath, or fire-and-forget message.</p>
<p>Messaging involves message queues at the receiver's side, and sometimes at the sender's side too. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer">buffer</a> at the I/O to hardware is a message queue. Hardware and a program are separate asynchronous machines. They need buffers to store unprocessed messages.</p>
<p>Queues are abstracted out for a software developer most of the time. For example, NodeJS has a lot of APIs implementing stream. NodeJS's stream is actually a buffer and its processor behind the scene, which triggers events. NodeJS users only have to understand which events do what.</p>
<p>Many projects I have worked on involve writing two or more asynchronous machines at the same time. Usually one is the UI layer and the other is a layer that interacts with storage or network. Most of the time queues need to be handwritten because it needs a custom behavior, such as merging message duplicates, has a custom backpressure mechanism, etc. Then, because the queue is handwritten, the queue runner also needs to be handwritten. The queue is a "singleton function", in which only one instance of it can exist per queue. It runs at the start of the queue appendage and stops when the queue is empty. Then, at the caller's side, a wrapper is written to make an "illusion" of synchronous calls. Most of the time it is fun.</p>
<p>Messaging can either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker">brokered</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">not brokered</a>. A simple brokered messaging would be Mutex that guards access from multiple threads, or Kafka sending messages from one service to another. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. A message broker is essentially the party responsible for transporting messages from one party to the other. Meanwhile, unbrokered messaging is when two parties don't need another party to manage their messages. Peer-to-peer communication is one of those. Being brokered and unbrokered is not a hard 1 or 0 but a spectrum. There can be a messaging mechanism in the middle of the spectrum. Shared storage is, for example, is where multiple parties store data at the same site. The shared storage acts as a passive broker. The difference between brokered and not brokered lies in how a message gets transported and how the receiver and sender must do additional process before and after the transportation, like serialization, validation, etc.</p>
<p>Knowing the existence of a message broker is crucial when you design objects' lifecycle. The message broker must live before the components that rely on it. It also must die after them. This concept seems obvious, but it's not rare for projects to fail this aspect. An easy practice is to structure code chronologically, both for declarative and imperative styles.</p>

    <div data-language="react">
      <pre><code><span>// In declarative language/framework:
// example: react + jsx
(
	&lt;ComponentA&gt; {/* ComponentA is mounted first */}
    	&lt;ComponentB&gt; {/* ComponentB is mounted second */}
            &lt;ComponentC /&gt; {/* ComponentC is mounted last and dismounted first */}
        &lt;/ComponentB&gt; {/* ComponentB is dismounted second */}
    &lt;/ComponentA&gt; {/* ComponentA is dismounted last */}
)
// ComponentA is mounted first and dismounted last
// ComponentB is mounted second and dismounted second
// ComponentC is mounted last and dismounted first</span></code></pre>

<h2>The Line Separating FP vs OOP War Lies At The Edges of Asynchronous Machines</h2>
<p>Let's talk functional programming, or rather, programming with functional style. FP is often regarded as the opposite of OOP, while I think it's not the exact opposite. Sometime in the past birthed a language which forces you to write everything with <code>class</code>. A <code>class</code> has methods, which has call syntax <code>subject.predicate()</code>. <code>subject</code> in a sentence is active, an agent. This paradigm introduces a side effect. In the perspective of the programmer, a program written in an OOP style has many agents, whereas not every kind of program needs multiple agencies.</p>
<p>In an environment where there are no other machines with different paces, a machine only needs one agent, which is itself. The machine receives input and produces output and maybe some side effects. All components inside the machines work at the same pace, so there's no need for sub-agency, message passing, nor buffering. It is like a librarian with one mind and two hands cataloging and organizing books. The program manages data. It makes functional programming a prime paradigm in building a machine. Its principles like immutability over mutability, pure functions, recursion, higher-order functions, result in elegant code.</p>
<p>At the same time, two asynchronous machines have two agencies. Each has their memory, works at their own pace, acts on their own data, and occasionally communicates with each other. This is where the concept of multiple agencies needs to be introduced. This is, where I think, the original concept of OOP (not nowadays' OOP) makes sense. Alan Kay describes OOP as if computers are cells, and they occasionally send messages to each other. This is also why sometimes people throw jokes at functional programming for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqLBc1vFwI">being difficult to do side-effects</a> on.</p>
<p>The line that separates FP and OOP paradigms, moreover how programmers perceive machines because of the two, lies at the edges of asynchronous machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en">"I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages" - Alan Kay</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>Understanding the concept of asynchronous machines is a huge help to me if we're talking about system design. While this piece of writing is a big idea presented in a rough format, I hope you get something out of it as much as I did.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: With data breach risks and regulations on the rise, data access for developers will become increasingly restricted. Add to that the escalating complexity of mimicking production data in-house, and DevOps teams stand to face a sudden shortage of quality data for development and testing in the year ahead.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing riskier than making predictions for 2021, given the unprecedented year that was 2020, is not making predictions and responding to the trends when it comes to data privacy. Reflecting on what we’ve seen in the industry and in conversations with our customers, here are the developments we see unfolding in the year ahead.</p><h2>2021 will be the worst year for data breaches yet.</h2><p>The scale of data breaches will be worse in 2021 than ever before. How do we know? The <a href="https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches" target="_blank">past few years</a> have been nothing but a steady upward climb. Even though the number of <em>breaches</em> decreased from 2019 to 2020, the number of <em>records exposed</em> in those breaches more than doubled, from 15.1 billion records in 2019 to <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/hubfs/Reports/2020/2020%20Q3%20Data%20Breach%20QuickView%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">36 billion in 2020 as of Q3</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies may be fighting the good fight in safeguarding against breaches, but when a breach occurs, they’re losing more data than ever. And with work-from-home now the norm for so many, the risks of a breach are <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/data-security-lapses-surge-in-work-from-home-era" target="_blank">heightened</a>.</p><h2>Remote work will redefine data governance—permanently.</h2><p>With the above in mind, the shift to remote work is changing how people think about <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/remote-work-data-sprawl">security for distributed teams</a>, especially around data minimization and access restrictions. We’re seeing changes in internal processing and an increase in tooling to reduce the use of sensitive data within an organization.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The real potential here is for ways that do so without limiting employees from getting work done. At Tonic, we're doubling down on this need as we believe these shifts are here to stay.</p><h2>Using production data in development is OUT.</h2><p>Thanks to privacy legislation like GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, the shift away from using production data in development and testing has been steadily picking up speed. But it’s not yet the gold standard that it should be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Between the risks of remote work and ever stronger regulations on the horizon, we expect this shift to accelerate dramatically over the coming year. Some companies will opt to create dummy data in house; others will <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/building-data-de-identification-infrastructure">consider the work involved</a>, and seek out solutions like Tonic, to rapidly get high-quality, representative data at scale.</p><h2>Data access will make or break developer productivity.</h2><p>Developer productivity sets apart successful organizations from unsuccessful ones, making rapid, easy access to high quality data more important than ever. As applications become more advanced, the data involved in their use and creation is becoming increasingly complex.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Traditional dev tools simply aren't up to the challenge of meeting today’s data needs, and in-house solutions fail over time. Organizations that don’t find a faster, safer way to get their developers the data they need will be left behind.&nbsp;</p><h2>Privacy needs will impact cloud migrations.</h2><p>Simply put, migrating from on-prem to cloud data lakes needs to be done with privacy in mind. Compliance with regulations can impact how a company's data can be stored in the cloud. Data sanitization pre-migration may be a necessary step in the process, and data access post-migration must be carefully defined. We’re seeing many companies combine the potential of cloud data warehousing like Snowflake with streamlined data de-identification like Tonic to get the best that modern privacy tools and cloud storage solutions have to offer.</p><h2>Federal data privacy legislation is coming.</h2><p>You’ve probably heard <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-may-finally-pass-federal-data-privacy-law-in-2021-2020-12" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/2021-best-chance-for-federal-privacy-legislation/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/predictions-2021-privacy-becomes-an-imperative-in-a-year-of-transition/" target="_blank">as</a> <a href="https://www.information-age.com/forrester-releases-privacy-cyber-security-predictions-2021-123492371/" target="_blank">well</a>. We’re all in agreement: it’s high time the US set a federal standard for data privacy. In the past two years, as many as <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/" target="_blank">27 states</a> have taken matters into their own hands, introducing state-level privacy legislation. California, Maine, and Nevada have already signed their bills into law, complicating the landscape of compliance requirements companies must meet. Legislation at the federal level is in everyone’s best interest, from consumers to legislators to corporations.</p><p>So there you have it, the good, the bad, and the critical to keep in mind as we navigate another year in this unexpected landscape. We’re excited to see Tonic helping our customers address many of these concerns. If safe data access and developer enablement is top of mind for you in 2021 and our predictions strike a chord, <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/demo">drop us a line</a>. Here’s to a safe and happy new year!</p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

Perception of work (job demands and job control) may become a major cause of employees’ work addiction. The international group of researchers including the HSE University scientist explored the link between work addiction risk and health-related outcomes using the framework of Job Demand Control Model. The results were published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7593928/" rel="nofollow"><em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em></a>.</p>  <p>Workaholics are people who usually work seven and more hours more than others per week. There are potential reasons for that: financial problems, poor marriage or pressure by their organization or supervisor. What can differentiate a workaholic behaviour from similar behaviour like work engagement? Workaholism is also known as a behavioural disorder, which means the excessive involvement of the individual in work when an employer doesn’t require or expect it.</p> </div>








    
    
        <p>The scientists aimed to demonstrate the extent to which the work addiction risk is associated with the perception of work (job demands and job control), and mental health in four job categories suggested by Karasek’s model or Job Demand-Control-Support model (JDCS). The JDCS model assumes four various work environments (four quadrants) in which workers may experience a different level of job demands and job control: passive, low-strain, active, and tense/job-strain. Job control is the extent to which an employee feels control over doing work.</p>


<div><ul>  <li>Passive” jobs (low job control, low job demands) might be satisfying to a worker as long as the workers reach the set goal.</li>  <li>Low strain” jobs have high job control and low job demands. Individuals in this category are not particularly at risk of mental health problems, and it corresponds typically to creative jobs such as architects.</li>  <li>Active” workers have high job demands and high job control. They are highly skilled professionals with responsibilities, such as heads or directors of companies. Those highly skilled workers have very demanding tasks but they have high levels of decision latitude to solve problems.</li>  <li>Finally, workers at risk of stress-related disorders are those within the “job strain” group (high demand and low control). For example, healthcare workers from emergency departments are typically in job strain because they cannot control the huge workload.</li> </ul>  <p>The study was conducted in France because it is one of the industrial countries with growing numbers of occupations. The authors of the research collected data from 187 out of 1580 (11.8%) French workers who agreed to participate in a cross-sectional study using the WittyFit software online platform. The self-administered questionnaires were the Job Content Questionnaire by Karasek, the Work Addiction Risk Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and socio-demographics. The authors of this study divided all the participants based on their occupational groups and investigated the link between work addiction risk and mental and physical health outcomes.</p> </div>

Assistant&nbsp;Professor at the HSE&nbsp;<a href="https://ioe.hse.ru/en/">Institute of Education</a></h4>

<p>‘One of the novelties of this research was to introduce vulnerable occupational groups to organizations or job holders. For example, if we find that work addiction risk can be found more in some occupations and may result in negative outcomes for the health situation then we can give this information to decision makers in this organization or, for example, to the ministry of health. And they could intervene to prevent this problem.’</p>

            
        </div>


<div><p>The results show that high job demands at work are strongly associated with work addiction risk but the job control level does not play the same role. The prevalence of work addiction risk is higher for active and high-strain workers than for passive and low-strain workers. These two groups of workers appeared to be more vulnerable and therefore can suffer more from the negative outcomes of work addiction risk, in terms of depression, sleep disorder, stress and other health issues.</p>  <p>‘We found that job demands could be the most important factor that can develop work addiction risk. So this factor should be controlled or should be investigated by the organization's manager, for example, HR staff, psychologists. Also another conclusion could be the job climate like job demands of each job category can influence the rate of work addiction risk. Thus in this study we actually focused on external factors like job demands not internal factors like the personal characteristics,’ adds Morteza Charkhabi.</p>  <p>The researchers found that people with higher work addiction risk compared to people with low work addiction risk have twice the risk of developing depression. Sleep quality was lower to workers with high risk of work addiction compared to workers with low risk of work addiction. Also women had almost twice the work addiction risk than men.</p> </div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

  <article>
    
     
      
    <p>This isn’t a theoretical piece about freedom and digital technologies. This is a real ongoing trend that is at best observed around secure messaging application Signal by Open Whisper Systems and it’s founder Moxie Merlinspike. His view and management of Signal reflects a wider trend that jepordises world’s freedom.</p>
<p>Signal is a secure messaging software that has changed the field a lot. Signal is built upon propriety software Textsecure and RedPhone applications that had been developed by Merlinspike and his co-founder Stuart Anderson. When Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, it releases both software under free software licenses. Merlinspike left Twitter acquired Whisper Systems, founded Open Whisper Systems and merged -once the private property of himself- TextSecure and Redphone into Signal.</p>
<p>Signal is free software. “Free as in freedom”, their client and server code is licenced under GPLv3 and AGPLv3. This makes the code and only the code itself pro-freedom. Just because the code it self free does not necessarily make the coder “free” as well and that is the problem we face today!</p>
<p>Open Whisper Systems led by Moxie Merlinspike, who is behind Signal, is and was never behind freedom. This has been seen in the light of LibreSignal (<a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165">https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issuecomment-217211165</a>) debate where a fork of Signal client is build without unfree dependencies and published on the F-droid free software repository on Android. After much debate about federation, the claimed server resources and freedom, followed by legal trademark threats Libresignal has been removed from F-droid and so was anybody’s chance of using Signal as a secure messenger who doesn’t use Google services. <a href="https://wire.com/en/blog/axolotl-proteus-encryption-protocols/">Wire</a> case is just another example.</p>
<p>This approach is not only a threat to free software it is a recurring threat to human kind!</p>
<p>To prove this bold claim one needs to look at one recent blog post from Open Whisper Systems and a presentation made in 36C3 by Merlinspike.</p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">Signal’s blog post</a>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">Matrix’s blog Post</a></p>
<p>The main points of his claims can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to build</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to evolve</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are harder to secure</li>
<li>Decentralized systems are becoming concentrated in predominant provider anyways</li>
<li>If users don’t trust their app provider they have the freedom to use something else</li>
</ul>
<p>While his claims are true up to a certain point they are only superficial. Through these points Merlinspike claims that, centralized services are superior in modern times!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">anyone who is interested in the depth of this debate can start reading Martix’s answer to Merlinspike at the link here</a></p>
<p>It is really unnecessary to explain in depth why this type of thinking is dangerous when a simple change in words can tell more than 1000 page work. Let’s rename the object and compare his digital dystopia with one that has occured several times through-out analog human history and which once again recures today;</p>
<ul>
<li>Democracies are harder to build</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to improve</li>
<li>Democracies are harder to secure</li>
<li>In democracies power is becoming concentrated in predominant hands anyways</li>
<li>If people do not like their democracy provider (country) they have the freedom to leave and go another provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>One doesn’t need to think hard to see what Merlinspike is advising. He claims democracies suck because of the hardships of human organization and proposes autocracy to manage the world in favour of the helpless people occupying it. Why? Because democracies are inefficient and people don’t want that!</p>
<p>If he had given the same statement about democracies and governmental politics as he gave about federative systems it would have provoked outrage! People died for freedom, they are still dying and struggling around the globe. Then someone comes and stomps over every ideal which human society ever build up until this point in history and proclaims themselves the world leader! Think about it!</p>
<p>The example given is bad but why are Merlinspike’s claims about decentralized systems not considered bad as well? Because digital freedom has not yet been lost and won by blood or are we still asleep? Just because code is free, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the coders mind is also free! Freedom is not just a license, it is an ideal in any condition that we must stand for!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anti-cheat development is, by nature, reactive; anti-cheats exist to respond to and thwart a videogame’s population of cheaters. For instance, a videogame with an exceedingly low amount of cheaters would have little need for an anti-cheat, while a videogame rife with cheaters would have a clear need for an anti-cheat. In order to catch cheaters, anti-cheats will employ as many methods as possible. Unfortunately, anti-cheats are not omniscient; they can not know of every single method or detection vector to catch cheaters. Likewise, the game hacks themselves must continue to discover new or unique methods in order to evade anti-cheats.</p><h2 id="the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking"> <a href="#the-reactive-development-cycle-of-game-hacking">The Reactive Development Cycle of Game Hacking</a></h2><p>This brings forth a reactive and continuous development cycle, for both the cheats and anti-cheats: the opposite party (cheat or anti-cheat) will employ a unique method to circumvent the adjacent party (anti-cheat or cheat) which, in response, will then do the same.</p><p>One such method employed by an increasing number of anti-cheats is to execute core anti-cheat functions from within the operating system’s kernel. A clear advantage over the alternative (i.e. usermode execution) is in the fact that, on Windows NT systems, the anti-cheat can selectively filter which processes are able to interact with the memory of the game process in which they are protecting, thus nullifying a plethora of methods used by game hacks.</p><p>In response to this, many (but not all) hack developers made (or are making) the decision to do the same; they too would, or will, execute their hack, either wholly or in part, from within the operating system’s kernel, thus nullifying what the anti-cheats had done.</p><p>Unlike with anti-cheats, however, this decision carries with it numerous concessions: namely, the fact that, for various reasons, it is most convenient (or it is only practical) to execute the hack as an unsigned kernel driver running without the kernel’s knowledge; the “driver” is typically a region of executable memory in the kernel’s address space and is never loaded or allocated by the kernel. In other words, it is a “manually-mapped” driver, loaded by a tool used by a game hack.</p><p>This ultimately provides anti-cheats with many opportunities to detect so-called “kernel-mode” or “ring 0” game hacks (noting that those terms are typically said with a marketable significance; they are literally used to market such game hacks, as if to imply robustness or security); if the anti-cheat can prove that the system is executing, or had executed, unsigned code, it can then potentially flag a user as being a cheater.</p><h3 id="analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>One such method - the focus of this article, in fact - of detecting unsigned code execution in the kernel is to iterate each thread that is running in the system (optionally deciding to only iterate threads associated with the system process, i.e. system threads) and to initiate some kind of stack trace.</p><p>Bluntly, this allows the anti-cheat to quite effectively determine if a cheat were executing unsigned code. For example, some anti-cheats (e.g. BattlEye) will queue to each system thread an APC which will then initiate a stack trace. If the stack trace returns an instruction pointer that is not within the confines of any loaded kernel driver, the anti-cheat can then know that it may have encountered a system thread that is executing unsigned code. Furthermore, because it is a stack trace and not a direct sampling of the return instruction pointer, it would work quite reliably, even if a game hack were, for example, executing a spin-loop or continuous wait; the stack trace would always lead back to the unsigned code.</p><p>It is quite clear to any cheat developer that they can respond to this behavior by simply running their thread(s) with kernel APCs disabled, preventing delivery of such APCs and avoiding the detection vector. As is will be seen, however, this method does not entirely prevent detection of unsigned code execution.</p><h3 id="copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack"> <a href="#copying-out-then-analyzing-a-threads-kernel-stack">(Copying Out, Then) Analyzing a Thread’s Kernel Stack</a></h3><p>Certain anti-cheats - EasyAntiCheat, in particular - had a much more apt method of generating a pseudo-stacktrace: instead of generating a stack trace with a blockable APC, why not copy the contents of the thread’s kernel stack asynchronously? Continuing the reactive cheat-anti-cheat development cycle, EasyAntiCheat had opted to manually search for instances of nonpaged code pointers that may have been left behind as a result of system thread execution.</p><p>While the downsides of this method are debatable, the upside is quite clear: as long as the thread is making procedure calls (e.g. x86 call instruction) from within its own code, either to kernel routines or to its own, and regardless of its IRQL or if the thread is even running, its execution will leave behind detectable traces on its stack in the form of pointers to its own code which can be extracted and analyzed.</p><h2 id="callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle"> <a href="#callouts-continuing-the-reactive-development-cycle">Callouts: Continuing The Reactive Development Cycle</a></h2><p>Proposed is the “callout” method of system thread execution, born from the recognition that:</p><ol><li>A thread’s kernel stack, as identified by the kernel stack pointer in a thread’s ETHREAD object, can be analyzed asynchronously by a potential anti-cheat to detect traces of unsigned code execution; and that</li><li>To be useful in most cases, a system thread must be able to make calls to most external NT kernel or executive procedures with little compromise.</li></ol><h3 id="the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-life-cycle-of-the-callout-thread">The Life-cycle of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The life-cycle of a callout thread is quite simple and can be used to demonstrate its implementation:</p><ul><li>Before thread creation:<ul><li>Allocate a non-paged stack to be loaded by the thread; the callout thread’s “real stack”</li><li>Allocate shellcode (ideally in executable memory not associated with the main driver module) which disables interrupts, preserves the old/kernel stack pointer (as it was on function entry), loads the real stack, and jumps to an initialization routine (the callout thread’s “bootstrap routine”)</li><li>Create a system thread (i.e. PsCreateSystemThread) whose start address points to the initialization shellcode</li></ul></li><li>At thread entry (i.e. the bootstrap routine):<ul><li>Preserve the stack pointer that had been given to the thread at thread entry (this must be given by the shellcode)</li><li>(Optionally) Iterate the thread’s old/kernel stack pointer, ceasing iteration at the stack base, eliminating any references/pointers to the initialization shellcode</li><li>(Optionally) Eliminate references to the initialization shellcode within the thread’s ETHREAD; for example, it may be worth changing the thread’s start address</li><li>(Optionally, but recommended) Free the memory containing the initialization shellcode, if it was allocated separately from the driver module</li><li>Proceed to thread execution</li></ul></li></ul><p>In clearer terms, the callout thread spends most of its time executing the driver’s unsigned code with interrupts disabled and with its own kernel stack - the real stack. It can also attempt to wipe any other traces of its execution which may have been present upon its creation.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-the-callout-thread">The Usefulness of the Callout Thread</a></h3><p>The callout thread must also be capable of executing most, if not all, NT kernel and executive procedures. As proposed, this is effectively impossible; the thread must run with interrupts disabled and with its own stack, thus creating an obvious problem as most procedures of interest would run at an IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Furthermore, the NT IRQL model may be liable to ignore our setting of the interrupt flag, causing most routines to unpredictibly enter a deadlock or enable interrupts without our consent.</p><p>A mechanism to allow for a callout thread to invoke these routines of interest, the callout mechanism, is therefore used to:</p><ol><li>Provide a routine which can be used to conveniently invoke (“call out”) an external function; and in this routine,</li><li>Load the thread’s original/kernel stack pointer;</li><li>Copy function arguments on to the kernel thread’s stack from the real stack;</li><li>Enable interrupts;</li><li>Invoke the requested routine (within the same instruction boundary as when interrupts are enabled);</li><li>Cleanly return from the routine without generating obvious stack traces (e.g. function pointers);</li><li>Load the real stack pointer and disable the interrupt flag, and do so before returning to unsigned code; and</li><li>Continue execution, preserving the function’s return value</li></ol><p>While somewhat complicated, the callout mechanism can be achieved easily and, to a reasonable degree, portably, using two widely-available ROP gadgets from within the NT kernel.</p><h3 id="the-usefulness-of-iretq"> <a href="#the-usefulness-of-iretq">The Usefulness of IRET(Q)</a></h3><p>The constraint of needing to load a new stack pointer, interrupt flag, and interrupt pointer within an instruction boundary was immediately satisfied by the IRET instruction.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the IRET (lit. “interrupt return”) instruction is intended to be used by an operating system or executive (here, the NT kernel) to return from an interrupt routine. To support the recognition of an interrupt from any mode of execution, and to generically resume to any mode of execution, the processor will need to (effectively) preserve the instruction pointer, stack pointer, CPL or privilege level (through the CS and SS selectors; and while they have a more general use-case, this is effectively what is preserved on most operating systems with a flat memory model), and RFLAGS register (as interrupts may be liable to modify certain flags).</p><p>To report this information to the OS interrupt handler, the CPU will, in a specific order:</p><ol><li>Push the SS (stack segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RSP (stack pointer) register;</li><li>Push the RFLAGS (arithmetic/system flags) register;</li><li>Push the CS (code segment selector) register;</li><li>Push the RIP (instruction pointer) register; and, for some exception-class interrupts,</li><li>Push an error code which may describe certain interrupt conditions (e.g. a page fault will know if the fault was caused by a non-present page, or if it were caused by a protection violation)</li></ol><p>Note that the error code is not important to the CPU and must be accounted for by the interrupt handler. Each operation is an 8-byte push, …</p></div></div>

				<p>So my last blog post, <a href="https://patrobinson.github.io/2016/11/05/docker-in-production/">Docker in Production: A retort</a>, generated a lot of comments. One of them was “Why shouldn’t you run a Database in Docker?” I’ve seen this questions a few times, but rarely reply because it’s such a long answer. But here goes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I’ve been made aware I’m not being clear that I am referring to running a database in a container management solution, like Kubernetes. The issues laid out below don’t relate to just running your database in docker with no shared storage or ability to start it automatically on a different node.</p>

<h2 id="kelsey-hightower-told-you-not-to">Kelsey Hightower told you not to</h2>

<p>He’s a smart guy, he’s worked at CoreOS and now works at Google. He has done some fantastic talks on Docker, Kubernetes and System Administration in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Nosa5-xcATw?t=1080">Here’s him talking about it</a></p>

<h2 id="distributed-systems-are-hard">Distributed systems are hard</h2>

<p>Like really hard. But that’s ok when your application is stateless, because when it all goes to shit you just reboot things and they magically get better. But when your database gets fubar you can end up with permanent corruption. The most complex part of a distributed system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#The_Byzantine_Generals.27_Problem">Byzantine Generals problem</a>, which describes the problem of how we determine what is the source of truth and how do we know for certain it is the only source of truth. There are various solutions to this problem, usually implemented in the storage engine of databases. Some databases do this well, mostly NoSQL databases where it’s possible to shard data across multiple nodes by not supporting a JOIN operation. Traditional relational databases do not do this well, they generally only work  in a master-slave configuration. There are ways to run them in master-master configuration but you need a very specific skill type to execute this. If you’re doing this, well why are you reading my blog post? You know better than I do.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine what is the master node, which involves some kind of conensus algorithm and an odd number of nodes to vote on it, then you will end up with data loss and/or corruption.</p>

<h2 id="volume-management-for-docker-is-still-in-its-infancy">Volume management for Docker is still in it’s infancy</h2>

<p>There isn’t a well respected solution for how to do volume management for Docker clusters right now. Some people use NFS, but it lacks any kind of locking support on files (see <a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html">this blog</a> for more details on linux file lock support). So you cannot guarentee that another system is not writing to your files.</p>

<p>GlusterFS is a recent successor to NFS, that offers much better performance, clustering and scalability. However it has several known issues that render locking unreliable.<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1194546">1</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287099">2</a></p>

<h2 id="you-lied-to-us-i-can-total-run-my-nosql-database-in-docker">You lied to us! I can total run my NoSQL database in Docker</h2>

<p>The answer here is it really depends on the underlying technology. As stated, there is no solution for filesystem level replication of data (except in a few proprietary solutions like AWS’s flagship database Aurora, VMware File System and Google File System, none of which tackle this specific use case). So instead we must rely on the storage engine of the database to do clustering and replication for us. Some are well known for their support of this (etcd, ElasticSearch and Riak KV to name a few), but it needs to be considered on a case by case basis to evaluate how well the particular database deals with this problem, because it’s so easy to get wrong.</p>

<h2 id="with-great-knowledge-comes-great-responsibility">With great knowledge comes great responsibility</h2>

<p>Now you know why there is significant anxiety to running databases in Docker, you have the power to make the decision for yourself.</p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to learn more I highly recommend Pintrest’s blog on <a href="https://engineering.pinterest.com/blog/sharding-pinterest-how-we-scaled-our-mysql-fleet">how they sharded their MySQL Cluster</a>. They use Zookeeper, similar to etcd, to keep the configuration of which data lives in which MySQL database. This provides a highly available, consistent store. But they still recommend you “only read/write to the master… It simplifies everything and avoids lagged replication bugs.”</p>

<p>I’ve yet to see a blog post about somebody containerising their MySQL server and how it went really well.</p>

<h2 id="edit-some-solutions-to-the-problems-i-have-presented-here">EDIT: Some solutions to the problems I have presented here</h2>

<p>Some people have pointed out a couple of solutions to the problem presented here. One is the Kubernetes <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/">PetSet</a> concept. While still in Alpha (so obviuosly not fit for Production), this looks to be solving the exact problem of ensuring one and only one master exists at any one time.</p>

<p>Uber also <a href="https://eng.uber.com/dockerizing-mysql/">blogged about their dockerizing of MySQL</a> which is a very similar solution to the Kubernetes approach. They are defining the cluster topology up front, which guarentees a single master. They don’t talk about how they generate the master, but since that obviously comes from another source it’s likely highly consistent.</p>

<p>So today we still can’t run Docker inside a container cluster, but there are some good solutions on the roadmap.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root for
a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if the
buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it return
<code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote buffers.</p><p>Emacs
<i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advices</a></i> are a way of modifying the behavior of existing functions without
having to redefine them. They serve a similar purpose as hooks, but are
more flexible.</p><p>I then wrote a function that falls back to <code>ffip</code> when projectile is
disabled and bound it to the keybinding I had for <code>projectile-find-file</code>,
so that I could press the same keybinding whenever I wanted to search for
projects files, and not have to think about whether I’m on a remote buffer
or not:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

garbage collecting. I had <code>garbage-collection-messages</code> set to <code>t</code> so I could
already tell that Emacs was GCing a lot; enabling this setting makes a
message be displayed in the echo area whenever Emacs garbage collects. I
could also see the Emacs process consuming 100% of one CPU core while it was
frozen and unresponsive to input.</p><p>The <code>profiler</code> package implements a

ignore it for now.</p><p>As I get deep in drilling down on <code>ivy--insert-minibuffer</code>, names in the

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/videolan">The NuGet VideoLAN account</a> just reached half a million downloads in the .NET ecosystem.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://nugettrends.com/packages?months=24&amp;ids=VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows&amp;ids=LibVLCSharp&amp;ids=LibVLCSharp.Forms&amp;ids=VideoLAN.LibVLC.iOS&amp;ids=VideoLAN.LibVLC.Android"><img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/nugettrends.png"></a>
</p>

<p>The first publication of the first VideoLAN NuGet package dates back to April 1st, 2018 (no joke!). We have been steadily adding new packages since then to cover all platforms supported by both LibVLC and .NET.</p>

<p>Today, we actively publish and maintain <strong>15 NuGet packages</strong>, 6 of which  actually containing native platform-specific code. The remaining 9 packages are managed C# DLLs composed of the main binding (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp/">LibVLCSharp</a>) and various GUI toolkit integrations for getting users up and running quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xamarin.Android</li>
  <li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.tvOS</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Mac (Cocoa)</li>
  <li>Windows Classic (WPF, WinForms, GTK)</li>
  <li>Windows Universal (UWP for Desktop, mobile and Xbox)</li>
  <li>Linux including desktop, server and Raspberry Pi (GTK)</li>
  <li>Xamarin.Forms</li>
  <li>Uno Platform (UWP, Android, iOS)</li>
  <li>Avalonia (Windows, macOS, Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>LibVLCSharp counts about <strong>19 contributors</strong>, with most people doing one-off contributions and mainly 2 active maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyVignelles">Jérémy</a> and myself). I’d like to thank each of them for their valuable OSS contributions!</p>



<p>Many exciting things! More game engine integrations, ongoing LibVLC 4 support, interop performance improvements and plenty of new integrations, samples and features are yet to be implemented.</p>

<p>We have a diverse and (mostly) well-defined <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/issues">backlog</a> of both features to implement and bugs to fix, with a varying degree of difficulty, and always welcome new contributors. We are available on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF">LibVLC community Discord server</a> (320+ members).</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace for all your knowledge and research following the <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a> guide.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/graph-visualisation.md" title="Graph Visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/backlinking.md" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions.md" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes.md" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read about our [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles.md" title="Principles">principles</a>] to understand Foam’s philosophy and direction</li>
  <li>Read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/contribution-guide.md" title="Contribution Guide">contribution-guide</a>] guide to learn how to participate.</li>

A lot has changed for me. I gave up management by quitting my job as a Director of Engineering and took a job as just a good ol' Software Engineer at <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a>. A lot of reasoning went into that decision, but to sum it up: I was sick of commuting and managing. Considering what's happened in the last year, I'm glad I made that choice!</p><p>As a lifelong introvert, I was being drained on a daily basis by having to manage other people. I had been juggling that while still coding for about four years straight. During that time, I was a user of Ghost Inspector, so when the opportunity opened up, I jumped at the chance to work there and I'm so glad that I did.</p><p>What attracted me to Ghost Inspector was the product, but what has kept me here is the amazing work environment. There may be bigger, more exciting challenges in the job market, but working here is without a doubt the best job I've ever had! For most of my career, I jumped from company to company, looking for that "hockey stick growth". But what I eventually realized is that I'd rather have stability and trust. At previous startups, we were only stable for the few months after the most recent funding round.&nbsp;<a href="https://ghostinspector.com/about/">Justin and the rest of the team</a>&nbsp;have built a business that grows at a very sustainable pace. We're only beholden to our customers, not venture capital investors. The only deadlines are the ones we set for ourselves, and those are pretty rare.</p><p>The typical Agile process used by most software companies creates a lot of meetings that, in my opinion, are not respectful of a software developer's time. The majority of meetings are focused on determining what they should work on, when they should start, and how long it should take. A system designed around tracking velocity with points, will heavily incentivize speed and efficiency. So now all those meetings talking about work, instead of doing it, feel like impediments to completing points. I have worked at places that handle this better than others, but there's always that underlying pressure that creates at least a bit of animosity around meetings.</p><p>We have a completely different process at Ghost Inspector. I would describe our software development methodology as Agile-lite -- we take the few good parts and leave the rest behind. We have a backlog of epics and stories with all the good features we want to deliver to our customers. However we&nbsp;<strong>don't do sprints</strong>. Without sprints, we're able to skip all the other Agile rituals that I personally loath. Here's a list of all the&nbsp;<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile">meetings we don't do</a>. No sprints means no sprint planning. No points means no estimation meetings. Without a product owner needing to constantly check the velocity of every story, we don't need to give a status update every day. We generally only meet once a week. Thankfully, not once do I remember anyone saying the word "blocker".</p><p>I've lost track of the amount of time wasted on just scheduling meetings at previous companies. Even the daily status was always hotly debated. Too early and all the night owls are grumbling. Too late and you risk interrupting the flow of the early birds. I can't tell you how nice it is to stop thinking so much about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we work and instead just think about the actual work. My levels of stress have been reduced to an extremely low level while working here. The meetings we do have feel particularly important and useful and I welcome them!</p><p>As a developer, I have all the autonomy I could ever wish for. There are constant opportunities to learn new skills. We don't work on the bleeding edge by any means, but we have a diverse set of projects that allow us to experiment with new technologies. Here's a truncated list of all the different projects I've worked on in the last year and a half:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">a WordPress plugin with e2e tests in Docker on CI</a></li><li>two-factor authentication using Auth0</li><li>rebuilt the browser extension in React.js</li><li>built a user-facing search engine with Elasticsearch</li><li>added API endpoints to export to CSV (with documentation!)</li><li>created a deploy script with an <a href="https://github.com/nanovazquez/yargs-interactive">interactive CLI</a> and GitHub action checks</li><li>wrote <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/ghost-inspector-wordpress-plugin/">several</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/develop-wordpress-plugin-with-webpack-and-react/">different</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/automated-ui-testing-for-wordpress/">blog</a> <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/blog/continuous-integration-testing-for-wordpress/">posts</a></li></ul><p>All of this is possible because we have a rock-solid customer base, a stable system for our application, a team who trusts and respects each other, and a CEO who enables us to do our best work. I'm really happy to have joined the team.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/simpixelated">Twitter</a> and don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about moving from management back to individual contributor, or using the good parts of agile, or how to avoid meetings!

<p>Email is a powerful tool that is an inextricable part of everyone’s lives.
Despite countless valiant efforts to kill it and replace it with something
better, email continues to live on in more or less the same form it has had
since the 1990s. Technology that endures this long deserves a fair amount of
attention and praise.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why email continues to be useful today. It is simple
to use, and it is not owned or controlled by a single company. Every attempted
replacement has failed at excelling in either one or both of those qualities.
Simple tools can often be extended in ways that the original authors never could
have imagined in the beginning. And because users are in control of the core
functionality, new use cases can be explored completely independently.</p>

<p>Computer users have a tendency to over-generalize when solving problems. In
other words, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In
this post, we are going to be looking at a lot of nails that can probably be
hammered down with email. At a fundamental level, email clients are tools
designed for storing and retrieving sequences of messages which can contain
arbitrary data. Looking at it this way, it is not difficult to imagine a variety
of use cases that can be accomplished with minimal amounts of scripting.</p>

<p>I do seriously think that email is a solid tool for a lot of these purposes, and
in fact use it as such for a few of these purposes every day. However, the main
purpose of this post is exploration, not general advice.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list-one-that-you-actually-check">To-Do List (One That You Actually Check)</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/todo-list.png" alt="To-Do List"></p>

<p>The first use case is pretty obvious, and it is one that likely a large number of
people already employ on a daily basis.</p>

<p>By far the single most important productivity discovery that I made in my life
is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz">Inbox Zero</a>. Inbox Zero is
the simple idea that your email inbox should contain only a list of messages
that require some sort of action. Once the action associated with those messages
is completed, the message is archived or moved to a different folder. I have
been using Inbox Zero for years now and I rarely forget to do anything
important after integrating it into my life.</p>

<p>Need to remember to pack for your flight next week? You probably already got a
confirmation about your reservation in your email. Leave it in your inbox until
you are finished preparing for your trip, and archive it when you are done.</p>

<p>How about one-off reminders that are not associated with messages already in
your inbox? Just send an email to yourself with the action item in the subject
line. Use the body of the message to write down any notes you want, and reply to
the message to keep a record of additional notes if you need them.</p>

<p>What about periodic reminders that repeat on some interval, like reminding
yourself to pay a bill on time every month? Write a simple script that sends you
an email about it and schedule it to run once a month. At the end of each month,
you will have a new to-do item in your inbox with an actionable task in the
subject line.</p>

<p>The great part about using email as a to-do list is that you are already
checking it with some degree of regularity. Smartphone apps or web-based to-do
lists quickly lose their value the moment users lose interest or switch to using
something else. They also frequently become buggy or overburdened with features
that don’t add any value. This will never be a problem with email because you
can always use your favorite client as long as it continues to work with the
standard protocols. Syncing across multiple devices is a given, since your email
is already doing this.</p>

<h2 id="news-reader">News Reader</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/rss2email.png" alt="RSS"></p>

<p>RSS is a really elegant and simple way to subscribe to a feed of updates from
your favorite websites. Since the early 2000s, RSS has been integrated into a
lot of different services all across the net, and serves as the foundation for a
variety of different web-based content platforms such as podcasts.</p>

<p>In order to actually use RSS, you need a client that is capable of aggregating
entries from multiple different feeds and displaying them in some manner.
Managing a list of entries, tracking read or unread state, and displaying HTML
content is exactly what every email client is already good at doing.</p>

<p>I like using <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a> for this.
rss2email delivers stories from my feeds into a special mailbox on my email
server that I check approximately every morning. Since the end result is just
IMAP messages stored on my email server, I can read them using my favorite
email client on whatever device I happen to be using that day.</p>



<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/update-blog.png" alt="Updating a Blog"></p>

<p>Setting up a frictionless workflow for updating your personal website can be
rather difficult, especially if you want to be able to do it while on-the-go and
away from your usual workstation.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining a blog on a personal website or for a business, the focus
should primarily be on the content itself and not on writing markup, updating a
source control repository, or publishing static content to a file server or
database. At the end of the day, you want to be able to write your content in a
message and send it to your server to publish.</p>

<p>Writing rich-text or plain-text content, saving drafts, and publishing that
content to a server is the perfect job for an email client. Your email client
can even allow including inline images sent as attachments, or links that point
to other websites. Once you are done writing your post, send it to a special
email address that activates a script on the other end to convert your email
message into a blog post. <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">PGP</a>
can be used by both the client and the server to ensure that it is actually you
who is authoring the blog post and not someone else. Forget about OAuth or
anything more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Social media feeds can be updated in a similar manner. All of your server-side
functionality can be multiplexed using different email addresses for each
service. For example, you can use <code>blog@mydomain.com</code> to send updates to your
blog, and <code>mastodon@mydomain.com</code> to publish toots on your
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> account. Writing the code for this is a
breeze, since your favorite programming language already has libraries for
dealing with SMTP and IMAP.</p>

<h2 id="a-user-interface-to-a-search-engine-or-database">A User Interface to a Search Engine or Database</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple to build an API for a web service these days. However,
choosing the right library or designing the right API can sometimes be an
unnecessary burden when working on a personal project that only has one or two
users.</p>

<p>Email can be used as an interface between a user and a web service when the
input and output are simple enough.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you have a file server with a large amount of photos
stored on it and you want to be able to search those photos and retrieve them at
random. The server could use machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow to
categorize the photos and attach metadata on them.</p>

<p>Instead of building a custom web-based user interface for this, you could use
email instead. The user sends an email with the search term in the subject line,
such as “pizza”, to a special email address that corresponds to the file server
containing the photos. Just like in the previous example, PGP or S-MIME can be
used as an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can
access the photos being requested. Once the server has collected a search
result, it replies to the query email with matching photos attached as MIME
parts. The email server keeps a record of previous queries, along with their
returned results as replies, in an easily displayable and searchable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-only-limit-is-your-imagination">The Only Limit is Your Imagination</h2>

<p>Connecting email accounts to small shell scripts is a simple but powerful
concept that can unlock a wide variety of different applications. You can build
these apps with the comforting knowledge that they are all based on federated
and robust protocols used by hundreds of different email clients which have
stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Using the rich text editing features of your email client, combined with a
hierarchical organization system based on folders, allows you to do a lot of
tasks that have previously been accomplished using buggy and monolithic tools.
Privacy and security issues that plague web-based tools can be effectively
avoided when using email, because you are in control of both the client and
the server. You also get syncing to multiple devices for free, since IMAP was
designed to facilitate managing email from multiple clients at once since the
beginning.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in learning about new uses of email. If you know about
some of these yourself, send me an email about them.</p>

January 13, 2021 | https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

				<p><em>Alternative title: Young NB Yells At The Cloud</em></p>
<p><strong>Note that this absolutely isn’t vetted for technical accuracy.</strong>
<strong>It’s probably also not a very coherent post altogether.</strong>
<strong>I just needed to get this off my chest.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since late 2019, I’ve been using a Google Pixel 2 as my day-to-day
cellphone. While I’ve known that it didn’t respect my privacy, per the Google
tradition of being creepy and generally terrifying, I wasn’t <em>entirely</em> aware of
this phenomenon until Google told me when I registered my rooted Nook Tablet
with their services in 2014. The fact that this has been recorded six years
later was enough to set me off on a path to de-Googlify my Google phone.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/img/2020-01-28-1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>The first option I found was <a href="https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack">RattlesnakeOS</a>, which is basically just AOSP built
on EC2. While it seemed like a competent option, and it likely is, I didn’t want
to set up an AWS account and pay $5/mo to build it, as I’m already paying $10/mo
on my current servers (including the one hosting this website). In addition,
there’s <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, which is the continuation of the ill-fated CopperheadOS
(which effectively died Because Capitalism^TM after CopperheadOS was
commercialized, effectively killing the project altogether). I opted for the
latter as I wouldn’t have to set up my own build infrastructure on AWS, and the
fact that GrapheneOS decidedly had more features directly geared towards a
“hardened” Android experience, regardless of de-Googlification.</p>
<p>This of course, would be wonderful… if not for a critical roadblock.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-unlock-the-bootloader">Trying to unlock the bootloader</h2>
<p>Here’s how it went down:
“Hey, are you able to unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> Λ ~ fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability
(bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
OKAY [  0.000s]
</code></pre><p>(read: “yeah, sure”)</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>can</em> you unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> λ ~ fastboot flashing unlock
FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')
fastboot: error: Command failed
</code></pre><p>(read: “No, because I’m not able to.")</p>
<p>…so I’m left with Schrödinger’s bootloader (and not the cat from Digital Devil
Saga). Wonderful! Furthermore, I’m not the only one with this issue; not only do
some carriers lock down your ability to OEM unlock, but Google Play Services’
anti-theft protection makes it impossible to do so without an internet
connection, <em>and</em> some refurbished Pixel devices (mine being case-in-point) just
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/unlock-bootloader-refurbished-pixel-2-t4017557">don’t cooperate</a>, regardless as to whether or not it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>My experience with Google support on this topic basically boiled down to “why
are you even trying to unlock the bootloader, you idiot”, so that’s out of the
question. I’d imagine they’re probably not super happy about me stealing profits
from them by trying to escape their ecosystem.</p>
<p>On a happier note, I came across this person on Freenode’s channel #grapheneos,
which eased the tension due to them not breaking character:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil">       hazel1 │ hi yes okay so.
       hazel1 │ i'm on a pixel 2 non-xl, `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` returns 1, but `fastboot flashing unlock` says "Flashing Unlock is not allowed"
       hazel1 │ no idea where to go from here.
TheJollyRoger │ Avast! Did ye enable OEM unlocking in the OS under developer options?
       hazel1 │ i did, yes, that's what `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability = 1` meant
       hazel1 │ also i appreciate your dedication to character.
       hazel1 │ i'm on linux, if that's important, and i'm running these commands as root.
TheJollyRoger │ Shiver me timbers, I be stuck too. Maybe someone else on this here tub will know.
</code></pre><h2 id="why-this-is-stupid">Why this is stupid</h2>
<p>This is where I turn this tech rant into a political rant, as I have no
self-control.</p>
<p>Per the majority of things that happen in the modern tech industry, this is, of
course, a byproduct of capitalism. The fact that carriers or refurbishers <em>can</em>
lock you out of customizing your own device is in it of itself terrifying, on
the merit that it’s an effective paywall to gain control of the hardware you own
— or rather, should own. While I’m a firm believer in security, and a firm
believer that the majority of people have devices that work well enough for them
(given that they’re not privacy conscious…), I’m also under the impression
that <em>people should have control over the things they own</em>. Capitalism, in the
name of profit, contradicts that scheme.</p>
<p>The fact that your carrier owns your phone, or your phone manufacturer owns your
phone, or Google owns your phone, etc, applies in bounds here. While the
saying is generally “if it’s free, you’re the product”, the fact that you’re
<strong>still</strong> the product when buying an expensive device speaks volumes about the
technological ecosystems we tend to depend on in 2020. I should be able to
unlock the bootloader without a second thought, but the fact that some
refurbisher owns the rights to do that with the device I should own, and not me,
worries me deeply.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to worry about whether some random thing I say is going to be
used against me in some creepy fashion three weeks later in an ad that shows up
on a torrent site when I’m trying to scrape the web for some obscure piece of
software that nobody uses or some movie that nobody watched.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that this point has been regurgitated. I’m well aware this post
doesn’t actually make much sense. But regardless, I’m scared that Google has
this much control, and I’m scared that I’m unable to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up--2020-01-29--and-a-potential-explanation">Follow-up (2020-01-29) and a potential explanation</h2>
<p>So apparently this is by design, which pretty much confirms my theory. Great.
Per a user on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605?hl=en">Pixel Phone Help “official support forum”:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: I was able to get a reply from the higher levels in Google and they
simply informed the man handling my case, to his astonishment, that the
refurbishment process is intentionally locking the bootloader and that is the
way they designed it to operate. No options were given to me to remedy the
issue and I was asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss before
they ended the call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous if true.</strong> Not only does it compound on my existing complaint
of bootloader unlocks being behind a paywall, which is already ridiculous, but
it means that even <strong>if</strong> you go through a paywall, any device defect could lead
to a permanently locked bootloader (such as my case). Even more ridiculous is
that Google’s factory Pixel images require a bootloader unlock to flash, meaning
that this locks users out of potential support options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the theory of a refurbished device just being an unlocked
carrier edition phone is true (despite my CID being all zeroes), this is just
<em>negligence</em>.</p>
<p>Even if 99.3\% of users should <em>never</em> have to touch this option, the fact that
Google not only sends refurbished phones, but RMAs of unlockable phones with
this defect is astounding. It attests to the fact that what you own is not truly
yours even moreso than this just being a coincidence — it’s an explicit
hostile action towards the privacy-focused by Google. The former glory of Nexus
devices of being “the modder’s phone” has been changed drastically upon a vision
of a more popular “Google phone”; again, driven by capitalism.</p>

          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

January 12, 2021 | https://rambo.codes/posts/2021-01-08-distributing-mac-apps-outside-the-app-store | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rambo.codes/posts/2021-01-08-distributing-mac-apps-outside-the-app-store">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><a href="#conclusiontldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(326.6) ≈ 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> (about one in a million)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your threat model is a bit smaller, simulate putting a smaller object into the
MOAC’s furnace. For example, the Earth has a mass of 5.972×10²⁴ kg; this gives the
MOAC a one-in-ten-trillion chance of cracking a password with 256 entropy bits and a
100% chance of cracking a 213-bit password.</p>
<h2 id="sample-unbreakable-passwords">Sample unbreakable passwords</h2>
<p>According to KeePassXC’s password generator, each of the following passwords has an
entropy between 330 and 340 bits.</p>

<h2 id="conclusiontldr">Conclusion/TLDR</h2>
<p>Question: How much entropy should a password have to ensure it will <em>never</em> be

<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

										<span>This is The Entire Computer Science Curriculum in 1000 YouTube Videos</span>
			
														
						
						<div>
				<p><span>In this article, we are going to create an entire Computer Science curriculum using only YouTube videos. The Computer Science curriculum is going to cover every skill essential for a Computer Science Engineer that has expertise in Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, like: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.</span></p>
<p>The curriculum is going to be organized in 40 courses in total, further organized in 4 academic years, each containing 2 semesters.</p>
<p>We are going to try to list a few videos per course as we can, so we can keep the list short.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to capture the whole university experience in perspective of the organization of the courses and deliver you the whole curriculum for FREE, so you can gain significant knowledge.</p>
<p>We know that this is not the same as you’ll get at university, but the videos are of high quality, and most of them helped us, during our time at university.</p>
<p>We hope you will like it, and it will be of use to you.</p>
<p>As of today, we’ve seen that most of the visitors on our website, like the articles where we talk about free courses, curriculums, books, etc. Some of our most popular articles in that area are:</p>

<h2><strong>Whole Computer Science Curriculum in 40 YouTube Videos</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Year 1: </strong><strong>Semester 1</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structured Programming (Programming in C)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to <a href="http://laconicml.com/machine-learning-weka/">programming</a>. It will help you write your first code, run your first application, and see what programming is about. You will start with printing messages on the screen, simple arithmetic operations, if-else statements, loops, data structures (arrays, matrices), memory addresses, pointers, reading and writing files, etc. You will build simple applications that will allow you to understand the material even better. The best two videos that we recommend for this course are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C Programming Tutorial For Beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CpG3oATGIs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C Programming Tutorial | Learn C programming | C language</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to declarative statements, sets, and operations with sets, laws, logic, quantifiers, functions, proofs, sequences, and summation. For this course, and it’s a second part which we’ve put in Year 2, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 YouTube videos, but we are going to split it, 34 videos for part 1 (1-34) and 26 videos for the part 2 (35-60).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 1-34)</a></li>
</ol>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3Ffwsnad0k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to limits, intervals, differentiability, continuity, derivatives, antiderivatives, rules, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, optimizations, and sums. It will be a huge help to you, once you dive into the later semesters of your studies and will help you understand most of the <a href="http://laconicml.com/mathematical-skills-data-scientist/">mathematics</a> behind Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here we will suggest you take look at this list of 86 videos. Yes, it looks long, but the videos are quite short and well explained.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1ml6mys-RXoQ0O3GfwBPVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 1 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOjov-2OZ0E" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Computer System Architecture</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, you are going to be introduced to set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache and virtual memory organizations, protection and sharing, I/O and interrupts, in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, VLIW machines, vector supercomputers, multithreaded architectures, symmetric multiprocessors, and parallel computers. For this course, we will recommend you the following playlist coming from <a href="http://laconicml.com/computer-science-engineer-mit-university/">MIT</a>. The list has 39 videos, that are quite long</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3JCL1TWybTDtKq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Systems Architecture full playlist</a></li>
</ol>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLP_X4wyHbY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Web Design (HTML + CSS)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is your introduction to what one stage of web development (the front-end) looks like. You are going to get familiar with HTML, which is the markup language that makes the elements we see on a webpage, and with CSS, which is a stylesheet that gives life to those elements. Here we recommend two videos, one for HTML and one for CSS.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&amp;ab_channel=TraversyMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners</a></li>

<p>This course is one of the most important courses for every Computer Science Engineer who wants to be an expert in <a href="http://laconicml.com/free-artificial-intelligence-courses-by-google/">Machine Learning</a>. The course consists of intro to probability, combinatorics, variations, permutations, distributions, etc.</p>
<p>The playlist that we’ve recommended is from Khan’s Academy. It contains 41 videos that are 10 minutes long at max, and are very interesting, and contain tons of practical examples.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probability playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Statistics</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the other most important courses if you want to do Machine Learning in the future. The course will get you familiar with the main statistical features, hypothesis testing, levels of measurements, etc. The playlist that we recommend contains 28 videos, which are quite long.</p>
<ol>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.confluent.io/blog/property-based-testing-confluent-tiered-storage/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.confluent.io/blog/property-based-testing-confluent-tiered-storage/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>Confluent uses <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/04/step-by-step-toward-property-based-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">property-based testing</a> to test various aspects of Confluent Server’s <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiered Storage</a> feature. Tiered Storage shifts data from expensive local broker disks to cheaper, scalable object storage, thereby reducing storage costs, rebalancing times, and improving elasticity. However, if Tiered Storage is not implemented correctly, the result can be significant data loss.</p>
<p>Property-based testing is highly effective when used in combination with traditional testing techniques, such as example-based testing, integration testing, and so on. This post describes some of the property-based testing that Confluent performs on the log-orientated storage layer of Confluent Server and how we test the integration of Tiered Storage with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>’s traditional storage layer.</p>
<p>Property-based testing aims to test several key behaviors of the log to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must never be prematurely deleted due to the different forms of retention or other log operations</li>
<li>Data must never be exposed incorrectly to follower brokers or consumers</li>
<li>We should not tier data that may potentially be truncated due to Apache Kafka’s replication protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement a stateful property test for the log layer, we used <a href="https://www.scalacheck.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScalaCheck’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md#stateful-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateful testing functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the relevant terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log</strong>: the log that stores replica data for a partition</li>
<li><strong>System Under Test (SUT):</strong> the real system being modelled, which is a log in this case</li>
<li><strong>Log model:</strong> the modeled state for the system under test (SUT)</li>
<li><strong>Log segment:</strong> a unit of zero or more record batches; consists of a .log file and associated indices</li>
<li><strong>Active segment:</strong> the segment with the highest base offset and to which new appends will be written</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> the process by which users control the size of a topic’s partitions by duration, size, or triggered deletions</li>
<li><strong>Log start offset:</strong> the inclusive lower bound offset for the log</li>
<li><strong>Log end offset:</strong> the exclusive upper bound offset for the log</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-state-generator"><a id="initial-state-generator"></a>Initial state generator</h2>
<p>Every property test run must start with an initial state—in this case, a model of the log. To create this initial state, we define an initial state generator. The primary behavior that we are testing for is the correct behavior of retention logic. Two critical configurations for this behavior are <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#retention.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retention.ms</a></code> (retention according to time) and <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms</a></code> (hotset retention). See below for a visualization of how hotset retention causes a Tiered Storage based log to span the tiered set and the local hotset data. Our initial state generator will generate configurations for these settings and an initial state.<br>

</pre>
<h2 id="action-generator"><a id="action-generator"></a>Action generator</h2>
<p>The log property tests generate different sub-actions at various frequencies, ensuring that more common operations are performed more frequently in proportion to the number listed for each action. Descriptions of these actions will follow.</p>
<pre>Gen.frequency(
  (20, Append),
  (20, AdvanceHighWatermark),
  (20, Read),
  (10, AdvanceTime),
  (10, IncrementLogStartOffset),
  (10, TierUploadSegment),
  (10, RollSegment),
  (10, CommitTierState),
  (10, Retention),
  (10, TierRetention),
  (1, CloseAndReopen))
</pre>
<h2 id="append"><a id="append"></a><code>Append</code></h2>
<p><code>Append</code> generates a record batch of different record types, with a bounded range of timestamps and various compression choices. The generated record batch is then appended to the SUT log.<br>
The model state is updated to advance the log end offset and accumulate the records that have been appended.</p>
<pre>Action: Append(generatedRecords):

Generators:
CompressionType:
Gen.oneOf(CompressionType.NONE, CompressionType.SNAPPY, CompressionType.GZIP, CompressionType.LZ4)

Record:
timestamp &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](baseTimestamp, minTimestamp)
key &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))
value &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))

RecordBatch:
magic &lt;- Gen.oneOf(RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V0, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V1, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V2)
records &lt;- Gen.nonEmptyListOf(Record)
compressionType &lt;- CompressionType

SUT action:
log.appendAsLeader(generatedRecordBatch)

Model action:
activeSegment.append(generatedRecordBatch)
records.add(generatedRecordBatch)
logEndOffset = logEndOffset :+ generatedRecordBatch.size
</pre>
<h2 id="advancehighwatermark"><code><a id="advancehighwatermark"></a>AdvanceHighWatermark</code></h2>
<p><code>AdvanceHighWatermark</code> simulates the movement of the high watermark (HWM). In Apache Kafka, high watermark increases occur as follower replicas fetch data from the leader.<br>
The high watermark affects several behaviors of the log. For example, it dictates the upper bounds of allowable retention, segments eligible for tiering, and log start offset movement resulting from <code>DeleteRecords</code> API calls.</p>
<p>Due to how Apache Kafka performs offset translation, we limit high watermark movements such that they align with record batch base offsets or the log end offset. The reason for this will be discussed later.</p>
<pre>Action: AdvanceHighwatermark(newHighwatermark):

SUT action:
log.updateHighWatermark(newHwm)

Model:
hwm = newHwm
</pre>
<h2 id="rollsegment"><code><a id="rollsegment"></a>RollSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>RollSegment</code> forces a segment roll on the SUT’s log. This is necessary because we set <code>segment.bytes</code> and <code>segment.ms</code> to their maximum possible values, given that this logic is currently unimplemented in the model. When it is implemented, this action will no longer be required.</p>
<pre>Action: RollSegment()

Log action:
Log.roll()

Model:
Create a new empty active segment if the existing active segment is empty
</pre>
<h2 id="tieruploadsegment"><code><a id="tieruploadsegment"></a>TierUploadSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>TierUploadSegment</code> checks whether any segments meet the necessary conditions for tiering and then simulates an upload of the segment to object storage. The candidate segment must meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment must not be the active segment</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be greater than the log start offset</li>
<li>The segment is the first tierable segment that has not otherwise been tiered</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be below the high watermark</li>
</ul>
<pre>Action: TierUploadSegment()

Log action:
simulateUpload(firstTierableSegment)

Model:
tieredSegments.add(firstTierableSegment)
</pre>
<h2 id="committierstate"><code><a id="committierstate"></a>CommitTierState</code></h2>
<p>Tiered logs contain local state consisting of metadata for tiered segments. Confluent Server achieves safety of the overall log by preventing deletion of any local segment covered by tiered segments until after this state has been safely committed (flushed).</p>
<pre>Action: CommitTierState()

Log action:
log.tierPartitionState.flush()

Model:
committedEndOffset = tieredSegments.last.endOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="incrementlogstartoffset"><code><a id="incrementlogstartoffset"></a>IncrementLogStartOffset</code></h2>
<p>The <code>IncrementLogStartOffset</code> action simulates two behaviors in Apache Kafka. The first is when an application or user uses the <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeleteRecords</a></code>API to advance the log start offset. The second is when a leader has a higher log start offset than the follower, which will trigger the advance of the log start offset via the replication protocol.</p>
<pre>Action: IncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset: Long)
Generated:
newLogStartOffset &lt;- Gen.chooseNum(state.logStartOffset, state.highWatermark)

Log action:
log.maybeIncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset, ClientRecordDeletion)

Model:
logStartOffset = newLogStartOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="retention"><code><a id="retention"></a>Retention</code></h2>
<p><code>Retention</code> applies Apache Kafka’s local log retention to the SUT in the following order of application:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>retention.ms</code></li>
<li><code>retention.bytes</code></li>
<li>log start offset</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of log start offset retention, any segments lower than the log start offset will be deleted. The retention action must be careful not to delete any local segments that are not deletable due to data that has been tiered. For example, if any tiered segments past the start offset are not deletable, then any following local segments will not be deletable.</p>
<pre>Action: Retention()

Log action:
log.deleteOldSegments()

Model:
Apply retention time retention
Advance the log start offset if any local segments have been deleted
Apply log start offset retention
Apply hotset time retention
</pre>
<h2 id="tierretention"><code><a id="tierretention"></a>TierRetention</code></h2>
<p>The <code>TierRetention</code> action performs retention for the tiered portion of the log. <code>TierRetention</code> is similar to normal log retention, except it is responsible for deletion of the section of the log that has been tiered.</p>
<pre>Action: TierRetention()

Log action:
log.tierDeleteOldSegments()

Model:
Delete the first tiered segment if it is below the log start offset or if maxTimestamp &lt; currentTimeMs - retention.ms
</pre>
<h2 id="closeandreopen"><code><a id="closeandreopen"></a>CloseAndReopen</code></h2>
<p><code>CloseAndReopen</code> closes the log and reopens it. It is important to test the opening of the log as it re-initializes critical variables and may perform log <code>recovery</code> if the log was not closed cleanly. If the generated recover variable is true, the log will be forced to perform log recovery from the beginning of the log as if it were not closed cleanly. This rebuilds in-memory epoch and producer states from local segments rather than restoring them from checkpointed states on disk.</p>
<pre>Action: CloseAndReopen(recover: Boolean)

Log action:
log.close()
new Log(recoveryOffset)

Model:
No action
</pre>
<h2 id="read"><code><a id="read"></a>Read</code></h2>
<p><code>Read</code> performs a read of the log starting at an offset under a particular isolation mode. The offset affects the starting point of the read, and isolation action affects the data that is allowed to be returned by the fetch. For example, for <code>FetchHighWatermark</code>, only records below the high watermark are allowed to be returned.</p>
<p><code>Read</code> is implemented here as an action rather than as a property check for two reasons. The first is that checking every potential combination of <code>fetchOffset</code> and <code>isolation</code> after every action will be expensive. Secondly, reads can affect the behavior of the log by advancing high watermarks, triggering values to be …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>The title is a bit of a lie. I think Python is a good, practical, language, and relatively easy to learn and to teach. Its vast collection of libraries let you slap together a program to do virtually anything you want. It doesn’t have the beauty of APL or lisp, and certainly nothing like the speed or expressive power of Julia, but it’s a tool anyone can use to make something that solves a real-world, non-trivial problem in a day or two. And if you’re programming the kind of website that uses forms and a database, it has the Django web framework, which alone might be a good enough reason to learn the language.</p>
<p>For me, what sometimes makes Python a pain in the neck is that it is an “object oriented” language. These are not the awesome message-passing objects as they were originally envisioned and implemented in Smalltalk. These “objects” are class based, and are attractively outfitted with multiple inheritance. As an individual programmer, you never need to write a single class. I certainly don’t. I use Python as a functional language. I create a program from many small, composable functions acting on lists, tuples, and dictionaries. This is not a criticism. Python was designed in the 1980s, when most people thought that classes were the way to go. They may still be the best choice for certain types of problems, but now there is growing regret directed at the need to live with and maintain large systems built from piles of classes all keeping secrets and inheriting from each other.</p>
<p>My beloved Django is a good example. If I want to customize its behavior, I need to wander though a maze of magical framework code, and end up littering my own code with opaque references to <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> and <em>super</em> and <em>meta</em>. I don’t bother any more, and just write my own code to replace the parts of Django that I want to be different, bypassing larger and larger parts of the framework. Despite all this, Django is such a mature and solid piece of engineering that I am loathe to abandon it.</p>
<p>As I said, the power of Python is the ability to leverage its libraries, including the ones added by so many people over the years. And here is the problem for the user of the language who might want to avoid the class-based paradigm and write functional code. The libraries are written by real Python programmers, which means that they are object oriented. They often don’t mesh well with code written in the functional style, are a pain to modify, and do things you might not expect.</p>
<p>Here is a little example that, I hope, shows you some of what I mean. I needed to write a program that reads, parses, and writes bibtex files. These are plain-text databases of publications familiar to anyone who uses the LaTeX document preparation system. The database stores the bibliographic information about some list of publications; you just mention its location in your LaTeX document, and you can get citations and a reference section typeset in any style you need. Naturally, there’s a Python library for parsing bibtex: it’s called <code>bibtexparser</code>. Did I mention that there is a library for everything? That’s why we’re using Python. This library can read the file and parse it into a special object, the BibDatabase. This object has a property called <code>entries</code>; the <code>entries</code> is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the bibliographic information for one publication, with keys like <em>author</em>, <em>title</em>, etc. There is a special key called <code>ID</code> that uniquely identifies each publication. It’s chosen by the author as a mnemonic tag for use in citations. The documentation of this library is, frankly, not very good, and I had to experiment to see just how it works. I found that I could modify the <code>entries</code>, or delete from or add to the list, and my alterations were reflected when writing the new bibtex file back to disk. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The BibDatabase object has another way to represent the data. It has an <code>entries_dict</code> property, too, which is a dictionary of dictionaries. Each publication appears as a dictionary with a key that is the publication’s <code>ID</code>. In other words, it’s almost the same as the <code>entries</code> list, but with the data arranged a little differently. Instead of a list of dictionaries, it’s a dictionary whose values are dictionaries and whose keys are the <code>ID</code>s. This makes sense, and is the most natural way to represent this data.</p>
<p>At some point in my program, it became convenient to use the <code>entries_dict</code> version of the data rather than the <code>entries</code> view of it. I found that I could alter the contents of any of the dictionaries, and the changes, again, were faithfully preserved when I converted the BibDatabase into a file on disk. But then I tried to add a new publication by adding an entry to the <code>entries_dict</code> dictionary. The new publication did <em>not</em> appear in the output file.</p>
<p>The documentation was no help. I started reading the source code, and, no surprise, it was based on classes. Not transparent functions transforming data structures, but opaque classes with super-secret methods for doing everything. When the user asks for the <code>entries</code> or the <code>entries_dict</code>, or adds items to them, private code is run behind the scenes, as is common in class-based systems. These secret methods and <code>properties</code> add a publication to the object when you append to its <code>entries</code>, but not when you enlarge its <code>entries_dict</code>. It was easy to modify my code to take this into account. But I wished I had known about it in advance and not wasted an hour or two puzzling over it.</p>
<p>This is a typical Python library, and this is why using Python can be so annoying. If you want to use the library in a way a little differently from how its creator intended, you may trip over surprising behavior, and will have to wade through a maze (sometimes—this library happens to be quite simple) of class-based source code to figure out what all the secret methods are doing. It may be a matter of taste, but I find that using and understanding libraries in Clojure or Julia to be a refreshing contrast.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We are experiencing some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deadliest days</span></a> in American history, but the magnitude of the ongoing disaster defies human comprehension. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>These circles represent some of the deadliest days (from a single cause) in the last 100 years.</p>
<h4><strong><br>Declining Searches for “Cases” and “Deaths”</strong></h4>
<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

<h4><strong>American Deaths Will Continue to Go Unseen</strong></h4>
<p>These factors all play into our inability to fully comprehend and react to the Covid-19 crisis.

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

You pick up your phone to check the time or your to-do list, and the first thing you see is that you've received 9 messages from 4 different people, who are waiting for your response. Let’s start with an assessment.</p><h2>What is the state of play with notifications?</h2><h3>They capture our attention</h3><p>In 2015, researchers from Florida State University published <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.distraction" target="_blank">this study</a> on attention and phone notifications. Participants worked on an attention-demanding task on a computer, during which some received automated call or text alerts on their personal phones. As it turns out, those who received text notifications performed poorly compared to participants who didn’t. Those who received call notifications performed even worse than those who got text messages. Here’s the most interesting part: simply knowing that you have received a text or missed a call might impact your attention as much as actually using your phone. That’s because some of your focus is now allocated to remembering this notification that’s waiting for you.</p><h3>They get in our way</h3><p>Fast-forward to the 20’s. Today, push notifications may be the most obvious form of interruptions because they pop up on or slide into our screens ; but they’re not the only ones that cut off our flow. For instance, I would love to have Discord open, or to use Twitter, without having the constant reminder that I have things to catch up on. The notification badge, with or without count, disrupts our focus. If you open Twitter because you want to message someone, the badge immediately calls for your attention instead of letting you pursue the task you had in mind.</p><p>An alternative design could be one that lets you check your notifications whenever it suits you, making it a deliberate choice, by removing their constant presence on the homepage and keeping them contained to a dedicated zone. Dr. Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, and professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, uses <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids" target="_blank">this expressive comparison</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our attention is being captured by devices rather than being voluntarily regulated. We are like a sailor without a rudder on the ocean — pushed and pulled by the digital stimuli to which we are exposed rather than by the intentional direction of our own mind.”</em></p></blockquote><h3>What’s with the red?</h3><p>There’s also the issue of the colour. Many notification badges are <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-apples-notification-bubbles-are-so-stressful-65a544e51f10" target="_blank">red by default</a>. Red is the colour that stands out the most in our daily life. Whether in a city, in nature, or at home, this hue contrasts the best against any background. As a result, red is also consistently used to alert us of important signals, including in the physical world. By important, I mean “that which could have strongly negative consequences if we miss them”. The stop sign, the red light, the no-crossing light, the stove, the train’s emergency window breaker, the car dashboard’s red lights, and more, use red as a signifier.</p><p>So not only is red more striking, but we’re also conditioned to be particularly attentive to red signals. Now, I ask you: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red? I’m curious where your mind is at. I created a poll on Twitter, and you can vote below or <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937">over there</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.<br><br>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you\u2019re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p>\u2014 This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610456282977_18734"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.</p><p>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p></div>— This Too Shall Grow 🌱 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

We’re constantly being summoned: we switch between tasks and different platforms without dedicating appropriate levels of attention to each. In the example I mentioned above, you 1) open twitter.com, but before completing the “send message to friend” task, you 2) are prompted by the notification badge. So you 3) open the notifications panel, switching to a “read notifications” task. Some of them require a reaction from you, where you 4) switch to “post reply” or “like tweet”. Once you’re done going through this list, you 5) can finally return to your original messaging task.</p><p>“I have strong willpower, I would stick to the original task without checking my notifications”, you say? That’s great! Though as we’ve seen above, the niggling awareness of new information waiting for you is enough to impede your focus.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_15957"><div>

Take emails: a promotional newsletter from The Fork, or the LinkedIn announcement that someone you don’t know started a new job, are given the same importance as an email from your client saying they accepted your budget. Gmail tabs and inbox filters can help with that, but most email providers don’t have that kind of feature enabled by default. John Herrman, tech and media reporter, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html" target="_blank">eloquently written</a> about this topic:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I’ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while</em>.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“<em>The same badge might lead to word that Grandma’s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don’t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat. New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Here are some examples of irrelevant notifications:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Other people - whom I don’t know - commented on a post I’ve commented on</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_22192"><div>

None of the screenshots above concern me, yet LinkedIn decided on my behalf that having them in my feed wasn’t enough, but that I should also be notified of them.</p><h2>How are mindful notifications helpful?</h2><p>What are mindful notifications? Here’s my attempt at constructing a definition.</p><p>“Notifications are mindful when their mental cost and attention required are suitable to the information communicated to a given user. It enables them instead of hindering them. As much as possible, it’s signalling instead of interrupting.”</p><p>I asked people in the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank">Ness Labs community</a> to tell me about their relationship with notifications. Here’s what they shared:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I've turned most notifications off, entirely, especially sounds but also quite a few badges. This has increased my productivity and my equanimity. I find myself no less informed as a result. I am experimenting with widgets on my iPhone to surface the information I want convenient access to” - </em><a href="https://twitter.com/manleywalker" target="_blank">Manley</a></p></blockquote><p>I also found <a href="https://twitter.com/_middlesister" target="_blank">Karin</a>’s approach interesting. She has a feature phone for personal use, and a smartphone for her professional life only. On her smartphone, everything is off by default - including badges and sound - and she only allows a few selected apps to notify her. This mindset of starting with a clean slate and only turning on the relevant alerts helps ensure that she makes her digital life work for her, and not the other way around.</p><p>Another member mentioned she has no social media, and that she keeps her phone free from work emails and news apps. She can still log in to her personal emails and calendar if needed, but she purposefully added friction to make it a difficult and deliberate act.</p><h2>Designing mindful notifications</h2><h3>Managing the level of attention</h3><p>Dear designer, what’s it going to be? A mobile and/or desktop push notification? An email? An SMS? An in-app notification only? A blinking LED? A sound? A badge? A vibration? And chances are… a blend of those?</p><p>Designers have a range of signifiers they can use and potentially combine, to adapt to the appropriate level of attention required. Does it require users’ full attention, right away? Does it just need to be available for users when they want to retrieve that information? What's the worst case scenario if users miss the notification?</p><p>To be mindful of users’ attention, here’s what factors in:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>The urgency</strong>. “In 10 min: call with x person” lets you know that it’s time to finish your current task, take a short <a href="https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/better-breaks" target="_blank">break</a>, and pour yourself another tea before your meeting.</p></li><li><p><strong>The importance</strong>. “You have 2 months to fill in your income tax papers” isn’t urgent, but you certainly don’t want to miss that task. Thus, this information might not require a push notification, but it needs to stand out.</p></li><li><p><strong>The context</strong>. “Here’s your QR code ticket for train 1234, carriage 5, seat 6” is a very relevant …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>Developers and software teams already know that one of the biggest challenges of their job is <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/how-to-scope-software-projects">accurately scoping work</a>, and being able to consistently and predictably deliver results to clients within the promised timeline.</p>



<p>Yet another challenge is finding ways to streamline workflows so <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">missed deadlines due to inaccurate scoping</a> become 100 percent a thing of the past. Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are just a few metrics that software teams can track and optimize to boost their efficiency and productivity —&nbsp;but these are also metrics that are often confused with one another.</p>



<p>Each one of them —&nbsp;lead time, cycle time, and takt time — is an individual metric that helps developers monitor, track, and evaluate <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">how efficiently your team completes projects</a>. Optimizing each of them for better efficiency doesn’t only boost client satisfaction; it also makes your team better, faster, and stronger.</p>







<p>But doing that requires understanding what each metric is, how to calculate it, and the role it plays in the overall project scope. By understanding the differences between lead time, cycle time, and takt time — and how and when to use each metric —&nbsp;developers can discover paths to better scoping and increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Lead Time vs Cycle Time vs Takt Time: What Are They</h2>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time all come from Kanban, a workflow management method that was originally created to help streamline manufacturing processes. Many of the principles of Kanban translate well to the process of software development, so it’s become a common practice for managing workflows for software teams, as well.</p>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are all metrics used to track, measure, and evaluate efficiency at different parts of the production process. If that doesn’t make sense just yet, don’t worry —&nbsp;we’ll explain each one in better detail down below.</p>



<h3>What Is Lead Time?</h3>



<p>Lead time is the total amount of time between when a new task or project enters your workflow, and when it leaves your workflow. In other words, it’s the total time from when your team agrees to take on a project, to when you deliver it to the client.</p>



<h4>How Is Lead Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for lead time in a manufacturing setting is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Lead Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In the context of a software team, that might look like this:</p>



<ul><li>After the client makes a request that includes three deliverables, it takes your team two days to process it.</li><li>Then, it takes four months (~120 days) to complete the project.</li><li>Once the project is finished on your end, the client takes two weeks (14 days) to review it and make the final payment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>In this case, the lead time would equal 2 days + 120 days + 14 days, or 136 days.</strong></p>



<h4>Why Is Lead Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Lead time provides you with a good overview of how long a project takes from start to finish. You can compare your lead time to your cycle time to determine some insights about your team’s productivity and customer satisfaction, but more on that in a minute.</p>



<h3>What Is Cycle Time?</h3>



<p>Cycle time is how you can measure how long it takes your team to complete work on a project. In manufacturing, cycle time means the amount of time it takes to complete a production cycle from beginning to end. For software teams, that usually translates to the amount of time from when your team starts coding, to when the software is released.</p>



<p>Cycle time differs from lead time in that it measures <em>only</em> the time your team spends in production. Lead time takes that measurement, then combines it with the time it takes your team to receive and process requests, deliver them to the client, and receive approval and payment.</p>



<h4>How Is Cycle Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating cycle time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Cycle Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s take the same example from above, and calculate the team’s cycle time.</p>



<p>It took the team 120 hours to complete the three deliverables the client requested. So cycle time could be calculated in two different ways.</p>



<ul><li>120 hours divided by three deliverables = 40 hours of cycle time per deliverable; or</li><li>120 hours divided by one project for the client = 120 hours of cycle time</li></ul>



<h4>Why Is Cycle Time Important for Software teams?</h4>



<p>Cycle time is one of the most important metrics you can compare to your lead time, and how those two differ can tell you quite a bit about your team’s efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, if your cycle time is much lower than your lead time, it shows that your team is either taking a long time to process requests and begin projects, or projects are lingering in the approval phase. This could mean your team is leaving loose ends and not moving through the entire workflow efficiently.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your cycle time is equal to your lead time, it could be because you’re allowing processing and approval times on projects to overlap. While this might be an efficient use of your software team’s time, it may also lower the quality of the customer service you deliver.</p>



<h3>What Is Takt Time?</h3>



<p>And now, let’s look at time measurements from a different angle with takt time. Takt time is a measurement of how quickly or efficiently your team is able to meet the needs of your client or production schedule. “Takt” comes from the German word for “pulse,” and that’s a good way of looking at it —&nbsp;this measurement finds your team’s ideal “pulse” of work, that allows you to deliver projects as needed without underworking or overworking the team.</p>



<h4>How Is Takt Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating takt time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Takt Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This can be a little trickier to apply to work like software development (though that doesn’t make it a less useful metric!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the example we’ve been using above, we can take those three deliverables the client needs, and divide them into the 120 hours your team has available for the project. In that case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 3 = 40 hours per deliverable.</p>



<p>But we know software development isn’t always that easy to segment. So, to look at this another way, let’s say your team has scoped the client’s project and determined there are 6 smaller goals you need to achieve during your sprints. So in this case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 6 = 20 hours per sprint. That means your team can plan on completing two sprints per week to hit their optimal pulse, or takt, for this project.</p>



<h4>Why Is Takt Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Takt time tells you whether your team is overworked and unable to keep up with demand, or underworked and not being as productive as it could be.</p>



<p>For example, if you calculate your takt time to be 120 hours per project, but your team’s cycle time is 150 hours, your team won’t be able to deliver on the deadlines it’s scoping.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your takt time is 120 hours and your cycle time is 100 hours, you’re leaving 20 hours per project in your scope as wasted time.</p>



<h2>How Can You Measure Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Takt Time?</h2>



<p>We know time tracking <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">isn’t a favorite topic among developers</a>. But for getting the valuable insights that lead time, cycle time, and takt time can provide, it’s 100 percent necessary.</p>



<p>So why not use a time tracking tool that’s built into your existing systems, but stays in the background, out of your way while you do the job you’re here to do? <a href="https://www.7pace.com/">7pace Timetracker</a> is just that — it’s a time tracking tool built for developers, by developers who use it themselves. It integrates directly into Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">GitHub</a>, so no matter where and how you work, it’s always where you need it to be —&nbsp;tracking time so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>But we know we’re not going to sell you on a time tracking tool unless there’s real value your team can gain. That’s why it’s not so important <em>how</em> you track different time metrics —&nbsp;what matters is <em>why</em> you track them (and how you use the insights they give you).</p>



<h3>Why Should You Track All These Time Metrics?</h3>



<p>Tracking time metrics like lead time, cycle time, and takt time comes with a whole pile of potential benefits for your team. These metrics can:</p>



<ul><li>Help your team identify bottlenecks in your workflow;</li><li>Give you a better understanding of your team’s capacity for work;</li><li>Help you more accurately scope new projects.</li></ul>



<p>The most important takeaway here is that tracking different time metrics gives you a complete view of how your team is spending time. That allows you to identify any workflow problems, and identifying them is the first step toward eliminating them — and getting as close as possible to maximum productivity with your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note and recognize that time metrics will be constantly changing, so this isn’t a one-and-done kind of assessment. In order to keep getting the maximum value out of tracking time metrics, you’ll have to continue to track and analyze them over time, on all your projects —&nbsp;and adjust your workflow accordingly. Sometimes changes you put into place based on one set of time metrics will end up getting reversed later based on a newer set of time metrics — software teams are made up of people, after all, and not robots.</p>



<p>It takes some time and effort to constantly track time metrics, but we think the value of the insights you can gather makes the endeavor well worth it. If you’re ready to start tracking your team’s time metrics —&nbsp;from lead time to cycle time to takt time and even more — you need the time tracker that will automate the most tedious parts of the process.

From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

            </small></p><p><a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/">Ohm</a> is an open-source parsing toolkit for JavaScript which <a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/">Alex Warth</a> and I have been working on since 2014. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.</p>
<p>This article is not about Ohm itself, but about the <strong>Ohm visualizer</strong>, which I designed and built in 2015 while working on Alex’s team at CDG.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Later, the team expanded the visualizer into the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">Ohm Editor</a>, which we continued to actively develop over the years. The editor itself has been <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/live2016/">presented before</a>, so I’ll focus specifically on the visualization here.</p>
<p>Creating the visualization was one of the most difficult and interesting design challenges I’ve ever tackled — so it’s been rewarding to hear from people who have found it to be helpful:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey, I used Ohm for the first time a couple days ago.</p><p>I used to have an irrational fear of writing parsers.</p><p>Your visualization cured it.<br>Thanks a lot!</p></div>— Anselm Eickhoff (@ae_play) <a href="https://twitter.com/ae_play/status/1347325515770826757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></blockquote>


<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Ohm is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">parsing expression grammars</a> (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. Like other PEG-based tools, it uses <em>packrat parsing</em>, a form of top-down parsing with unlimited lookahead.</p>
<p>One of Ohm’s main goals is ease-of-use —&nbsp;not only for the end users of languages, but also for grammar authors. And debugging grammars can be a notoriously painful. So I designed and built an interactive visualization that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. This lets grammar authors <em>follow the flow</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> rather than “playing computer” and trying to simulate the execution in their head.</p>
<p>When creating or debugging a grammar, there are a few things you might be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parse succeeded…<ul>
<li>…what does the parse tree look like?</li>
<li>Did it parse the input the way I intended? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the parse failed, why did it fail?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, I explored two different design directions: one focused on the output (the parse tree), and another that focused on the algorithm execution. The big challenge was to come up with a design that could do both.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out all the examples here online in the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/">Ohm Editor</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Visualizing Parse Trees</h2>
<p>To visualize the parse tree, I chose a variant of the icicle plot (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685881?seq=1">Kruskal and Landwehr 1983</a>). Some people may be more familiar with the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> used in software profilers, which are basically inverted icicle plots.</p>
<p>Each node is represented by a <span>gray rectangle</span>, with its children directly below it. A <span>dashed bottom border</span> indicates a node with hidden children. You can click on a node to show or hide its children.</p>
<p>Unlike most icicle plots, the absolute width of a box is not meaningful — only its width and position relative to the input text. Nodes always sit directly below the input text they consumed.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This is emphasized by highlighting the relevant portion of the input when the cursor is over the node:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/arithmetic-parse-tree-hover.png" width="320px"></p>
<p>This means that the node must be at least as wide as its consumed input. We also ensure that the nodes are always wide enough to display the full label. So unlike most hierarchicial visualizations, there’s no need to hover over a node to see its label.</p>
<p>To satisfy both of these width constraints, the layout algorithm will expand the letter spacing of the input text where required:</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<h2>Visualizing the parser execution</h2>
<p>A parse tree visualization can help you understand what the parse tree looks like, but only if the parse succeeded. If the input failed to parse, or if the parse tree is not what you intended, you’ll want to understand <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, I designed the “explain parse” feature, which shows a visual explanation of the parser’s execution. This can be enabled via the option panel in the lower right corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-checkbox.png"></p>
<p>Like other PEG-based tools, Ohm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent parsing</a>. A useful property of recursive-descent parsing is that parser’s execution (e.g. as represented by a dynamic call graph) has a very similar structure to the parse tree. This made it possible to design a single visualization that serves both purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple grammar for parsing credit card expiry dates. The animation below shows a trace of the logical steps taken to parse the input “08/24”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-expiry.gif">
<figcaption>Stepping through the parse of “08/24”.<br><i>(click to replay)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see that the tree is built in a top-down, left-to-right manner. Each non-leaf node is visited twice: once on the way down, and again on the way up. This is the basic structure of recursive-descent parsing. </p>
<p>In this extremely simple example, every step taken by the parser succeeds. So the execution trace looks <em>exactly</em> like the parse tree. This is not usually the case. Let’s take a look at a more complex example:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>In this example, several steps in the parsing failed to match any input (shown with <span>red labels</span>). This doesn’t mean something went wrong — this is just part of the way that a packrat parser works. The screenshot above shows two different types of match failure that can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failed branches of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#alternation">alternation expression</a>, as seen under <code>idFirst</code>. The parser first attempts to match an underscore (<code>"_"</code>), which fails, before successfully matching <code>letter</code> on the second branch.</li>
<li>The last child of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#repetition-operators---">repetition expression</a>. The repetition expression <code>idRest*</code> means  to match <code>idRest</code> as many times as possible; the last attempt will always fail by definition.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/highlighted-failures.png"></p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>Another challenge in designing the visualization was how to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>. In a packrat parser, backtracking happens when a successful match is part of a larger expression which fails.</p>
<p>For example, many programming languages contain <em>keywords</em> (e.g. <code>function</code>) which can appear in the same position as a variable name. A common way to handle this is to use <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#negative-lookahead-"><em>negative lookahead</em></a> to prevent incorrectly matching a keyword at the beginning of an identifier like “functional”.</p>
<p>Here is the same grammar from before, modified to include a <em>functionKeyword</em> rule. And here is the visual explanation of matching the the input “functional”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/functional-parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>The nodes with a <span>pink background</span> are nodes which successfully matched some portion of the input, but were ultimately discarded during backtracking.</p>
<h3>Left recursion</h3>
<p>One thing in Ohm that’s different from many similar tools is its special support for <em>left recursion</em>. The <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">arithmetic grammar</a> included in the Ohm Editor has some examples of left-recursive rules:</p>
<pre><code>  AddExp
    = AddExp "+" MulExp  -- plus
    | AddExp "-" MulExp  -- minus
    | MulExp
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the first two branches of <em>AddExp</em> begin with a recursive application of <em>AddExp</em> itself — that’s left recursion. In a typical recursive-descent parser, this would result in infinite recursion. However, since it’s so convenient to define left-associative operators this way, the Ohm parsing algorithm detects these rules and handles them specially.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Ohm handles left recursion by iteratively trying to expand the input consumed by the left-recursive rule, and stopping when it can’t be expanded any further. As a grammar author, you might sometimes wonder why it stopped when it did. To find out, you can look at the special <span>[Grow LR]</span> node that appears as the last child of any left-recursive rule application:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/grow-left-recursion.png"></p>
<h2>Single-stepping</h2>
<p>One other feature of the visual parse explanation is the ability to single-step through the parser’s execution. In terms of information content, it doesn’t show anything that’s not already visible in the full visualization — so in a sense, it’s not strictly necessary. However, I hoped that it might help new users learn how the visualization works.</p>
<p>Single-stepping can be controlled through the buttons in the option panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-controls.png"></p>
<p>You can also right-click on any node and choose “step into” or “step out”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-into.png"></p>
<p>From there, you can use the arrow keys to step forwards (→) or backwards (←) through the logical steps of the parser execution:</p>
<figure>

</figure>



<p>As I explained at the beginning, my goal with the Ohm visualizer was <strong>to make entire execution of the parser visible and tangible</strong>. In the end, I think I was able to achieve that — but I’m sure there are also many aspects of the design that could be improved. If you have ideas, please feel free to get in touch!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DarkMarket, the world's largest illegal marketplace on the dark web, has been taken offline in an international operation involving Germany, Australia, Denmark, Moldova, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (the National Crime Agency), and the USA (DEA, FBI, and IRS). Europol supported the takedown with specialist operational analysis and coordinated the cross-border collaborative effort of the countries involved.</p>
<h3>DarkMarket in figures:</h3>
<ul><li>almost <strong>500 000 users</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>2 400 sellers</strong>;&nbsp;</li>
<li>over <strong>320 000 transactions</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>4 650 bitcoin</strong> and <strong>12 800 monero transferred</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the current rate, this corresponds to a sum of more than <strong>€140 million</strong>. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.</p>
<h3>Germany takes the lead</h3>
<p>The Central Criminal Investigation Department in the German city of Oldenburg arrested an Australian citizen who is the alleged operator of DarkMarket near the German-Danish border over the weekend. The investigation, which was led by the cybercrime unit of the Koblenz Public Prosecutor's Office, allowed officers to locate and close the marketplace, switch off the servers and seize the criminal infrastructure – more than 20 servers in Moldova and Ukraine supported by the German Federal Criminal Police office (BKA). The stored data will give investigators new leads to further investigate moderators, sellers, and buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Europol's involvement</h3>
<ul><li>Facilitated international information exchange.</li>
<li>Provided specialist operational support.</li>
<li>Provided advanced analytics that assisted the German authorities in identifying and tracking down the alleged administrator.</li>
<li>Supported Germany in coordinating the cross-border collaborative effort involving international partners.</li>
</ul><h3>Europol's Dark Web Team</h3>
<div><p>One of Europol's initiatives is to create a coordinated law enforcement approach to tackle crime on the dark web. This involves law enforcement agencies from across and outside the EU and other relevant partners and organisations, such as Eurojust.</p><p>
&nbsp;
To achieve this goal, Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a> has established a dedicated Dark Web Team to work together with EU partners and law enforcement across the globe to reduce the size of this underground illegal economy.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>It will deliver a complete, coordinated approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>sharing information;</li>
<li>providing operational support and expertise in different crime areas;</li>
<li>developing tools, tactics and techniques to conduct dark web investigations;</li>
<li>identifying threats and targets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The team also aims to enhance joint technical and investigative actions, organise training and capacity-building initiatives, together with prevention and awareness-raising campaigns – a 360° strategy against criminality on the dark web.</p>
<p>A shared commitment across the law enforcement community worldwide and a coordinated approach by law enforcement agencies have once again proved their effectiveness. The scale of the operation at Europol demonstrates the global commitment to tackling the use of the dark web as a means to commit crime.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Headquartered in The Hague, the Netherlands, Europol supports the 27 EU Member States in their fight against terrorism, cybercrime, and other serious and organized crime forms. Europol also works with many non-EU partner states and international organisations. From its various threat assessments to its intelligence-gathering and operational activities, Europol has the tools and resources it needs to do its part in making Europe safer.</p>

<article>
  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<![CDATA[Making VoIP Calls with Antique Rotary Phones]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>One of the worst parts of modern life is how <em>unsatisfying</em> it is to hang up on somebody. Tapping on the ‘End Call’ button on an iPhone or angrily clicking ‘Leave Meeting’ on Zoom just isn’t nearly as fun as slamming down the handset on a <em>real phone</em>.</p>
<p>This particular project was to breathe some life into the antique Northern Telecom phone from my grandparents’ house by attaching it to a modern VoIP system. This was surprisingly difficult, but very satisfying as the result is essentially a free ‘vintage’ landline for my home.</p>
<p><img src="https://nbailey.ca/images/nt500.jpg" alt="Northern Telecom model 500"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-phone">The Phone</h3>
<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-dialling">Pulse Dialling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/pulse-dialing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/">Photo Source: RF Wireless World</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/MultiTone1.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling#/media/File:MultiTone1.png">Photo Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/images/D/small%202-212.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converter.html">Photo Source: OldPhoneWorks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 15<sup>th</sup> of December, Ethiopian federal troops and Amhara militia approached the Mariam of Zion cathedral in the Tigrayan city of Aksum. It is possible that they thought that Tigrayan troops were sheltering in the church – taking advantage of the ancient right of sanctuary. According to a number of sources the church was full, with some saying that up to 1,000 people were in the building or the compound surrounding it.</p>
<p>The advancing soldiers caused consternation: a chapel in the compound is believed by Ethiopians to house the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Only a monk – appointed as its guardian – may see it. There was a huge commotion. Amhara soldiers are reported to have shouted that “the Ark belongs in Addis Ababa!” but this cannot be confirmed. Those inside the cathedral came out to try to defend the sacred object.</p>
<p>A confrontation ensued. Everyone in the compound was forced into the square outside the cathedral. As the crowd milled around, there was further shouting and the troops opened fire on the protesting crowd. As many as 750 people are reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>News of the massacre has only gradually reached the outside world. People walked over 200 kilometres to the regional capital, Mekelle, and from there the story gradually filtered out – despite the clamp-down on the media in Tigray.</p>

<p>News of the massacre follows confirmation by the Ethiopian authorities that one of the most sacred Islamic sites, the Nejashi Mosque in the town of Wukro, had been badly damaged in fighting.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.omanobserver.om/the-untold-story-of-king-negash-and-the-al-nejashi-mosque/">built</a> in the 7th century by the companions of the Prophet Mohammad, some of whom are buried at the site.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government accepts the damage took place, and promises to restore the building, which is one of the oldest mosques in the world.</p>
<p>The government say it was attacked after Tigrayan troops dug trenches around the mosque.</p>
<p>Independent journalists are being prevented from visiting the Tigray region – the site of a fierce conflict between Tigrayan fighters and Ethiopian and Eritrean troops, supported by Amhara militia.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><div><div><p><img src="https://gourav.io/gourav.png" alt="Gourav Goyal"></p></div><p>Dec 11, 2020</p></div><p>I use VSCode as my go-to editor for anything code. When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>
<!-- -->Out of Covid boredom, I decided to put a donate button to see what happens. I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

  <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">
    
    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a> 
for more information. Also, check out the samples <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples">here</a>.</p>

        <hr>
<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>
    <span>FOR</span> <span>i</span> <span>IN</span> <span>0..1000000</span> <span>loop</span>
        <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>'https://www.supercool-url.com/'</span> <span>||</span> <span>round</span><span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span> <span>^</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>text</span>
    <span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span>THEN</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>IF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 36 MB</span>
