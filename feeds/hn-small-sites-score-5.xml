<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>. Open-source projects protected by patents can prevent large organizations from stealing our project <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/" target="_blank">without due credit</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-product-name-i-need-to-trademark-it">I have a startup/product name, I need to trademark it</h3><p>Unless the startup/product has created value for its customers, so that a counterfeiter is using that startup/product name for forgery; trademarks for startup/product names are useless. Besides, in most countries just <a href="https://hitstartup.com/when-to-register-our-startup/" target="_blank">incorporating/registering our startup as a company</a> would prevent anyone else from using the same name for their company.</p><h3 id="trademark-automatically-applies-to-the-name-and-the-logo">Trademark automatically applies to the name and the logo</h3><p>Trademarking the name and logo are separate process namely wordmark and device mark respectively.

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4hs4K7AEvQ" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" alt="SimpleNetworkStarter">

      <figcaption>
          <p>SimpleNetworkStarter</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

      <figcaption>
          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</div>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</div>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>xchg</span>    <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>eax</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_relaxed:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>It seems that Microsoft has decided to pick up where Sega left off. Their offer? A system with familiarities appreciated by developers and online services welcomed by users.</p><p>Please note that, due to consistency with other sources, this article separates storage units between the metric prefix (i.e. megabytes or ‘MB’) and the standardised binary prefix (i.e. mebibytes or ‘MiB’), thus:</p><ul><li>1 MB = 1000 KB</li><li>1 MiB = 1024 KiB</li></ul><p>… and so forth.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>The processor included in this console is a slightly customised version of the famous <strong>Intel Pentium III</strong> (an off-the-shelf CPU for computers) running at <strong>733 MHz</strong>. With this, one can assume this console is just a PC behind the scenes… I won’t tell you the answer, but I promise that at the end of the article you will be able to reach your own conclusion.</p><p>Anyhow, Pentiums, along with other lines of CPUs designed and manufactured by Intel, were incredibly popular in the computer market. Such was Intel’s market share that they became the de-facto reference point for quality: As a typical user, if you wanted a good computer and had the budget, you only had to look for <em>something</em> carrying an Intel CPU. We all know by now that there are more factors involved, but that’s what the marketing guys at Intel managed to project.</p><h4 id="technical-information">Technical information</h4><p>Now that we positioned Intel in the map, let’s go back to the topic of this console. During my research, I was expecting to find documentation with the level of depth as other CPUs (MIPS, SuperH, ARM, etc), but instead, I stumbled across an excessive amount of marketing terms that only diverted my search. So, for this article, I came up with a structure to organise all the necessary information which will help to understand how this CPU works. Furthermore, I will try to introduce some terminology that Intel used to brand this CPU.</p><p>Having said that, let us take a look:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-branding-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-branding">Branding</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-the-isa-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-the-isa">The ISA</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture">The Microarchitecture</a></li><li id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc-link"><a href="#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">CISC or RISC</a></li><li id="tab-1-5-the-core-link"><a href="#tab-1-5-the-core">The Core</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-branding"><h4>Branding</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/branding.113be6f183d200764d7cfc590548c60fe637af1411fccff6cb274c99c9a5fa28.png"><picture>
<img name="image_cover" alt="Image" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/branding.113be6f183d200764d7cfc590548c60fe637af1411fccff6cb274c99c9a5fa28.png" data-src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/branding.113be6f183d200764d7cfc590548c60fe637af1411fccff6cb274c99c9a5fa28.png"></picture></a><figcaption>How is this study organised</figcaption></div><p>First things first, the Xbox’s CPU is identified as a <strong>Pentium III</strong>. So what does this mean? Back then (early 00s), the Pentium series represented the next-generation of CPUs. They were ‘new high-end’ that grouped all the fancy technology that made computers super-fast, plus it helped buyers decide which CPU they had to buy if they wanted <em>the best of the best</em>.</p><p>The Pentium III replaced Pentium II, which in turn replaced the original Pentium. Moreover, when the first Pentium came out, it replaced the 80486, which in turn replaced the 80386… You get the idea. What matters is that ‘Pentium’ is mainly a brand name, it’s not directly associated with its inner workings. Therefore, we must go deeper!</p><p>To dive further and not get lost in the way, I have catalogued the information into three sections which combined, make up the chip. The first the <strong>Instruction Set Architecture</strong> or ‘ISA’ (the group of instructions used to command the CPU), <strong>Microarchitecture</strong> (how is the ISA implemented in silicon) and the <strong>Core</strong> (what set of components are used to package the microarchitecture to form the specific CPU model).</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-the-isa"><h4>The ISA</h4><p>Indeed, after I mentioned the name Intel it was a matter of time before I introduce the famous <strong>x86</strong>, its instruction set.</p><p>Even though x86 first appeared with the release of the 16-bit CPU called <strong>Intel 8086</strong> in 1978, the ISA has been constantly expanded with more instructions as more Intel CPUs were released (80186, 80286 and so on). Consequently, x86 started to fragment as more ground-breaking features were added (i.e. ‘real mode’, vs ‘protected mode’ vs ‘long mode’). To tackle this, modern x86 applications commonly targeted the 80386 ISA (also referred as <strong>IA-32</strong> or <strong>i386</strong>) as a baseline, which among other things, operates in a 32-bit environment.</p><p>Subsequently, Intel presented enhancements of IA-32 in the form of <strong>extensions</strong>, meaning these may or may not be included in an IA-32 CPU. Programs can query the CPU to check if a specific enhancement is present. The Xbox’s CPU includes two extensions:</p><ul><li><strong>MMX</strong> (Multimedia Extension): Adds 57 SIMD instructions and 8 64-bit registers (integers only) that can speed up vector operations.</li><li><strong>SSE</strong> (Streaming SIMD extension): Another SIMD-type extension which addresses some of the limitations of MMX (lack of floating-point support and unable to use floating-point unit in parallel). It adds 8 128-bit registers (called ‘XMM’) that hold four 32-bit floats; and 56 new instructions.</li></ul><p>Good news is that since the console will always have the same CPU features, programmers can optimise their code to exploit these extensions as they will always be present.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture"><h4>The Microarchitecture</h4><p>When it comes to building a circuit that can interpret x86 instructions, Intel has come up with so many different designs for their CPUs. Some designs were featured with the release of a new Pentium Series (i.e. Pentium 4) while others are featured when Intel releases an ‘enhanced’ version of a Pentium (such as the ‘Pentium Pro’). Nevertheless, since the release of the first Pentium, the microarchitecture is identified with a different name from the CPU model. For example, the original Pentium includes the ‘P5’ microarchitecture.</p><p>Now, the Xbox CPU, along with the rest of Pentium III processors, use the <strong>P6 Microarchitecture</strong> (also known as ‘i686’). This is the 6th generation (counting from the 8086) which features:</p><ul><li>A <em>massive</em> <strong>14-stage pipeline</strong>.</li><li><strong>Out-of-order execution</strong>: If possible, the CPU re-orders the sequence of instructions to increase efficiency and performance.</li><li><strong>Speculative prediction</strong>: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">branch prediction</a>, but it also executes the branch that the CPU has predicted it will be chosen.</li></ul><p>Having said that, take a closer look at these features. It so happens they are very similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">previous consoles</a>, however, the other CPUs are very different in terms of design compared to Intel ones. Historically, one could argue that Intel could have never been able to accomplish, let’s say, a pipelined CPU. Yet they managed to do so, so let us see why…</p></div><div id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc"><h4>CISC or RISC</h4><p>All of the competitor’s consoles previously analysed contain a <strong>RISC</strong> CPU whereas Intel’s x86 ones are <strong>CISC</strong>. RISC CPUs are known for having a simplified instruction set compared to CISC CPUs. This includes, for instance, not featuring instructions that operate values directly from memory (as opposed to registers).</p><p>One of the advantages of RISC processors is that their simplistic approach enables its CPUs to be designed with a modular sense, which in turn can be exploited to improve performance with parallelism techniques. This is why we have seen CPUs like MIPS and PowerPC debuting pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, branch prediction, etc. On the other side, ‘CISC’ processors were design many years before the RISC processors appeared and aimed to solve different needs. Consequently, their designs are not as flexible as RISC ones.</p><p>Back to the original question, the P6 is an interesting design, because while the CPU only understands a CISC instruction set (x86), it interprets the ISA using <strong>microcode</strong> (called ‘micro-operations’) and the unit that executes that code is built around the guidelines of RISC. All in all, this allows Intel to apply the optimisations of RISC processors while keeping a ‘CISC layer’ for compatibility with x86.</p><p>Microcode is already embedded in the silicon but it can be patched, allowing Intel to fix its CPUs after production whenever a bug or a security vulnerability is discovered. If you have read previous articles (i.e. N64 or PS2), bear in mind that Intel’s microcode is <strong>not publicly accessible</strong> (let alone documented) and Intel is its solely ‘maintainer’.</p></div><div id="tab-1-5-the-core"><h4>The Core</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/core.63696b1d55e579495cbbb6e42a5ee66fe0ce7fee34e107f74c750a34546c309a.png"><picture>

Specifically, the Xbox includes one model called <strong>Coppermine</strong>. This was also released as the second revision of the Pentium III (replacing the ‘Katmai’ core) and includes the following components:</p><ul><li><strong>32 KiB L1</strong> cache: Divided between 16 KiB for instructions and 16 KiB for data.</li><li>Integrated <strong>128 KiB L2</strong> cache: This is <em>odd</em> since the off-the-shelf Coppermine has 256 KiB of L2. In fact, the Coppermine128 (found in the Intel ‘Celeron’ brand, the low-end Pentium alternative) has the same amount of L2. This is probably done to reduce manufacturing costs, and keep this console at a competitive price.</li><li>133 MHz <strong>Front-side bus</strong>: This is the bus that connects the L2 cache with the memory controller, we’ll see more about it later on.<ul><li>Intel names it ‘Front-side bus’ to distinguish it from another bus which connects the L2 (external cache) with the L1 (internal cache). The latter bus is called ‘Back-side bus’ and yes… It’s an unfortunate name to use from the UK.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Coppermine also features two ‘enhancements’ over their original implementation of L2 cache, these are the <strong>Advanced Transfer Cache</strong> and the <strong>Advanced System Buffering</strong>. To sum them up, L2 cache is on-chip and their buses are wider, which help to reduce possible bottlenecks found in the Front-side bus.</p><p>Finally, the chip uses the ‘Micro-PGA2’ socket to connect it to the motherboard, but like any other console, the Xbox has it soldered with a Ball Grid Array or ‘BGA’.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="p6-and-the-end-of-pentium-numbers">P6 and the end of Pentium numbers</h4><p>Here’s a bit more history: After the years of the P6, Intel planned to succeed it with the ‘Netburst’ microarchitecture (featured in the Pentium IV). However, the line of succession also ended there: The microarchitecture couldn’t be improved anymore. This prompted an Intel team in Israel to revisit the old P6 and develop a more efficient successor. The result was <strong>Pentium M</strong>, eventually extended to form the <strong>Core</strong> microarchitecture (and brand). ‘Core’ is the basis of present designs.</p><h4 id="motherboard-architecture">Motherboard architecture</h4><p>At some point in the history of the PC, motherboards grew so much in complexity that new designs had to be developed from the ground up to efficiently tackle new emerging needs.</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/motherboard.8ddd164202ef59296b376029d383dac1a91e08eea715a6596e1eefe61af1a160.png"><picture>

Following is a <b>list of mispronunciation glitches</b> that have been found so far. Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
</p><p>Note: Many of the mispronunciations from Sam are not in the <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Microsoft_Sam_(SAPI_4)" title="Microsoft Sam (SAPI 4)">Speakonia (SAPI 4) version</a> originally in Windows 2000, although there are some <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Speakonia" title="Speakonia">Speakonia</a>–only bugs.
</p>

<h2><span id="Word_Mispronunciations">Word Mispronunciations</span></h2>
<p>Most famously, regardless of version, Sam cannot pronounce the word "soy" (also the spelling "soi"), but instead will make a sound "swurghf", resembling a <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/ROFLcopter" title="ROFLcopter">helicopter</a> blade. In <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Speakonia" title="Speakonia">Speakonia</a> (SAPI 4), one can aid this mispronunciation by typing "soei", "s'hoy" or "Swoi" instead, and SAPI 5: "soe" or "ssoy". It doesn't happen in Mary and Mike, meaning this issue seems to be specific to the voice itself. However, he can say it correctly if you type a z after the S. He also says it correctly if a word is placed after it that begins with L or W, such as "soy like" or "soy wheat". Sticky Keys XP has also found an accurate way to make him say it correctly in Windows XP (SAPI 5). To do this, type "sse loi" (s'e loi in SAPI4). However, he says "soil" correctly.
</p>
<h3><span id="#"></span><span id=".23">#</span></h3>
<ul><li>6ix9ine: Microsoft Sam says "six-ix-nine-ine" in the SAPI4 version. He says "six-ix-nine-in" in SAPI5.</li>
<li>8bit: If you type this in a lot of times, Sam will sound like he is saying "8 billit" or "Bill Gates".</li>
<li>.exe - SAPI4 Sam will say "point eggs". He will say it correctly if spelled out. However, on SAPI5, he will say "dot eggs ee".</li></ul>
<h3><span id="A">A</span></h3>
<ul><li>Activision: Sam will say "Act-tiv-vis-see-on" in the SAPI5 version, but not in SAPI4. In Anna, a brief "wuh" is heard before Activision.</li>
<li>Adblocker: Sam, Mike, and Mary will say "ad bloker" in SAPI 4, while the SAPI 5 version pronounces it almost correctly as "adplocker". (Sam only).</li>
<li>Aeroplane: Sam pronounces it as "air-ah plane" in the SAPI5 version. He says it correctly in the Speakonia version.</li>
<li>AFK: Sam will mispronounce this in a somewhat different fashion with APC and APK.</li>
<li>Aight: Sam, Mike, and Mary will say "eight" (Both versions).</li>
<li>Airbus: Sam says it as "Airbess", but will say it correctly as two words. The SAPI5 version of Sam will say "orbis"</li>

<li>Aliens: Sam will say "ull-yens" in both versions. If you put a word before it, he will say it correctly.</li>
<li>Alioramus: Sam will say "ull-ee-o-remus". Said correctly if typed as "Alley o ramus" SAPI4 Sam says "ully-are-oh-mus"</li>
<li>Alt: Sam will say "Allt" in the SAPI5 version, but the Speakonia version says it correctly.</li>
<li>Altirhinus: Sam will say "All-turnus". He will say it correctly if typed as "Al tee ry nus"</li>
<li>Altaïr (as in Assassin’s Creed): Anna and Sam will say "Al-tire" in the SAPI5 version, but the Speakonia version says "Alter".</li>
<li>Always: Anna and Sam will say "al-wez" in Speakonia, but the SAPI5 version says it right.</li>
<li>Amiibo: Sam will say "em-yuh-eye-bo" in the SAPI4 version.</li>
<li>Andre: Sam says it "in-drei', unless there is a word before it. This happens in both SAPI4 and SAPI5. In order to fix this, type "Andray"</li>
<li>Andrea: Sam says it "indrea" unless there is a word before it. He says it correctly in SAPI5. In order to fix this, type "Anddrea"</li>
<li>Ana: Sam says "inna" in the SAPI4 version. Typing "anna" will be said correctly.</li>
<li>Anna: Sam says "inna" in the SAPI5 version. Typing "ana" will be said correctly.</li>
<li>Animax: Microsoft Sam will say "Ah-knee-macks" (but not in the Speakonia version).</li>
<li>Anime: Sam will say "Ow-nyme" in the SAPI5 version. He will say "anim" in Speakonia.</li>
<li>Animoji: Sam will say "An-im-uh-jee" in SAPI4.</li>
<li>APC and APK: Sam, Mike, and Mary will say "ack" in SAPI4 no matter if it's capital or not. This can be corrected by typing "AP C", "AP K". Their SAPI5 Counterparts will say "ack" if it's in all lowercase letters.</li>
<li>Arabic: Microsoft Sam will say "Erarbic" (This happens with the other Speakonia voices) SAPI5 Sam will say "ah-ra-beak".</li>
<li>Arceus: Sam pronounces it as "Ar-seus". When he pronounces the r, it sounds like he's blowing a raspberry before saying "seus".</li>
<li>Are: Sam will say "war" Putting a second r makes him say "lar" in Speakonia.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande">Ariana Grande</a>: Sam, Mike, and Mary will say "Airiana Grand" in SAPI4. Their SAPI5 Counterparts pronounce the Grande right, but not the Ariana.</li>
<li>Armadillain - They will say "Armadillayn". Type "Armadillun" to make them pronounce it correctly. SAPI5 Sam will say it correctly.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Lessons learned building a profitable algorithmic trading system using Reinforcement Learning techniques.</p><div id="post-content"><p>About two years ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">little piece</a> about applying Reinforcement Learning to the markets. It was a project I had worked on for a while in various forms. A few people asked me what became of it. So this post covers some high-level things I've learned. It's more of a rant than an organized post, really. If there is enough interest in this topic I'd be happy to go into more technical detail in future posts, but that's TBD. Please let me know in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/dennybritz">Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Over the past few years I've built around four and a half trading systems. The first one was a pile of crap. The second one I never finished because I realized early on that it was also a pile of crap. The third one was abandoned for personal and political reasons. The fourth one worked extremely well for 12-18 months. Then, profits started decreasing and I decided to move on to other things and I lacked the motivation to go back into it. Some of the systems I worked on were for the financial markets, but the last one was applied to the crypto markets. So keep that in mind while reading.</p>  <p>If you've taken some economics classes your first thought is perhaps something like</p> <blockquote> <p>Ha, newbie! Efficient Market Hypothesis! E!M!H! You can't beat the market! It's all just luck!</p> </blockquote> <p>And I would say that most economic theories like the EMH are so far removed from the real world that they don't matter. This doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. They are interesting academic models that can be useful in certain contexts, like for writing papers or getting prizes. But they don't survive confrontations with a messy real world and emotional human beings. If you have no idea what the Efficient Market Hypothesis says then you are in luck - sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. I won't get into it here because you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9bYOBuKF4">smarter people</a> arguing about this. Suffice to say, I strongly believe and have seen myself that you can build profitable systems that consistently beat the market. Will the market eventually adjust to take away that opportunity? Probably, but that's irrelevant, because the market may take months, years or decades to adjust (just look at HFT), and you are free to evolve your system over time, looking for new opportunities and adjusting to the adjusting market yourself. That was the case for me. The market seemed to have adjusted to my system as profits started decreasing, but it took more than 12 months, and with the right motivation I probably could have adjusted and improved the system to work again.</p> <p>Rather than thinking about markets from an economics perspective, I prefer to think about them from a Game Theory or Reinforcement Learning perspective. <strong><strong>The market does not exist.</strong></strong> What people call the market is an emergent property of many agents acting in an environment trying to maximize their own objective. The objective may be slightly different for everyone. Some want to sell shares they obtained through a stock options plan at a good price. Some engage in arbitrage for quick profits. Some try to predict short-term movements based on news or charting patterns. Some engage long-term speculation based on fundamentals. Some are designated market makers providing liquidity for a specific asset or exchange in return for a fee. Each could be a human acting on gut feeling and emotion, a human following some kind of implicit fuzzy algorithm (e.g. charting), or an automated system acting on data. The combined behavior of all these agents gives rise to this illusive thing that people call <em>the market</em>. Your goal isn't to beat the market, it's to beat some of the other players in the market over a time horizon you care about. The time horizon part is important. Not every trade has a clear winner and loser, because agents are optimizing over different time horizons, ranging from microseconds to decades.</p>  <p>If you come from a tech or startup background, transitioning to trading may require a change in thinking. Products and engineering are often about <strong><strong>absolutes</strong></strong>. If your website takes 100ms to load that's pretty good. Making it load in 99ms provides negligible benefit to the end-user. It'd be a waste of engineering resources. The same is true for startups. Paul Graham likes to say that startups are rarely killed by competitors. Rather, they commit suicide. They fail because they cannot find customers, don't have a solid business model, or because of founder issues. Being killed by competition with a slightly better product is quite rare.</p> <p>Trading is different. It's about <strong><strong>relatives</strong></strong>. It's fine if your website takes a horrible 10 seconds to load if your competitor needs 11 seconds. Having crappy data is fine if everyone else's data is even crappier. Paying high trading fees is fine if everyone is paying the same. This is pretty obvious if you look at the market as a multiplayer game. Even if you're a bad player on an absolute scale, you can win if your competition is worse. This has direct effects on how you build software to trade in the markets.</p>  <p>What a focus on relative performance means for engineering can be quite counterintuitive.</p> <p>When building infrastructure for a product-based company you would prefer using battle-tested, robust frameworks that minimize risk. Why re-invent the wheel if someone else has already built it? It's safe to use something that has been adopted by thousands of people. This is where open source shines. Using AWS for hosting your server? Postgres for storing your data? JSON for serialization? Python or Node for data collection? An open source library for calling APIs? Download Keras and train a NN on your data? Reasonable ideas, but when you are building trading infrastructure, you should think twice about these.</p> <p>Widely adopted technologies are commodities. If you use the same technologies as everyone else, where will your advantage come from? When building a product this doesn't matter because it's about absolute SLAs. But trading is about relatives. <strong><strong>Each commoditized technology you can specialize and build yourself is an opportunity</strong></strong> to beat the competition. By being hybrid cloud you can reduce latencies. By storing data in an efficient binary format you can save serialization time, leading to faster iteration during development, and faster predictions in production. By creating custom integrations with exchanges instead of using off-the-shelf APIs you may be able to use specific order types that are not available to others, or gain an informational advantage by processing exchange-specific information. And so on. Building highly-specialized non-generic systems is what engineers hate. We love generalization and abstraction. But specialization is often where your advantage in trading comes from.</p> <p>You don't need to start from scratch and implement your own programming language to start trading. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs you are making when adopting commoditized technologies. Make conscious decisions about it. Some of the things above seem minor - but a large number of tiny advantages can add up to a significant edge.</p>  <p>You may say, well, this makes sense, but I really don't want to compete on the infrastructure side. Instead, I want to build a smarter model that makes better predictions. That's my edge! I've heard this a LOT, and I've never seen it work.</p> <p>AI is pretty commoditized. I would say it's more commoditized than excellent infrastructure engineering, data collection, or inductive biases from domain knowledge. These days, you can easily download state-of-the-art models and run them on your data. Unless you are at the forefront of some extremely relevant research, it's unlikely that you can gain a significant edge just from training a better model.</p> <p>When people realize that their fancy AI model built on crappy infrastructure trained with crappy data (that's also used by everyone else) doesn't work, they give up. AI can give you an edge, but not an edge so huge that it allows you to ignore other factors. You still need to build good infrastructure, get good data, have decent latencies, and so on. Few people seem to be willing to spend time on these unsexy things. Think of each as a multiplier. If one is close to zero, it doesn't matter how good your AI model is.</p> <p>So, what are some these other things?</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Market</strong></strong> - Pick the right market(s) to trade in. Don't go for the obvious choices that everyone is picking by default. The harder it is to get access to a market, both legally and technically, the more likely that you will find opportunities. Less liquid markets may be overlooked by sophisticated funds because they don't scale to their AUM. Again, this is often counterintuitive to engineers who go for "good APIs" - good APIs typically mean popular. Popular typically means commoditized.</li> <li><strong><strong>Data</strong></strong> - Think about data sources that others do not have access to, or are not willing to get. For example, there may be data that's difficult to crawl due to sophisticated rate restrictions IP bans. Most people will give up here. This is an opportunity for you. Be skeptical of popular APIs and open source software. It's the same data that everyone else uses.</li> <li><strong><strong>Latencies</strong></strong> - You're probably not planning to compete with HFT traders (bad idea), but that doesn't mean you can completely ignore latencies. Better latencies will probably lead to easier execution with less slippage. Be careful about where you host your systems, how you send data around, how you serialize data, and so on.</li> <li><strong><strong>Models</strong></strong> - In general, better data is more important than better models, but better models can also give you an edge. Note that you are often trading off model complexity with latencies.</li> <li><strong><strong>Execution</strong></strong> - A good model doesn't mean much if you can't execute. Historical data you collect may look quite different from what's actually happening on the exchange. You are not going to know until you start live trading.</li> </ul>  <p>More than two years after my <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">last post</a>, do I still believe that …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/zoom-child.jpg" alt=""></p>

<section data-level="1" id="zoom-treats-you-like-a-child">
<p>Deeply ingrained in Zoom's defaults are choices that do not encourage us to expect the best from each other.  We spend such vast amounts of time in video meetings now that we should question what behaviors our platforms are driving us to, and how they affect our interactions with our friends, family, and colleagues at work.  </p>

<section data-level="3" id="-waiting-for-the-host-to-start-the-meeting-"><h3>"Waiting for the host to start the meeting"</h3>
<p>This message can be infuriating.  The host is on vacation, or they're in a car somewhere, or they're there but having trouble logging in.  Or worse, everyone wonders, who <em>is</em> the host of this meeting, anyway?  Is it me?  Am I holding us back at this moment?  For God's sake, when will we be able to get on with the actual work we have to do?</p>
<p>And really, why can't we just carry on without the host?  Of course if you go into all the right admin screens and click all the right buttons, you can turn this off, but since it is the default, this experience inevitably creeps in.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="may-i-please-share-my-screen-pretty-please-"><h3>May I please share my screen?  Pretty please?</h3>
<p>I have a thing on my screen that's relevant to our discussion right now.  Can I share my screen?  Oh, well, no because someone else is sharing <em>their</em> screen, and for some reason now I have to find a moment to interject and ask them if they would stop so that I could share my thing.  Or maybe it's not worth all of that so I'll just keep it to myself.  Yes, there is a setting again somewhere that can undo this constraint, but defaults are rarely changed.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="could-we-please-mute-this-person-making-a-ruckus-"><h3>Could we please mute this person making a ruckus?</h3>
<p>Try as we might to avoid it, we all at one point or another end up being this person making a ruckus.  If the host happens to be mid-sentence making a brilliant point, the last thing anybody wants is to derail the meeting so they can pause and find the right little mute button to click.  Shouldn't we all just be able to do it?</p>
<p>And really, why shouldn't it go the other way too -- if we see someone is muted and obviously meaning to speak to the group, do we all really need to figure out who is noticing this and who is going to yell "you're muted!" back at them?  And then they have to apologize, and figure out what they need to repeat, etc, etc.  More derailing.  What if anyone could just unmute anyone else and we all just trust each other to do the right thing?  That is the world I want to live in.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="-the-host-has-ended-the-call-"><h3>"The host has ended the call"</h3>
<p>In my younger days, at the bar, I used to get offended when last-call would come, and they'd kick everyone out.  Staff who had been friendly now changing course and telling everyone to please hurry up and GTFO.</p>
<p>These days, I can't help but see the parallel experience in leaving a zoom call.  I have to time my exit so that it's after the meeting is sure to be wrapping up, but before I get kicked out by the host.  Worst is when I'm reaching for that button to leave the call, but the host wins the race and I get booted before I can click.  Every time, I think, "Yeah, well, I was already leaving..."</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="how-about-something-different-"><h3>How about something different?</h3>
<p>We built Team.Video over the last while with some of these frustrations in mind.  Anyone can come and go as they please.  The group can collaboratively manage mute states.  Everyone can share their screens if they like.</p>
<p>And in those first moments joining a call, instead of making everyone wait on their own, we have a little game people can play together while everyone is getting settled.  I suppose that is also treating you like a child in a way -- prompting you to play a game.  But I'll happily choose that version where we use play to spur our imagination and make a tiny little bit of a connection before getting into the hard work at hand.</p>
<p>Check out what we've put together at <a href="https://team.video/">https://team.video</a></p>

The factors here will provide you with a framework for assessing the options.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/c8ec6b9dd94ccc54bc9ba7e8520fa1cd89f69758-2440x784.png" alt="Image of a comparison grid" title="Three Key Factors"></p><h3>The size of your community</h3><p><strong>Starting from scratch (or close to it)</strong></p><p>In the early stages of a community’s life, it’s important for the organizers to build strong connections with the first handful of members, since early adopters are more likely to join discussions, answer questions, and contribute in ways that make the community seem active and vibrant. Chat is good for this. Scalability and governance are less of a concern at this stage.</p><p><strong>Hundreds of community members</strong></p><p>At this point, chat platforms can start to feel unmanageable for a few reasons. First, moderation becomes an issue, since it’s hard for a small group of community managers to keep up with the volume of conversations happening (Discord beats Slack on this point).</p><p>Second, most community members complain that, on chat platforms, they often answer the same question or address the same concern many times over. The conversations just disappear too quickly for others to easily find, and since they’re not indexed or perma-linked, it’s difficult to reference previously answered questions.</p><p><strong>Many thousands of community members</strong></p><p>For large, well-established communities, forums are often the right choice, since live chat is difficult to manage and large scales.</p><p>Discourse provides fine-grained permissions and moderation that large communities will appreciate. Additionally, since large communities create lots of content, they especially benefit from indexed and shareable content.</p><h3>The size of your team</h3><p>Your choice of community platform should take into account your team’s ability to manage multiple channels, their timezone availability, and the number of folks available to interact on your chosen platform—all of which are a function of the team’s size.</p><p><strong>Small teams</strong></p><p>Small teams tend to start with a single platform, since that’s what they can manage given their bandwidth. In general, teams of three or smaller should commit to a single platform to focus their time and keep overhead low.</p><p><strong>Medium teams</strong></p><p>These teams are more self-sufficient compared to small teams and won’t need to depend as much on other teams for support. They <em>may</em> be able to handle multiple platforms, but often choose to go deeper with a single platform, such as more clearly defining roles and responsibilities within the team, and designating team members to focus on specific parts of the platform.</p><p><strong>Large teams</strong></p><p>Larger teams can handle multiple platforms and different sub-communities, such as a Slack for your MVPs and a Discourse forum for everyone else—but doing so introduces substantial overhead in terms of process management, identity resolution, and governance. That said, larger teams inside bigger companies tend to be better equipped to plan for and manage these situations.</p><h3>Your community’s engagement model</h3><p>What are the behaviors and norms you want your community members to model? Are you hoping for a casual vibe where members can congregate, discuss, and debate? Or are you more interested in cultivating deep knowledge sharing and collaboration? Once you decide, <strong>you should factor your engagement model into your tool choice</strong>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/People-Powered-Communities-Supercharge-Business/dp/1400214882"><em>People Powered</em></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonobacon">Jono Bacon</a> outlines three engagement models that we think are useful to consider when choosing a platform:</p><p><strong>Consumers</strong></p><p>These communities revolve around <strong>ephemeral and emergent discussions about common interests</strong>, and emphasize connection based on those topics. Examples include communities about art, gaming, or general technology trends.</p><p><strong>Champions</strong></p><p>In this engagement model, <strong>community members share knowledge and insights about a common tool or technology, with an emphasis on leveling-up one’s expertise and experience</strong>. Members often teach each other through demos and examples, driving further participation from other community members.</p><p>Examples include company-specific communities, like the <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> Slack group, where members share custom CSS and browser extensions as well as how-to videos to share their knowledge and help others excel.</p><p><strong>Collaborators</strong></p><p>In communities of collaborators, members work together on shared projects. <strong>The primary example is open source software</strong>, where diverse people from around the world work together to build and improve a common codebase.</p><h2>Comparing Slack, Discord, and Discourse</h2><p>In addition to the key factors above, it’s important to understand the actual feature set each platform offers. The grid below assumes features for the baseline plans for each platform, and includes call-outs when features are offered only on paid tiers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/aff197588f79ad746695aefe4c436e90b1aa904b-1220x3044.png">›› View the full image</a><br><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dzello/image/upload/v1590534477/orbit/Slack-Discourse-Discord-Comparison-Primary-Orbit.pdf">›› Download the PDF</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/aff197588f79ad746695aefe4c436e90b1aa904b-1220x3044.png"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/f20e76ce60b8edd5151f05d8668c5df3e5efc971-1220x3044.png" title="Table Comparing Slack, Discord, and Discourse"></a></p><h2>Detailed Recommendations</h2><p>We’ll now look at detailed recommendations based on the key factors and the pros and cons of each platform.</p><p>Of all the factors to consider, <strong>we think a community’s engagement model should have the most influence over which platform is used</strong>, so we’ve organized this section along those lines with caveats for size of community and team.</p><h3>Consumer communities</h3><p><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Discord</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong></p><p>Casual communities should lower the barrier to involvement and focus on building close connections between users. For those reasons, we suggest using Discord.

        <p>Natively Cloud Native</p>
        <p><strong>Version:</strong> </p>
    </div>
    





<p>Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.</p>
<p>Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.</p>
<p>Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build JVM applications including:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With Micronaut you can build Message-Driven Applications, Command Line Applications, HTTP Servers and more whilst for Microservices in particular Micronaut also provides:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed Configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Discovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP Routing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client-Side Load Balancing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast startup time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced memory footprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of proxies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No runtime bytecode generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy Unit Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Historically, frameworks such as Spring and Grails were not designed to run in scenarios such as server-less functions, Android apps, or low memory-footprint microservices. In contrast, Micronaut is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.</p>
<p>This goal is achieved through the use of Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html">annotation processors</a>, which are usable on any JVM language that supports them, as well as an HTTP Server and Client built on <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a>. In order to provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, these annotation processors precompile the necessary metadata in order to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a low-memory environment.</p>
<p>Many of the APIs within Micronaut are heavily inspired by Spring and Grails. This is by design, and aids in bringing developers up to speed quickly.</p>

<h2 id="whatsNew"><a href="#whatsNew"></a>1.1 What's New?</h2>




<p>Micronaut 2.0.0 includes the following changes:</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_core_features">Core Features</h3>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_jdk_14">Support for JDK 14</h4>
<p>Micronaut has been updated to support JDK 14.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_groovy_3">Groovy 3</h4>
<p>Micronaut now supports applications written in Groovy 3.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_startup_performance_improvements">Startup Performance Improvements</h4>
<p>Startup time has been further improved in this release with typical startup time for a new application around 20% faster.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_improvements_to_bean_introspections">Improvements to Bean Introspections</h4>
<p>Bean introspections have been improved to support static creator methods, interfaces and enums. This means you can define a bean introspection on an interface with a private implementation such as:</p>
<div>
<p>Introspections on interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">import io.micronaut.core.annotation.Creator;

@io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected
interface Example {
    String getName();

    @Creator
    static Example create(String name) {
        return () -&gt; name;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_analyzing_the_injection_point">Support for Analyzing the Injection Point</h4>
<p>Micronaut’s Dependency Injection implementation has been improved such that you can now receive an <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/inject/InjectionPoint.html">InjectionPoint</a> instance to any <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html">@Factory</a> method. This makes it possible to customize how the bean is created based on the annotation metadata at the point at which the bean is injected.</p>
<p>For example consider the following definition:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Inject @Client("http://foo.com") RxHttpClient client;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A factory method can receive the injection point and create a client based off of the value:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Bean
protected DefaultHttpClient httpClient(InjectionPoint&lt;?&gt; injectionPoint) {
    String url = metadata.stringValue(Client.class).orElse(null);
    if (url != null) {
        return new DefaultHttpClient(url);
    } else {
        return new DefaultHttpClient();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_eager_initialization_of_beans">Support for Eager Initialization of Beans</h4>
<p>Eager initialization of beans is useful in certain cases, such as on AWS Lambda where more CPU resources are assigned to Lamdba construction than execution. Therefore as for Micronaut 2.0, you can specify whether you want to eager initialization configuration or all singletons using the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/ApplicationContextBuilder.html">ApplicationContextBuilder</a> interface:</p>
<div>
<p>Enabling Eager Initialization</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.build(args)
            .eagerInitSingletons(true) <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
            .mainClass(Application.class)
            .start();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Setting eager init to true initializes all singletons</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to just eager init configuration using <code>eagerInitConfiguration</code> which will initialize all <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/ConfigurationProperties.html">@ConfigurationProperties</a> beans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_spot_bugs_instead_of_jsr_305_nullable_nonnull_annotations">Spot Bugs Instead of JSR-305 Nullable/NonNull Annotations</h4>
<p>In Micronaut 1.x the Google distributed JSR-305 annotations library (<code>com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305</code>) was used to specify <code>@Nullable</code> and <code>@NonNull</code> on interfaces of the Micronaut API using the annotations contained within the <code>javax.annotation</code> package.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that JSR-305 has been cancelled and that this dependency has potential licensing issues (by using the <code>javax</code> namespace) as well as problems with the cross packages on Java 9+ with the module system Micronaut 2.x switches to the <code>spotbugs-annotations</code> module provided by the <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs project</a>.</p>
<p>It is recommended users of Micronaut use this API instead (although the <code>javax.annotation.Nullable</code> and <code>javax.annotation.NotNull</code> annotations continue to be supported).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_cli_features">CLI Features</h3>

<div>
<h4 id="_micronaut_launch">Micronaut Launch</h4>
<p>Create Micronaut 2.0 applications without having the CLI installed using <code>curl</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl https://launch.micronaut.io/demo.zip -o demo.zip
$ unzip demo.zip -d demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>


</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_diff_command">Diff Command</h4>
<p>Run <code>mn feature-diff --features=[FEATURE NAME]</code> from the root of another Micronaut project to create a diff of the changes that need to be applied to enable the feature. For example:</p>
<div>
<p>Using <code>feature-diff</code></p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mn feature-diff --features=azure-function

<div>
<h3 id="_graalvm_improvements">GraalVM Improvements</h3>
<p>Micronaut’s support for GraalVM Native Image has been moved out of experimental status, which solidifies our commitment to continue improving support for native images.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_automatic_static_resource_detection_for_native_image">Automatic Static Resource Detection for Native Image</h4>
<p>It is not longer necessary to configure static resources for your Native Immage builds. The <code>micronaut-graal</code> annotation processor will automatically do this for you for all resources found in <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_improved_support_for_jdbc_hibernate_in_native_image">Improved support for JDBC / Hibernate in Native Image</h4>
<p>It is no longer necessary to provide additional GraalVM related configuration to connect to databases via JDBC or Hibernate/JPA. Micronaut includes automatic support for the following drivers with GraalVM Native Image:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oracle</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_http_2">Support for HTTP/2</h4>
<p>Micronaut’s Netty-based HTTP client and server have been updated to support HTTP/2.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#http2Server">HTTP/2 documentation</a> for more information on how to enable support for HTTP/2.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_threading_model_and_event_loop_group_improvements">Threading Model and Event Loop Group Improvements</h4>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 uses a new shared default Netty <code>EventLoopGroup</code> for server worker threads and client request threads. This reduces context switching and improves resource utilization.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#clientConfiguration">HTTP Client Configuration</a> section for information on how to configure the default <code>EventLoopGroup</code> and add additional `EventLoopGroup’s that are configured per client.</p>
<p>In addition, as of Micronaut 2.0 all operations are by default executed on the <code>EventLoop</code> and users can optionally use the new <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/scheduling/annotation/ExecuteOn.html">@ExecuteOn</a> annotation to specify a named executor to execute an operation on if required (for example to offload blocking operations such as interactions with JPA/JDBC to a specific thread pool).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_code_requestbean_code">Support for <code>@RequestBean</code></h4>
<p>It is now possible to bind the properties of a POJO argument to a <code>@Controller</code> to request parameters, headers and so on using the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/RequestBean.html">@RequestBean</a> annotation.</p>
<p>Thanks to Github user <a href="https://github.com/asodja">asodja</a> for this contribution.</p>

<span># Generate and install a local CA</span>
mkcert <span>-install</span>
<span># Create a new certificate</span>
mkcert <span>-key-file</span> key.pem <span>-cert-file</span> cert.pem localhost
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now you can use the SSL key and cert for your local server. For instance, if you have a Jekyll blog, you can use the following command to serve on HTTPS</p> <div><div><pre><code>jekyll server <span>--ssl-cert</span> ./cert.pem <span>--ssl-key</span> ./key.pem
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, you can browse your local Jekyll site on <a href="https://localhost:4000/"><code>https://localhost:4000</code></a>! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p> </div></div>]]>

<p>We all want to write less code, but get more done.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we build our components so they can be reused more than just once.</p>
<p>Some components only need basic reusability.</p>
<p>Others need far more complex techniques to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I've identified 6 different levels of reusability, but there may be more that I've missed.</p>
<p>Here is a basic overview of the levels. My upcoming course, <em>Reusable Components</em>, explores each one and how to get the most out of them.</p>
<h2 id="1-templating">1. Templating</h2>
<p>Instead of copy + pasting code around everywhere, with this technique we wrap it up inside it's own component.</p>
<p>When we reuse the component —&nbsp;and not the code directly —&nbsp;it gives us two benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making changes in the future is much easier to do, since we only have to do it one place</li>
<li>We don't have to remember the dozens (or hundreds) of places we've copied that code to</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the most basic, and most often talked about form of reusability.</p>
<p>But the higher levels get a lot more interesting...</p>
<h2 id="2-configuration">2. Configuration</h2>
<p>With some components we'll need to have variations on how they work.</p>
<p>A <code>Button</code> component might have a primary version, as well as an icon-only version. But instead of creating entirely new components for each of these versions, we use props to switch between the different types.</p>
<p>Adding in these props doesn't usually add much to a component, but gives us far more flexibility in how that component can be used. Neat-o.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is different than using props for state or data, such as a <code>loading</code> prop or a <code>disabled</code> prop.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-adaptability">3. Adaptability</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with configuration is lack of foresight. You need to anticipate future needs and build them into the component by putting in those props.</p>
<p>But if you make your component <em>adaptable</em>, it can allow for use cases that were never even thought of — without needing to change the component.</p>
<p>We do this by passing a chunk of markup from the parent to the component using a slot.</p>
<p>For example, instead of using a <code>text</code> prop in a <code>Button</code> component, we can use the <code>default</code> slot:</p>
<pre>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span>
    <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>btn btn--default<span>"</span></span>
    <span>@click</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>$emit('click')<span>"</span></span>
  <span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<p>Now we're not limited to just passing a <code>string</code> or <code>number</code> in.</p>
<p>If we wanted to add in a <code>loading</code> spinner without having to modify our <code>Button</code> component, we can do that:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span>
      <span>v-if</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>loading<span>"</span></span>
      <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>spinner.svg<span>"</span></span>
    <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    Click Me
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<h2 id="4-inversion">4. Inversion</h2>
<p>Instead of passing a complete chunk of markup to our child component, we can pass a set of instructions for <em>how</em> to render.</p>
<p>This is like following a recipe instead of ordering takeout. When you follow a recipe it's a little more work, but you have total control over what you're making. You can tweak things as you go, or throw out the recipe altogether.</p>
<p>We use scoped slots to add even more flexibility to our components.</p>
<h2 id="5-extension">5. Extension</h2>
<p>With Adaptability and Inversion we have the necessary techniques to maximize the reusability of our components.</p>
<p>The next step is to apply these techniques all throughout our component so we can more easily extend it's behaviour.</p>
<p>We use named slots to add in one or more extension points in our component. Where Adaptability and Inversion on their own only give us one option to extend behaviour, having multiple extension points gives us many different options.</p>
<p>Here we have a <code>Modal</code> component with a <code>header</code>, <code>default</code>, and a <code>footer</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>modal<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>header<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{{ title }}<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

    
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>footer<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>Button</span> <span>@click</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>closeModal<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        Close
      <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<p>This is a fairly simple example of Extension, but we already have several options for extending this component:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just override the <code>default</code> slot to add in our content</li>
<li>Add in content but also override the <code>header</code> slot</li>
<li>Content and just the <code>footer</code> slot to add different buttons</li>
<li>Content and both <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> slots for something more custom</li>
</ol>
<p>(We <em>could</em> add more if we didn't use the <code>default</code> slot, but that's unlikely here)</p>
<p>You don't have to extend the behaviour of this component, or you can extend parts of it. Either way, you get a lot of flexibility and a lot of code reuse.</p>
<h2 id="6-nesting">6. Nesting</h2>
<p>We'll take Extension to it's conclusion by passing these extension points through one or more layers of components.</p>
<p>It may sound crazy at first, but it's extremely useful, especially in medium to large applications.</p>
<p>You start with a base component that's fairly general in what it does. The next component is a little more specific, extending the base component in a few ways. Then on and on until you have the final component that does the real work.</p>
<p>It's exactly how we go from a very general <code>Animal</code> to a more specific <code>Mammal</code> and then <code>Dog</code> and eventually land on a <code>Poodle</code>. If all we need is a <code>Poodle</code> component, we're wasting our time here, but in large applications we need lots of variations on the same basic idea.</p>
<p>We can extend the <code>Dog</code> component to get a <code>Corgi</code> and a <code>Beagle</code> component. Or extend the <code>Mammal</code> component to get a <code>Cat</code> component, which lets us then add in <code>Tiger</code> and <code>Lion</code> components.</p>
<p>This is the most advanced application of reusability that I have come across. I use this technique <em>a lot</em> in my own work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the 6 levels of reusability that I've come across.</p>
<p>I might have missed some, and I certainly wouldn't say that this is an exhaustive list, but it's complete enough to be useful.</p>
<p>A short article like this doesn't do them justice, but I go into them in much more depth in my upcoming course, <a href="https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components">Reusable Components</a>.</p>

June 26, 2020 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7519)</a> that defines a way to provide information within a JSON object between two parties. This standard is intended to help transmit information securely, but no standard or technology will protect you when used improperly.</p>
<p>To identify what can go wrong when using JWT in Node.js, I performed a security review on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a> modules that use the most popular JWT libraries. Using static analysis tooling, I examined 2,000 npm modules for security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This post summarizes some common mistakes that were found during my research, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded secrets</li>
<li>Allowing the <code>none</code> algorithm for signing</li>
<li>Missing or incorrect token validation</li>
<li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to describing these issues so you can avoid them, this post includes open source rules that make it easier to either manually audit your code bases to detect them, or include in CI so these vulnerabilities never get merged into your code in the first place.</p>
<h2>Hardcoded secrets</h2>
<p>The most basic mistake is using hardcoded secrets for JWT generation/verification. This allows an attacker to forge the token if the source code (and JWT secret in it) is publicly exposed or leaked.</p>
<p>Not only does this introduce a vulnerability, it’s also considered a software anti-pattern. You should keep your JWT secrets apart from your code, for example, in separate configuration files or environment variables.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"hardcoded-secret-here"</span><span>;</span> 

<span>class</span> <span>JwtAuthentication</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span>obj<span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a popular way to use JWTs is within other libraries, e.g., through <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passport</a>, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> JwtStrategy <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>Strategy<span>,</span>
    ExtractJwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>ExtractJwt<span>;</span>

<span>var</span> opts <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    secretOrKey<span>:</span><span>'hardcoded-secret-here'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span>

passport<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>JwtStrategy</span><span>(</span>opts<span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>jwt_payload<span>,</span> done</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though this is a known and quite obvious issue, it’s still common to use hardcoded secrets while developing and then accidentally leave it in your codebase. Fortunately, it’s also very easy to find hardcoded secrets with SAST tools, especially with <a href="https://semgrep.live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, which helps to find complex code patterns with rules that are very simple to write.
Rules for detecting hardcoded secrets:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret</a></p>
<h2>Allowing 'none' algorithm for signing</h2>
<p>Allowing tokens to have the 'none' algorithm was <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/#Meet-the%E2%80%94None%E2%80%94Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a critical vulnerability</a> some years ago. Nowadays, most popular JWT libraries do not allow decoding or verifying tokens with the None algorithm without explicitly enabling it. The same as with hardcoded secrets, it’s easy to leave ‘'none'` in your codebase after testing or debugging.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"some-secret"</span><span>;</span>
jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>"token-here"</span><span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span> algorithms<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"RS256"</span><span>,</span> <span>"none"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, if you forget to remove it after messing with code, it’s also very easy to catch it with Semgrep.
Rules for detecting ‘none’ algorithm allowed in your code:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<h2>Not verifying tokens the right way</h2>
<p>Sometimes developers rely on their methods of token verification instead of using built-in API, or omit verification completely.
Small wonder that usually it introduces the opportunity for attackers to forge information inside the token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>checkToken</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>token<span>,</span> refreshToken<span>,</span> key</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>refreshToken<span>,</span> key<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>token<span>)</span><span>.</span>param <span>===</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>refreshToken<span>)</span><span>.</span>param<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note: only <code>refreshToken</code> is verified in the example above, which gives an opportunity to attacker to manipulate function results. By changing value of <code>param</code> property stored inside <code>token</code> an attacker can force the result of <code>checkToken</code> function to be <code>true</code> and pass the verification.</p>
<p>On top of that, it’s very typical to get certain data from tokens before verifying it (issue date, id, etc.) and then use it as a verification context. Usually it’s harmless, but only if this data does not go any further. If the information from an unverified token is passed to other parts of the code it may introduce a vulnerability.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>function</span> <span>checkToken</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> issuer <span>=</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>token<span>)</span><span>.</span>issuer<span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>findIssuer</span><span>(</span>issuer<span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>token<span>,</span> key<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"not valid token"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>findIssuer</span><span>(</span><span>iss</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>(In the example above, the unverified <code>issuer</code> value is passed to another function before validating the token (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection</a>). If not used carefully it may end up in different kinds of injection vulnerabilities, especially if located in separate parts of the codebase.)</p>
<p>Also do not forget that even if a token is verified properly, the data stored in it should be treated as user input and be validated and sanitized according to the context.</p>
<p>Rule that helps identify lack of token verification:</p>

<h2>Sensitive data exposure</h2>
<p>When an object is converted to a JWT token without explicitly breaking it down into parts, it’s very easy to lose control of what is inside the object and disclose some sensitive information.</p>
<p>This is a very widespread mistake while using ORM libraries like Mongoose, Sequelize, etc. ORM models do not include any sensitive data at the moment of creation, but when the situation changes it is very easy to forget that the ORM object is also passed to JWT token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> mongoose <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'mongoose'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>

<p>Needless to say, you should not keep sensitive data in JWT token intentionally.</p>
<p>Helpful Semgrep rules:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data</a></p>

<p>These are the most common mistakes developers make when using JWT in their Node.js projects. Stay secure and don’t forget to automate security scans in your codebase.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The transition from Intel to Apple Silicon Macs is a huge deal, but some are
lamenting this shift as a loss to developers, especially those who rely on
virtualization such as Docker. The concern is that under x86 emulation instead
of hypervisor, the performance hit could be significant.</p>

<p>As the case may be, my take is the issue wouldn’t be that serious, while the
upside for developers is huge, especially for those who primarily develop
for Apple’s ecosystem. And if my hunch is correct, that ecosystem will expand
to server-side soon enough. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I’m a huge fan of Docker, and I’m a ML practitioner working
primarily on server-side within Linux, so I’m very familiar with the importance
of the development machines being consistent as server-side. Funnily enough,
I’d say this is the biggest rationale for Apple going ARM for Macs, which is to make
the development environment <em>exactly the same</em> as their deployment targets, namely
iOS, iPadOS, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and soon, MacOS.</p>

<p>That is to say, the current situation is that Xcode development is done on x86,
emulated in x86 simulators, and re-built for ARM for device deployment.
This has been the
state since the first iPhone and Apple has done a superb job maintaining the
seamlessness of this process ever since (as far as I know),
but more edge cases are beginning to crop up.</p>

<h3 id="edge-case-or-tentpole">Edge Case or Tentpole?</h3>

<p>From my narrow view of ML, the one I experience is the lack of emulation of
Apple’s Neural Engine (ANE) for accelerating model inferencing. Once a model
is compiled to Core ML, the emulator would execute the model on CPU and possibly
GPU, but its behavior is different on device when offloaded
to ANE. It’s not only a performance difference, but also floating point
differences and possibly quantization nuances.</p>

<p>What this means is to truly test a ML model’s behavior on Apple devices, one
has to deploy to actual devices, likely via a cable to enable debugging. As you
guessed it, this also means that you’d have to have multiple physical devices
if one is to test against different models. Multiply this with different iOS
versions to test against, it quickly gets out of hand. If Apple wants to
(and likely plans to) add more custom hardware, the situation is untenable
for both Apple and its developers.</p>

<h3 id="virtualized-apples">Virtualized Apples?</h3>

<p>With ARM (and other custom silicon) on the development machines,
we already know iOS apps will run
natively so there’s no need for emulators. I wouldn’t be surprised if these
apps are running within individual virtualized instances, to as closely as
possible create the same behavior as actual devices. Apple could go as far
as virtualize the hardware resources and capabilities so performance would
be emulated faithfully also, greatly simplifying the
development, testing, and debugging process for developers.</p>

<p>For ANE, this switch will be huge. People have had to deal with “numerical
differences” when running ML models on CPU compared to ANE, a process that
is slow to debug via tethered devices.
With the Mac having the same hardware as the target devices,
there’s consistency and no hidden surprises.
Whenever the development cycle is shortened and
opaque differences removed, it’s a good thing.</p>

<p>What about the downside of Docker becoming 2 to 5x slower without hypervisor?
While that is indeed a downside, I’d argue that for local Docker instances,
they are better used for functional testing and not part of
the core development cycle.
Coming from the Python world, I have had no problems developing software in native OS
and only use local Docker for validation prior to deployment. The other main
use case for Docker of bringing up server clusters locally would be slower, but again, shouldn’t be core
part of the development cycle. There’s always the option for remote Docker or
even better, deploy to sandbox and integration environments for testing.</p>

<h3 id="armed-cloud">ARMed Cloud?</h3>

<p>That brings me to the last point about the ARM transition for Macs, which is
the aspect of developing for server-side, not an area of focus for Apple.
However, if Docker and virtualization needs are primarily for server-side
development, and to be consistent of being consistent, the problem of x86
emulation can be dealt with if Apple offers ARM-based cloud servers. Having this
uniformity would truly enable developers to write code on their ARM Macs,
test across devices locally, and deploy to iOS devices and server-side, all from one code base,
without translation, emulation, or hidden gotchas. Pretty sweet landscape for
Apple developers if you ask me.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>Ever since I bought my Titanium MacBook Pro many years ago, I have been a fan
of Apple’s combination of software and hardware, but more importantly, its
long term approach to their product developments. This ARM Mac transition
has been long in the making, and I, for one, am excited again to buy an
ARM MacBook and the future it’d usher in.</p>

I would be lucky if I got a hit and got 1,000 plays on one of my songs. It was labour intensive. </p><p>Now algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly send 1,000 new listeners every week without any work on my part. This is amazing. Cold outreach sucks. It sucks for the artist and it sucks for the bloggers. Spotify deserves a lot of credit for here. </p><h3>3. Songs Matter, Not Albums</h3><p>Spotify's algorithmic playlists rank songs— not albums. It's just like in SEO: Google indexes pages, not websites. </p><p>This has elevated the importance of songs and made albums more irrelevant than ever— especially for small artists like me. (Of course famous artists like Drake and Billie Eilish can still get massive press from an album release— but most artists are not at that level of fame.)</p><p>These days it’s almost always better to release individual songs rather than albums.

Some of the most iconic releases in popular music have been albums. </p><p>… But things change and that’s okay. Plus I think asking listeners to listen to a full-length album don’t make sense in our attention-starved world. Asking listeners to listen to a single song might just be a more realistic ask. </p><h3>4. Human Editors Still Matter— Just Not How You Think</h3><p>The secret to getting your music on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly is to get on <em>human</em> playlists first. </p><p>It’s similar to SEO: playlists are like backlinks. When a song is added to a playlist it's a vote for the quality of the song. Not every playlist is equally authoritative though— just like how a link from The NY Times is more authoritative than other links in SEO.  </p><p>On Spotify, the most authoritative playlists are <em>editorial</em> playlists. These are  playlists curated by official Spotify editors. <strong>In my experience, it’s only when I get on an editorial playlist that my songs get heavily featured on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-d2618bdb9eb6fca6fb0b"><div>

I've been on editorial playlists 16 times but I have no idea how to replicate that.  </p><p><em>Note: In my experience, major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists. This is discouraging— if major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists, they’ll also get better placement in algorithmic playlists… But major label artists also only typically get 13% - 20% of streaming royalties… so there are still plenty of reasons to stay indie! </em></p><h3>5. Algorithms Make For Looser Relationships Between Artists And Listeners</h3><blockquote><p><em>"Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity." - David Bowie</em></p></blockquote><p>My most popular song 'Circles' has been played 1,350,00 times. And every month about 65,000 people listen to my music on Spotify. </p><p>Guess how many people follow me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevebenjamins/">on Instagram</a>? 480. </p><p>Just because people listen to me on Spotify, doesn’t mean they want a deep relationship. Most listeners just add 'Circles' to their library and move on with their life.</p><p>I’m definitely okay with this. I’d rather listeners follow me on Spotify rather than Instagram anyways. Plus only good things can come out of de-coupling fame from music. Make music because it’s what you love to do— not because you want to get famous. If you want to get famous I think you’re better off as a Youtuber or Tiktok influencer anyways! </p><p><strong>I think this is just the nature of algorithmic playlists— they lead to a high volume of listeners with a very loose connection to you as an artist:</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-a901b06fafc5a15411fa"><div>

The Deepest Relationships Happen When Listeners Share Music With Friends</h3><p>Listeners sharing music among their friends leads to the deepest connections in my experience. </p><p>For example: last month I was interviewed on a college radio station by three guys. I was blown away by how closely these guys  listened to the music. They knew it so well and had spotted lyrical themes that I’ve repeated throughout songs that I thought I only noticed. It was clear there was a very deep connection.  </p><p>Hearing from listeners like that is nourishing in a way that a graph on Spotify just can't be.  It can be a very moving experience.</p><p>I’ve had similar experiences when high school students reach out to tell me everyone in their circle is listening to the music. Somehow they seem to just care about the music more— like their shared interest draws them deeper. </p><p>When you spend most of your time in an algorithmic world of music streaming, it can feel like magic when you meet listeners who found your music through friends.

<p>In April/May of 2010, I spent four weeks as a freelance writer for The Onion News Network.</p>
<p>Besides looking great on a resume, it was an awesome gig and a huge learning experience. Not surprisingly, I get asked about it pretty often.</p>
<p>So here's everything I know about how to get a job writing for <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a>, and what I learned from my (short) time doing it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="howigotajobfreelancewritingfortheonion">How I Got a Job Freelance Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>Getting a job writing for The Onion is not easy. But there's no big secret to it, either.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/jobs">The Onion has a jobs page</a> on their website.</p>
<p>Yep. That's the big story behind how I got hired to write for The Onion: I went on their website and applied.</p>
<p>But here's the thing -- I did this at least twice with no luck before I got accepted.</p>
<p>Here's how it worked back then:</p>
<p>I would check the job listings frequently (obsessively), and every once in a blue moon, there'd be a position on there called Freelancer or Freelance Writer. You'd send in an email with your resume and samples, and they'd send back an application for you to complete. You had to return two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A list of 20 headlines</strong> and concepts for video sketches. (All the job listings I ever saw were for The Onion News Network -- their video leg. I never saw anything for editorial positions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A completed script</strong> for one of their news segment sketches based on ideas or concepts they provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, I went through this process (the final product is often known in the industry as a "packet") at least twice with no success. It doesn't sound like much, but it is TOUGH. I labored over those 20 headlines like you wouldn't believe. Even the best ideas start to look like shit after you've stared at them for a week.</p>
<p>And the scripts. Man, those were hard. They never gave you blockbuster concepts to work with, and I think that was on purpose. It was always some kind of dry, subtle joke -- they wanted to see what you could do and how far you would take it.</p>
<p>But the third time I applied was a charm. I'll never forget opening my email and seeing these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Onion News Network would like to congratulate you on being selected as a Contributor for the IFC series. We had a huge number of applicants, and we are thrilled with how strong this group is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember texting my wife -- girlfriend at the time. She was in class and stepped into the hall to call me. We both basically screamed on the phone for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Side Note:</strong> I haven't seen any writing positions listed on The Onion's website in years. Granted, I don't check as frequently anymore, but I think the only way to get in with them these days is to be recruited, know someone there, or come up through the ranks as an intern or writer's assistant.</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to get a job writing for The Onion; email them. I've heard stories of people that have done this. They say they won't take anything unsolicited, and there's a 99% chance they won't, but who knows? Serendipity just might strike for you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatitwasliketowritefortheonion">What It Was Like to Write for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>They put us to work right away. This was back in 2010, and The Onion was going into pre-production on its very first TV show -- The Onion News Network on IFC (The Independent Film Channel).</p>
<p>It would be a lot like the Onion video content we knew and loved, except in a half hour format and with recurring anchors as characters.</p>
<p>We were required to turn in 25 ideas a week; an "idea" being a headline or concept along with a short explanation of the joke and how the segment would play out.</p>
<p>Some weeks, we'd get really brief feedback on our lists. Other weeks, not. Then, by mid week, they'd compile all the ideas they liked. Some would be marked down as "one liners", or jokes that would be pulled in to scroll across the bottom of the screen during the show. Others were segmented by where in the show they might fit in, with some of them designated to move to the scripting stage (where the staff writers would take over).</p>
<p>The process moved fast. My job, along with the other freelancers, was to come up with ideas. We weren't really consulted or informed about anything else surrounding the show. No meetings to discuss casting. No phone calls to brainstorm around our jokes. It was our job to pump out creativity and let the full time staff filter everything out. Everything was done over email.</p>
<p>In the end, only one of my ideas actually made it into the show -- unless I missed a one-liner somewhere along the line, which would be easy to do.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the idea of mine that made it to production was one from my submission packet -- I'm pretty sure it's the reason they hired me. And they actually chose to open the entire series with it, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I recorded the pilot when it aired and probably watched it a dozen times with my family. One of the coolest moments I've ever had as a writer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatilearnedwritingfortheonion">What I Learned Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>This was a huge learning experience for me in a very short amount of time. I could probably talk for days about everything I learned working as a writer for The Onion for four weeks, but if I had to boil it down, here's what I'd say:</p>
<h3 id="ideasarecheap">Ideas are cheap.</h3>
<p>Or, in their case, jokes. They made us come up with so many sketch ideas and headlines. Huge lists of them. And once they were dead, they were dead. There was no reusing ideas that didn't quite make the cut in previous weeks. No iterating on almost-there jokes. When an idea was rejected, it was time to move on. Always bigger and better jokes, or ideas, out there to be found.</p>
<p>I also learned how to really dig into an idea to see if it had any potential. They were constantly pushing us to see past the headline. Is it just a funny sentence or is there room to explore and expand this into a 3 minute sketch? Is there substance?</p>
<h3 id="creativityisamuscle">Creativity is a muscle.</h3>
<p>What I loved about The Onion's writing process was the sheer volume of it. 25 ideas a week. No excuses. Often times, I'd turn in more than 25, along with a big list of one-liners I knew weren't big enough for full sketches. For one thing, it forced me to dig deep and get past those first initial ideas that came easily. It also helped me learn The Onion's editorial voice through repetition, which is something that can't be overstated.</p>
<h3 id="iamnotthatfunny">I am not that funny.</h3>
<p>I had one great idea and I used it up in my application to get the job. I wrote a few other funny jokes throughout, but nowhere near the level of The Onion's top writers. I wish I could show you these lists of approved ideas I got in my inbox each week. Reading through them was an absolute blast; these guys and girls are so freaking talented and funny.</p>
<p>At the end of the project, they opted to keep a few of the freelance writers on -- alas, I was not one of them. And I didn't expect to be. To be a professional humor writer, you have to be insanely funny and creative. I'm a good writer, and I got their voice, and I have a few good ideas, but I was never going to make it as a full-time writer for The Onion. And that's okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="intheend">In The End</h2>
<hr>
<p>Writing for The Onion was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had, and I feel lucky to have gotten the opportunity.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to see an idea I had sitting in my living room acted out on TV with a real script, real actors, and real production value. That was awesome, and I'll never forget it. And to top it off, I actually got a paycheck. People paid me real money to come up with jokes. That was incredible.</p>
<p>And I'd like to think that, even though the gig was short lived, I learned a ton by being bold enough to jump into the deep end with pro comedy writers.</p>
<p>Even if I didn't really belong there.</p>

Considering the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">vast number of different databases</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/types/relational/comparing-sql-query-builders-and-orms">variety of tools</a> for working with them, this is an extremely ambitious goal!</p><p>We are thrilled to enter the next chapter of pursuing this goal with a <strong>$12M Series A</strong> funding round led by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amplifypartners.com/">Amplify Partners</a>. We are especially excited about this partnership as Amplify is an experienced investor in the developer tooling ecosystem and has led investments for numerous companies, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a>.</p><hr><h3 id="our-mission-making-databases-easy"><a href="#our-mission-making-databases-easy" aria-label="our mission making databases easy permalink"></a>Our mission: Making databases easy</h3><h4 id="database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms"><a href="#database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms" aria-label="database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms permalink"></a>Database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms</h4><p>Despite having been developed in the 1970s, relational <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases">databases</a> are still the most commonly used databases today. While <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">other database types have been developed in the meantime</a>, from <em>document</em>, to <em>graph</em> , to <em>key-value</em> databases, working with databases remains one of the biggest challenges in application development.</p><p>While almost any other part of the development stack has been modernized, database tools have been stuck with the same paradigms for the last decades.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/WwMdROo.png"></span></p><p>When working with relational databases, developers have the choice of working directly with SQL or using a higher-level abstraction called ORMs. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/why-prisma#problems-with-sql-orms-and-other-database-tools">None of these options is particularly compelling</a>.</p><p>Using SQL is very low-level resulting in reduced developer <em>productivity</em>. In contrast, ORMs are too high-level and developers sacrifice <em>control</em> over the executed database operations when using this approach. ORMs further suffer from a fundamentally misguided abstraction called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">object-relational impedance mismatch</a>.</p><h4 id="prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases"><a href="#prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases" aria-label="prisma modernizes how developers work with databases permalink"></a>Prisma modernizes how developers work with databases</h4><p>Similar to how React.js modernized frontend development or how Serverless invented a new model for compute infrastructure, <strong>Prisma is here to bring a new and modern approach for working with databases</strong>!</p><p>Prisma's unique approach to solving database access with a <em>generated</em> query builder that's fully type-safe and can be tailored to any database schema sets it apart from previous attempts of solving the same problem.</p><p>A big part of the modernization comes from our <strong>major focus on developer experience</strong>. Database tools are often associated with friction, uncertainty, painful hours of debugging and costly performance bottlenecks.</p><div><p><strong>Developer experience is part of our DNA at Prisma.</strong> Working with databases is too often associated with friction and uncertainty when it should be fun, delightful and productive!</p></div><p>We want to make working with databases <em>fun</em>, <em>delightful</em> and <em>productive</em> while guiding developers towards proper patterns and best practices in their daily work with databases!</p><h4 id="learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases"><a href="#learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases" aria-label="learning from our past from graphql to databases permalink"></a>Learning from our past: From GraphQL to databases</h4><p>As a company we've gone through a number of major product iterations and pivots over the last years.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/4YPWyaW.png"></span></p><p>Our initial products, Graphcool and Prisma 1 were focused on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as a technology. However, as we were running both tools in production, we realized they didn't address the <em>core</em> problems developers had.</p><p>We realized that a lot of the value we provided with both tools didn't necessarily lie in the quick provision of a GraphQL server, but rather in the fact that developers didn't need to manage their <em>database workflows</em> explicitly.</p><p>This realization led to a pivot which ultimately manifested in the rewrite to Prisma 2. With this new version of Prisma, we have found the right level of abstraction that ensures developers keep full control and flexibility about their development stack while not needing to worry about database workflows!</p><h4 id="inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-"><a href="#inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-" aria-label="inspired by the data layers of big companies twitter facebook  permalink"></a>Inspired by the data layers of big companies (Twitter, Facebook, ...)</h4><p>The approach Prisma takes for this modernization is inspired by big tech companies such as Twitter, Facebook, or Airbnb. </p><p>To ensure productivity of application developers, it is a common practice in these organizations to introduce a <em>unified data access layer</em> that abstracts away the database infrastructure and provides developers with a more familiar and convenient way of accessing data.</p><p>Facebook developed a system called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/tao-facebooks-distributed-database-for-social-graph-c2b45f5346ea">TAO</a> that fulfills the data needs of application developers. Twitter has built a "virtual database" called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/graphql/graphql-at-twitter#schema">Strato</a> which <em>brings together multiple data sources so that they can be queried and mutated uniformly</em>. Airbnb <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/reconciling-graphql-and-thrift-at-airbnb-a97e8d290712">combines GraphQL and Thrift</a> to abstract away the implementation details of querying data.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/Hb9VOWN.png"></span></p><p>Building these custom data access layers requires <em>a lot</em> of time and resources (as these are typically implemented by dedicated <em>infrastructure teams</em>) and thus is not a realistic approach for most companies and development teams.</p><p>Being based on the same core ideas and principles as these systems, <strong>Prisma democratizes the pattern of a uniform data access layer</strong> and makes it accessible as an open-source technology for development teams of all sizes.</p><hr><h3 id="where-we-are-today"><a href="#where-we-are-today" aria-label="where we are today permalink"></a>Where we are today</h3><h4 id="prisma-20-is-ready-for-production"><a href="#prisma-20-is-ready-for-production" aria-label="prisma 20 is ready for production permalink"></a>Prisma 2.0 is ready for production</h4><p>After running Preview and Beta versions for more than a year, we've recently <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-n0v98rzc8br1">launched Prisma 2.0 for production</a>.

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Safe to say that the past couple months have gone a lot different than many of us were expecting. In early March, as quarantine was starting and all of my projection design gigs were being cancelled, I hit up a couple close friends about building a non-linear theatre experience entirely online. A lot of folks have been trying to perform plays on Zoom (and have found a lot of interesting and clever ways of working with that medium), but I felt like we could make something really unique if we built our own custom video conferencing app.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/initial-google-doc.png">
<strong>The Google Doc that started it all</strong></p>

<p>Crazy? It definitely would’ve been 10 years ago. But advances in the web platform (as well as the quality of cameras and hardware in mobile devices) took this down into the realm of “possible-if-slightly-quixotic”.</p>

<p>Three months later, we’ve done it: Shattered Space is a piece of interactive theatre about a binary star system whose twin stars (“The Mothers”) have disappeared. You and your fellow audience members are Star Jockeys, and have been conscripted to fly around in spaceships to get to know the denizens of the Matra System and see what you can do to help.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iifZPEHJM6c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Here’s a trailer if you want a better idea of what’s going on</strong></p>

<p>If you watched that trailer, you’ve probably figured out that this show involved 3D graphics (WebGL), videoconferencing (WebRTC) and perhaps also some music and audio processing (Web Audio). These were all technologies that I’d worked with on some level in the past, but this show required me to think about them completely differently. All because of the following central problem:</p>

<h2 id="other-peoples-computers">Other People’s Computers</h2>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGt8w9RbhvY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>This WebRTC-based monitoring system allowed the backstage band to see the stage in real time and take cues from actors. The onstage portal was rendered with WebGL. (<em>Welcome to Shakesville</em>, Baltimore Rock Opera Society 2019)</strong></p>

<p>I’ve used WebGL and WebRTC to build projection/video effects for a number of shows the past couple years, but in every case I was writing code that would only run on <strong>my</strong> computer. If I ran into a device-specific bug that affected my computer (or my iPhone, or my squad of Raspberry Pis) I had all the time and access I needed to either debug it or come up with a workaround. Not this time.</p>

<p>If someone pays us $15, receives the login link via email, tries to open it on a cheap 2014 laptop and it can’t load without crashing, that’s a refund. We weren’t just messing around with advanced web features, we needed to deploy them in the most battle-hardened and resilient way possible, while also capturing just enough data and logs to pinpoint who was having problems and ideally solve them before the show started.</p>

<p>This meant going beyond the kinds of code you see in introductory tutorials and really digging into how these APIs deal with memory management, how they respond to connection issues, how they can fail, and how to tweak things at runtime to ensure that framerates stay high and dropped packets are few. I learned a lot about productizing these features, and I’d like to share as much of that as I can, but first let’s talk basics.</p>

<h2 id="basic-platform-overview">Basic Platform Overview</h2>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/ship-in-flight.png">
<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>Attendees of Shattered Space are broken up into 6 groups of 5. Each group is assigned to a “ship” that flies around the system, and they interact with the characters in the show as a group. Attendees have the options to mute their microphone and turn off their camera if they wish (there is a text chat on the side they can use to communicate) although we encourage people to keep them on if they feel comfortable.</p>

<p>The Shattered Space platform consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ExpressJS service that keeps track of the overall state of the show.</li>
  <li>7 Janus WebRTC media servers. One for each ship and a extra for broadcasting a livestream of the ending scene.</li>
  <li>The Admin App, a React/Redux webapp that handles scheduling shows, keeping track of which actor is talking to which ship, and has real-time dashboards with logs of client-side errors and connectivity issues.</li>
  <li>The Actor App, a React/Redux webapp used by actors to interact with the audience via audio, video, text, and the giving/taking of items from a ship’s inventory.</li>
  <li>The Attendee App, a React/Redux webapp where attendees view the show and interact with the actors and each other via audio, video and text.</li>
  <li>The Host App, used by me to perform the motion-captured ending scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say that the Show Service “keeps track of the overall state of the show”, I mean <em>all</em> of the state. Most of the Redux actions (across all 3 apps) don’t mutate the state of the reducers, but instead hit an endpoint on the Show Service that changes the state kept in the database, then fetches <em>all</em> of the state from the database and sends it to <em>all</em> of the users as a WebSocket message which then overwrites most of the reducers’ state. This way, no client can end up with “orphan state” as a result of optimistically updating their reducer before their API call returns, and fetching the updated state for <em>all</em> users can be done with a single database call (this refresh-all-state-for-everyone method is debounced and implements a queueing mechanism to ensure we don’t have too many database calls at once).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/redux-oops.jpg">
<strong>I basically took Dan Abramov’s simple and elegant system and did this to it. <br> Sorry Dan.</strong></p>

<p>(I’d note that this architecture emerged sort of organicly and there are probably cleaner or more optimal ways of achieving this “Redux-but-the-server-is-the-reducer” architecture. I’m open to feedback on whether something like Relay or Meteor would be a better fit for a V2)</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/admin-show-online.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-screen.png">
<strong>The Admin app allows us to see who’s logged on and what’s happening in the show</strong></p>

<p>Of the 3 React/Redux apps, the Admin App uses the least of these shiny web technologies, and is pretty much just a dashboard for displaying what’s in the database. As admins, we can see which actors and attendees have logged on, which ships are currently visiting which actors, we can move attendees between ships if need be, and we can see a list of errors the actors and attendees have encountered (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-normal.png">
<strong>The actor app allows performers to engage with the audience and view information about the ship they’re talking to</strong></p>

<p>The Actor App is more sophisticated, since it needs to handle WebRTC and media device concerns. It also has 3 modes: Normal, Mobile (used automatically if the window has a dimension less than 500px) and Headless (used if the querystring variable <code>headless</code> is set to <code>true</code>. The Normal mode is used by about half of the actors, and has the ability for them to see themselves, configure their audio/video devices, change any info about their user, character or planet, and view information about the ships they’re talking to (their chat, inventory, history of previous places, etc.).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-mobile.jpg">
<img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-headless.png">
<strong>The mobile and headless modes of the actor app give our actors flexibility to use whatever devices they have available</strong></p>

<p>The Mobile mode uses a tab-based layout to try and accomplish all the same goals, but since only one tab can be on the screen at a time, it’s a bit of a pain to use on its own. We’ve got Headless mode, which doesn’t do any of the audio/video streaming, but shows all the information about the current ship and can run on any laptop. Many actors have opted for using the Mobile mode (since their phone has a good camera) but keeping Headless mode open on an old laptop to make it easier to use the other features.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/ship-in-flight.png">
<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>The Attendee app is about as complex as the actor app, but doesn’t have a Headless mode (which is really just a power-user feature for actors). This app has multiple screens corresponding to the different phases of the show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preshow - A lobby screen where attendees can meet the shipmates they’ll be flying with</li>
  <li>Intro - A tutorial video</li>
  <li>Freeplay - The bulk of the show, where attendees alternate between interacting with characters and choosing their next destination from the Navigation Screen</li>
  <li>Ending - A livestreamed 3D ending scene</li>
  <li>Ended - This just redirects attendees out of the app to <a href="https://shatteredspace.live/program.html" target="_blank">a static page with our casts’ bios</a>.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My setup for performing the motion capture at the end of the show</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the show, I perform a scene as Colonel Panic, the AI commander of the Star Jockeys. In this scene I go around to each ship and review the items they’ve managed to collect. Then a “resolution” happens that I won’t spoil here.</p>

<p>This performance is rendered on my desktop PC (Intel 8700K + RTX 2080TI) with a special version of the Actor app that I’ve built just for this purpose. The three.js scene here involves at least 7 huge models with MeshPhysicalMaterials and a dozen moving PointLights, so rather than rendering on attendees’ computers, I render it on mine and stream it to them using an <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k" target="_blank">Elgato Camlink 4K</a>, ffmpeg and the Janus (explained below) <a href="https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/streaming.html" target="_blank">Streaming plugin</a>.</p>

<p>The motion capture work is done by taking a modified version of Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/tracking_and_visualizing_faces" target="_blank">TrackingAndVisualizingFaces</a> example from the ARKit docs and having it send each frame of mocap data over WebSockets to the server, which then forwards them to the Host app. It’s amazing that this works with sub-100ms latency, but it does.</p>

<p>I’m planning on open-sourcing all of this when the show is done, but I’d want to purge the git history in case there are any secrets lying around, and I’d warn any interested spelunkers that it will be more of an …</p></div></div>

At its root we have a Cargo workspace with a <code>binaries</code> crate, and a number of supporting library crates.</p><p>Having our crates in one repo makes them easy to reference in our <code>binaries</code> crate without needing to publish to <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crates.io</a> or get too fancy with specifying git dependencies in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>. When the time comes to publish these libraries as open source, it's trivial to break it out into its own repo.</p><a href="#library,-binary,-why-not-both" id="library,-binary,-why-not-both"><h3>Library, binary, why not both?</h3></a><p>We have one main library crate that contains a unified API for talking to hardware, media codecs, network protocols, etc. Outside of that private API, we also have standalone crates in our workspace that we consider candidates for open-sourcing. For example, we’ve written our own actor framework fit for long-running high-throughput actors, as well as our own network protocol for reliable, high-bandwidth, low-latency media streaming.

We use separate binaries for different parts of the tonari system and each of these lives in <code>binaries</code>, a combination library/binary crate. Its library modules contains a set of reusable actors that combine our private API with our actor system, and then a collection of individual binaries that consume these actors and define the plumbing between them.</p><a href="#flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see" id="flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see"><h3>Flags as far as the eye can see</h3></a><p>We make extensive use of feature flags to allow development of our project on different OSes (like Brian's 1970s-era MacBook Pro) or different hardware configurations. This allows us to easily swap out camera hardware without extra runtime checks or using awful <code>sed</code> hacks.

For example, Linux uses <code>v4l2</code> (Video For Linux...2) to access most webcams, but other webcams might have their own SDK.  To compile for platforms that don't use <code>v4l2</code> or when an SDK isn't available for a particular OS, we can put those SDKs behind feature flags and export a common interface.

As a (simplified) concrete example, let's say we have a common camera interface defined as a trait:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> Capture <span>{</span>
    
    <span>fn</span> <span>capture</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>u8<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Let's also say we have three different camera interfaces - <code>v4l2</code>, <code>corevideo</code>, and <code>polaroid.</code> We can make our binaries work exclusively with this trait to be flexible, and we can swap in different implementations of <code>Capture</code> with feature flags.</p><pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>
<span>mod</span> v4l2 <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>impl</span> Capture <span>for</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = "polaroid")]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> VideoCapture <span>=</span> polaroid<span>::</span>PolaroidCapture<span>;</span></code></pre><p>If we make our code work with things which implement the <code>Capture</code> trait instead of concrete types, we can now compile on and target various platforms by simply toggling feature flags. For example, we can have a struct which has a field - <code>video_capture: Box&lt;dyn Capture&gt;</code> which will let us store any type which can <code>Capture</code> from a camera.

An example <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to support the capture implementations we wrote above might look something like …</p></div></div>

<h2>A multiplayer board game in Rust and WebAssembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">
<img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/screenshot.png">
</a></p><p>
<a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">Click to play!</a>
</p>
<p><em>Pont</em> is an online implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle">Qwirkle, a board game by Mindware Games</a>.
It was written for my parents,
so they could play with friends and family during the COVID-19 stay-at-home era.</p>
<p>Play is split into <strong>rooms</strong>,
which are identified by a three-word code
(<code>size moody shape</code> in the image above).
Within each room,
the game distributes pieces,
enforces the game rules,
and provides a local chat window.</p>
<p>Unusually, it's a web-based multiplayer game <strong>without any Javascript</strong>:
both the client and server are written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
which is compiled into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> to run on the browser.
(There's a Javascript shim to load the WebAssembly module, but I didn't have to write it myself)</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, I'm <em>not a web developer</em>,
so this is probably a weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider architecture</a>
for web applications.
Here's what the system looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/diagram.svg" alt="Diagram"></p>
<p>The system uses <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> for certificates:
both static assets and WebSocket communication are encrypted
between the client and the server.
The game server does not communicate securely with the NGINX proxy,
but if anyone is on the server watching,
I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm</code> bundle and <code>pont-server</code> executable are both
written in Rust and managed in the <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont"><code>pont</code> repository</a>.
They both depend on <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs"><code>pont-common</code></a>,
which defines basic types and logic for gameplay
(e.g. so that both the client and server can check whether a move is legal).</p>
<p>The client and server communicate via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>.
Messages are strongly typed as an <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs#L7-L48"><code>enum</code> in <code>pont-common</code></a>,
serialized using <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>,
and packed into <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">bincode</a>
to be sent as binary WebSocket messages.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The game server using async Rust,
which was... exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ej649l/a_summary_of_the_current_state_of_async_rust/fcw16a9/">"very polite cold war"</a>
going on between the two major (incompatible?) runtimes,
with packages that only work in one or the other</li>
<li>An <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/index.html">infinite</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">supply</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel/0.4.2/crossbeam_channel/">of</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/oneshot/fn.channel.html">options</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-channel-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures_channel/index.html">for</a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html">channels</a></li>
<li>General confusion between <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/"><code>futures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html"><code>std::Future</code></a>, and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.5/futures_util/"><code>futures_util</code></a>
(exacerbated by the fact that Googling for things will land you
into a random version of the docs)</li>
<li>Error messages that rival C++ in incomprehensibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, the Rust <code>async</code> ecosystem is relatively new,
so most of this can be ascribed to growing pains;
I'm sure that the ergonomics and library situation
will improve over time.</p>
<p>I ended up using the <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/smol"><code>smol</code> runtime</a>
because it's got relatively few dependencies,
and I appreciated that it wasn't trying to own the entire async universe
(unlike Tokio and <code>async-std</code>).</p>
<p>After getting over those hurdles,
the server architecture is relatively straightforward.
A bunch of independent tasks run asynchronously,
communicating to the outside world via WebSockets
and internally via <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/fn.unbounded.html">unbounded MPSC queues</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the server running one game (with two players),
plus one new client who has just connected.  Each rectangle
represents an async task:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/server.svg" alt="Server"></p>
<p>The system has <code>2 + n_players + n_games</code> async tasks running at one time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-level task which accepts incoming connections.</li>
<li>A top-level task which logs the number of active rooms, once per minute</li>
<li>One async task per client connection, which passes messages between the WebSocket connection
and the application's internal queues.</li>
<li>One async task per room, which handles game state</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks each map to a <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/0.1.10/smol/struct.Task.html"><code>smol::Task</code></a>.
(As a small optimization,
the first player's <code>Task</code> handles both the player communication
and running the room, which is why they're both blue in the diagram above)</p>
<p>The server compiles down to a 5 MB static binary.
The whole system is hosted on the smallest VM offered by
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>,
which is a $5/month machine.
I'm looking forward to the inevitable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">DDOS</a>,
where I can see how well it scales!</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs">2000 lines of framework-less excitement</a>.
It uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine pattern</a>
to represent the flow of the game,
accepting messages from the server
and updating the state accordingly:
for example, top-level state flows from
<code>Connecting</code> to <code>CreateOrJoin</code> to <code>Playing</code>.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as an SVG;
everything else is standard HTML elements.
In fact, the whole UI is pre-constructed in
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/deploy/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a>
and revealed on demand.</p>
<p>The client has a bit of polish:
Pieces are animated as they move around the board,
and there's an optional color-blind mode,
which adds corner markings to indicate color.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/cb.png" alt="Color-blind mode"></p>
<p>I use direct DOM manipulation
(from the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/"><code>web-sys</code></a> crate)
to control the system.
This exercise has left me appreciating the usefulness of virtual DOMs,
but I didn't want to bring in the complexity of a framework.
(Is there a Rust + <code>wasm</code> version of <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> yet?)</p>
<p>For deployment,
I'm using <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>
and serving the resulting <code>wasm</code> blob from the same server as the other static assets.</p>
<p>The main challenges on the client side were
(of course) dealing with cross-browser compatibility:
Safari, in particular, supports fewer features
and has funky handling of touch events.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>After a bit of a learning curve,
this all worked surprisingly well!</p>
<p>The client side is still a bit messy,
with animations, UI inputs,
and server events all fighting to break the system's invariants.
For example,
there was a nasty bug where dragging the board while
an animation was running could drop the system into an invalid state.</p>
<p>This isn't surprising:
stateful UIs are hard,
which explains the popularity of declarative approaches.
At this point, the client is feature-complete
and hasn't quite collapsed under its own weight,
so I'm not inclined to do any dramatic refactorings.</p>
<p>Rust as a language continues to be great,
despite minor complaints.
I already discussed the async ecosystem above,
and won't dwell on that any further.
On the client side,
there are often impedance mismatches with WebAssembly:
for example, using Rust closures as callbacks
requires
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs#L1189-L1211">cryptic boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, with all of the pieces in place,
making changes is pleasantly fast,
and I trust the compiler to check that I haven't broken anything.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the combination of WebSockets, Serde, and bincode:
having both the client and server process a strongly-typed stream of events
makes things easy to reason about.</p>

 <p>
  As I am currently right in the middle of a far-reaching rework of Genode's
  low-level GUI stack, I'd like to share a bit of background behind this work:
  the Why, the What, and the How.
 </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="Current_state"></a>
 Current state</h4>
  <p>
   The current incarnation of Genode's low-level GUI-related interfaces is almost
   identical to the very first version that we originally created in 2006.
   Genode has a very strong asymmetric notion of the
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/architecture/Recursive_system_structure.html#Client-server_relationship">relationship</a>
   between client and server components. In this relationship, the client depends
   on the server but the server does not depend on the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the lowest level, the framebuffer driver and input driver(s) were
   envisioned as servers that provide the <i>Framebuffer</i> and <i>Input</i> session
   interfaces to higher-level GUI components. From our former academic view, this
   felt natural because those drivers <i>provide</i> <i>resources</i> to other components.
   Provide... serve... server! The nitpicker GUI server uses those low-level
   services to implement a higher level service that ultimately allows for the
   multiplexing of graphics and input.
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/components/Common_session_interfaces.html#Nitpicker_GUI">Nitpicker</a>
   virtualizes the low-level framebuffer and input interfaces while supplementing
   the notions of visible views and input focus. Such a system looks as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_orig.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   The drivers and the nitpicker GUI server are displayed in red because they are
   servers. The GUI applications at the right are nitpicker clients. Nitpicker,
   in turn, is a client of the framebuffer and input drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The client interface of the nitpicker GUI server is success story. A few
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#GUI_stack">evolutionary tweaks</a>
   notwithstanding, the original design scales up to the windowed working
   environment of Sculpt OS while retaining the tiny complexity of the nitpicker
   GUI server.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the approach of modelling the framebuffer and input drivers as
   servers is a dead end, for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers are sometimes extremely complex. When looking at the complexity of
     the Intel framebuffer driver (ported from the Linux kernel) for example, it
     feels foolish to trust that it won't fail. Because the nitpicker GUI server
     depends on the liveliness of the driver, however, the well-being of the
     driver is on the critical path for the entire GUI stack and all GUI
     applications.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is impossible to transparently restart or replace the driver at runtime
     without also restarting the GUI stack and - transitively - all GUI
     applications. This is because the nitpicker GUI server is connected as a
     client to the drivers. The connections are like a life supply for the GUI
     server. Cutting those would ultimately kill the GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding secondary displays is rather difficult because this would require
     nitpicker to know what framebuffer servers are out there and to request
     multiple framebuffer connections. Adding such a protocol would inflate
     the complexity of nitpicker.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <h4>
 <a name="Inverting_interfaces"></a>
 Inverting interfaces</h4>
  <p>
   To overcome these limitations, we must break the dependency of the GUI
   server from the drivers, like illustrated here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_next.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   In this scenario, the GUI server no longer <i>uses</i> the drivers, but the drivers
   use the GUI server. The relationship is reversed. Only the nitpicker GUI
   server remains red. Of course, the drivers cannot talk to nitpicker GUI
   server via nitpicker's regular client interface. Instead, two new interfaces
   enter the picture:
  </p>
  <div><dl>
   <dt>The <i>Capture</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Framebuffer</i> session interface. It allows a client to obtain pixel data
     from the server. From the GUI server's perspective, a framebuffer driver
     is like a frame capturing device - which it is.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>The <i>Event</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Input</i> session interface. In contrast to a input session, which allows
     a client to obtain input events, an event session allows a client to
     induce input events. Nitpicker is an event server that consumes the input
     events from the driver(s).
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl></div>
  <p>
   The benefits of this approach are manifold:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The low-complexity GUI server remains as the only component that must never
     fail, which makes the GUI stack much more resilient compared to today.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Since the nitpicker GUI server no longer depends on the drivers, it can be
     started before the drivers are running, speeding up the boot time of
     graphical scenarios. In scenarios with rigid power management, we can remove
     the graphics driver - and switch off the graphics device - all while the GUI
     server and all GUI applications stay intact.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers can be restarted anytime. From the perspective of the nitpicker
     GUI server, this looks like a client disconnect and connect. Drivers
     can also be replaced at runtime, e.g., swapping out the VESA and Intel
     drivers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Connecting more than one driver to the nitpicker GUI server becomes
     conceptually simple. This clears the path towards multi-head support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The new capture session interface of the nitpicker GUI server would be
     the right hook for implementing screenshot/screencast applications, or a
     remote desktop server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Analogously to capture devices, input devices can enter and leave the
     system at any time without disruption, which will allow for the fine-grained
     management of USB HID devices. Think of plugging a new HID device to
     your Sculpt system. A new USB device would show up.
     The user can deploy the matching HID driver with the option of routing the
     event session of the driver to the system GUI server. Isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What is the downside? <i>It is a lot of work!</i> This leads us the following
   section.
  </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="The_plan"></a>
 The plan</h4>
  <p>
   Turning the low-level session interfaces upside down is an invasive operation
   that must be carried out in several steps, each yielding an intermediate
   consistent state.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     We start off with some low-risk <b>cosmetic</b> changes, namely the renaming
     of the "Nitpicker" session interface to "Gui" session. The strange
     branding of the session interface after a particular implementation is a
     relic from the early days. This
     <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3778">change</a> has already
     entered Genode's master branch.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consistently use <b>32-bit RGB</b> as pixel format by all drivers and
     applications. This is a long-standing feature request that eliminates
     the need for color-space conversions and generally improves the output
     quality.
     It is quite labor-intensive because it requires me testing many
     different hardware platforms covering the drivers vesa_fb_drv, fb_sdl,
     intel_fb_drv, imx53_fb_drv, imx8_fb_drv, rpi_fb_drv, boot_fb_drv,
     omap4_fb_drv, exynos5_fb_drv.
     This <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3784">change</a> has already
     progressed well.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Capture</b> session <b>interface</b>.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Implementing the <b>capture service</b> in the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introduce a <b>nitpicker</b> option to choose the framebuffer <b>back end</b> between
     the use of a requested framebuffer session (as done today), the use of a
     capture client for the pixel output, or the use of another GUI server
     (for stacking multiple instance of nitpicker).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Turn "Framebuffer" <b>drivers</b> into "Capture" clients, covering all the
     drivers mentioned above. Shoveling code. Adjusting all existing
     scenarios to use nitpicker's capture service.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Pruning</b> the remaining use of the <b>framebuffer client</b> interface.
     In fact, when done, I want to remove the <tt>Framebuffer::Connection</tt>
     completely. This will require the reworking of the terminal, MESA back end,
     several tests, and the liquid_framebuffer. In the process, I hope to largely
     eliminate the use cases of the nit_fb (now called gui_fb) component so
     that this component can be removed in the end.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Turning</b> a few other <b>framebuffer clients</b> into "Capture" servers, in
     particular test-framebuffer, fb_bench, and test-driver_manager.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Removal</b> of the "Framebuffer" <b>session interface</b>, retaining the interface
     merely as a part of the GUI session.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Event</b> session <b>interface</b> and adding its implementation
     to the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding a new <b>event_filter component</b> taking the place of the input_filter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     With the structural changes done, it would be time for optimizations.
     As a prerequisite for tear-free animations, the <b>frame buffering</b> will be
     moved from the clients into the nitpicker GUI server. At first, this will be
     transparent to most clients. The subsequent removal of client-side buffering
     is second independent step. As another optimization, I plan to go though all
     places that employed the dithering of pixels.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Of those topics, the rework of the framebuffer drivers is certainly the most
   elaborate one. I'm considering to drop the Exynos5 and OMAP4 drivers.
   Even though I strive for replacing the input session interface by the new
   event session interface, the scope of the task of reworking the input drivers
   is not yet completely tangible to me.

                                        <p>As someone who grew up throughout the 90's and 00's, some of my fondest memories stem from progressive advancements in internet and computing technologies.  Upgrading from Dial-Up internet to DSL was a grand event in our house.  I remember my brother and I fighting over the computer day in and day out to play games like Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory, which was released in 2003. (I'm convinced that this will be the all-time best FPS game ever created.)  At around the same time, we upgraded to one of the best Dell computer's available at the time. It had 512MB of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.  This was a major upgrade from our Compaq Celeron, which had something like 64MB of RAM. <br>

<p>Eventually, the grandeur of DSL faded as the rest of the world began to adopt Cable and Fiber internet.  It wasn't until I briefly moved to Philadelphia that I was finally able to experienced what I had been missing out on.  In college I lived in a neighborhood that was one of Verizon's first Fios builds.  I was absolutely blown away by the 25 Mbps connection.  This was in 2009. I'm amazed that over a decade later, in 2020, some households still don't have access to cable or fiber internet yet.</p>

<p>Like many of our customers do now, I could never figure out why it was so difficult to get us fiber service.  The cable is cheap, just throw it up on a pole and give me internet! Right?  Well, not so fast... <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/1849761.jpg" alt="Fiber Spaghetti"></p>

<p>A quick overview of how utility services are run and the challenges involved...</p>

<p>As most people know, there are primarily two ways to deliver utility services to a home or business.  Aerial and underground.  Water, gas, and sewer are always serviced underground for obvious reasons.  Electric, telephone, cable, and fiber have the ability to either be above or below ground.</p>

<h3 id="aerial">Aerial.</h3>

<p>As with anything else, aerial has pro's and con's.</p>

<p>The pro's are primarily upfront costs (this is debatable) and speed of deployment (this is also debatable).</p>

<p>The con's are that contrary to it being cheaper to physically deploy, the pole owners generally charge up-front make ready fee's.  These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $50,000/mile.  It's essentially pay to play.  If we want to attach to 50 poles, the pole owner might determine that 10 of those poles are old and need to be replaced before we can attach to them.  Rather than fork up the cash themselves, they'll force us to pay to replace their poles in order to approve the attachment.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are the annual pole fee's.  Depending on your agreement, we've seen pole fee's ranging anywhere from $7/pole per year all the way up to $43/pole per year with 10% annual increases (I'm looking at you PPL.  This ridiculous rate was purely intended to keep us from attaching to their poles, IMO.  It's impossible to make money with these rates). <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-22.04.34.png" alt="Pole Rates"></p>

<p>Another con is that even though installing the cable on poles is faster, it usually takes the pole owner around 6 months just to review applications and to determine make ready requirements and costs.  As an example, if we have fiber on a pole that's 1 pole short from being able to service your house, it would take at least 6 months just to run fiber to that one additional pole. So close, yet so far.</p>

<h3 id="underground">Underground.</h3>

<p>Like aerial, underground has its own list of pro's and con's.</p>

<p>When you install a service underground, you own it for life.  There are no annual fee's.  You pay one time to install it and you're set for life.  This sounds like a pro, but it's also a con.  When we run metro conduit, it generally costs us between $15-25/ft (not including customer drops).  For the sake of argument, let's assume we're at the high-end of our costs.  If we install 1,000ft of conduit, that's $25,000 that we need to pay out of pocket upfront.  Some blocks have upwards of 30 customers, but others have as little as 5.  Let's average it out at 20 customers per block, that's $1,250 upfront per customer, assuming we get every single customer.  Conservatively, we're initially looking at a 50% take rate.  This could grow to 100% overtime, but we never make that assumption. So that's $2,500/customer.  Imagine spending $2,500 per house/building and then have them tell you that your $69/m service is too expensive.  Generally speaking, we won't do a street unless our numbers look better than this, but this is a realistic scenario as we scale and get access to cheaper capital, etc.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Cost issues aside, there are a number of other hurdles one needs to get past just to begin the process of building out a network.  You'd think that risking everything you have in an effort to bring your local economy into the 21st Century would be a welcome sight.  That's what I thought too; was I wrong.  While there are plenty of supporters (I truly appreciate you all), there are just as many, if not more, critics.</p>

<p>We've been fortunate enough to have had a handful of people get behind us overtime and give us a shot.  I'm sure others haven't had it so easy.  I know this because even after we've become an established player in our city throughout the past 4 years, neighboring townships and municipalities haven't been as opened armed to welcome us into their communities as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail on small government policies that really hamper our ability to deploy underground later below.</p>

<h3 id="toomanyopinions">Too Many Opinions</h3>

<p>I'm generally a big fan of individual citizens trying to make an impact in their communities.  However, in too many cases these contributions seem to be made in the form of unproductive complaints rather than productive feedback or action.  Far too many people have a say in things that they probably shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case A.</em></strong></p>

<p>A new customer had recently signed an agreement with us to run fiber into their building.  This is a non-profit who's members are selflessly donating their time to restore a landmark in the community.  Upon receiving their signature, I notified the city that we would be pulling a permit to connect the building in question to our underground network.  They said okay; that was that.  Our nearest existing hand hole is approximately 90ft to the right of the new customer's property; in front of another property.  As a courtesy, I notified the manager of that establishment to let her know that we would be performing work over the weekend, from Friday into Saturday.  They're closed Saturday and Sunday so I had assumed they would appreciate the notice and possibly even sign up with us.  The project would involve removing 90ft of sidewalk, running conduit, and then restoring the sidewalk with brand spankin' new concrete.  The total timespan that this would occur, from when our shovel hit the ground to having new sidewalks in place, would be 48 hrs.  The response that I received from a member of their organization made me facepalm.</p>

<p><img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-18.53.55-copy.png" alt="Sidewalk Issues"></p>

<p>Not long after receiving this email, I became aware that they didn't even own the building in question, nevermind the sidewalk.  They lease it.  This was eventually "resolved" after a series of negotiations between the non-profit's president and the establishment in question.  Often times we aren't as lucky.</p>

<p>We initially planned to have this new customer installed within a week of them signing the contract.  Now it will end up being around 2 months from start to finish.  Long story short, I learned my lesson in trying to be courteous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case B.</em></strong></p>

<p>Last year we were installing conduit for our fiber optic network.  There were countless instances where people would literally stop their cars, roll down their windows, and yell profanities at us.  In what world is that acceptable behavior for an adult? I can't imagine being so far off my rocker that I would feel the need to yell at a bunch of construction workers trying to build a fiber optic network (not that they had any idea what we were doing).  If these are the types of people influencing decisions, there's something wrong.</p>

<p>City workers have a tough job fielding complaints from people like this and I commend them for it.  It shouldn't affect policy though.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case C.</em></strong></p>

<p>In another incident that took place not long, maybe a day or two, after <em>Case B</em> above.  A local store owner came back to us as we're swinging pick axes in 95 degree heat telling us we need to hurry up and we should hire more workers.  "My customers keep calling saying there's no where to park."  Mind you, we're standing right next to a massive parking lot that is approximately 1/3rd full.  I made my best attempt to kindly explain that paying 3 guys to stand around a hole to watch one person hand-dig to expose a utility isn't going to make our work go any faster.  I don't think he liked my response.</p>

<h3 id="theconsequences">The Consequences</h3>

<p>In many cases, resident complaints are justified.  Utility providers need to be held accountable for shitty restoration work.  However, the way in which bad restoration work is being combated is counter productive.  There has been a huge increase in curb-to-curb restoration requirements by local governments.  Essentially what these rules state is that anytime a utility cuts asphalt beyond a predetermined length, say 100ft, they are then responsible for replacing the entire road surface from the curb on the left side of the street to the curb on the right side of the street.  I believe some municipalities are also trying to introduce these measures to offload the costs of repaving roads themselves, similar to how pole owners force you to replace their aging utility poles under their make-ready requirements.  (One municipality told me as much when I attended a local council meeting in an effort to get them to waive this ridiculous ordinance for us.)</p>

<p>These policies will ultimately do more harm than good.  For us, these are the one and only thing preventing us from providing superior fiber internet services in these areas.  Forcing curb-to-curb asphalt …</p></div></div></div>

<hr>

<p><strong>It has been a long journey!</strong> I was silent for a while, haven’t posted regularly on my blog. But don’t worry, I’m fine. Instead, I took this situation around coronavirus and focused on writing a book “<em>Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU</em>”. I started writing this book almost a year ago, so I’m happy I finally can show something to the people. Right now, the <strong>early draft is ready and I’m welcoming everybody to review the book and maybe even add something to it</strong>. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, so I decided to make the book <strong>FREE</strong> for all. Eventually, everyone will be able to download PDF version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Why I started it?</strong> I started this book with one simple goal in mind: educate developers to better understand performance of their applications running on modern HW. Most of developers are used to look no further than the source code of their application without trying to understand performance implications of the changes they make. I know for many of us what happens under the hood is sort of black matter. I know it’s hard, but hopefully with this book, performance world of modern HW will become more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>What is the book about?</strong> Have you ever debated with a coworker about performance of a certain piece of code? Then you probably know how hard it is to predict which version is going to work best. With so many moving parts inside the modern processors even a small tweak to the code can trigger significant performance change. Besides all its complexity, HW has many features that support performance analysis. That’s right, CPUs are capable of telling us what performance bottlenecks are and where they occur. Thus, the book focuses on how your code looks like from the CPU perspective and provides recipes for HW specific optimizations. The core of the book is centered around how to find the right place in the code to improve performance.</p>

<p>Below I present the sweetest parts of the book contents:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1. Introduction
2. Measuring Performance
3. CPU Microarchitecture 101
4. Terminology And Metrics In Performance Analysis
5. Performance Analysis Approaches
  5.1. Code Instrumentation
  5.2. Tracing
  5.3. Workload Characterization
  5.4. Sampling
  5.5. Static Performance Analysis
  5.6. Compiler Optimization Reports
6. CPU Features For Performance Analysis
  6.1. Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMAM)
  6.2. Last Branch Record (LBR)
  6.3. Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS)
  6.4. Intel Processor Traces (PT)
7. Source Code Tuning For CPU
  7.1. Data-Driven Optimizations
  7.2. CPU Front-End Optimizations
  7.3. CPU Back-End Optimizations
  7.4. Optimizing Bad Speculation
  7.5. Other Tuning Areas
8. Optimizing Multithreaded Applications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Who is this book for?</strong> Primarily, this book is written for developers working in performance critical projects. This includes the following areas: High performance computing (HPC), High Frequency Trading (HFT), GameDev, Data Centers (Facebook, Google, etc), and other areas. But I hope it will be useful for any C++ developer: you can use this book to learn performance analysis which will stack up nicely with other skills you might have. All examples in the book are written in C/C++, but to the large extent they are applicable to any native programming language (like C, C++, Rust, Go and even Fortran). While this book is fairly low-level, I hope, it will be accessible even to developers that are just starting performance related work.</p>

<p>I gave this book all my knowledge and experience and I’m eager to share it with community. I decided to make this book open to everyone and <strong>I welcome everyone to review and contribute to the book</strong>. I hope, this way we can combine best performance practices and expertise from people in different areas.</p>

<p>I have a dedicated server with LXD installed where I have a bunch of system containers running to host a lot of my playground services, and to access the operating system of those lxc containers, I need to SSH to the LXD host, then exec or ssh into that LXC container.</p>

<p>This became tedious and wanted a way to directly ssh to them, as they don’t have public ip addresses, it’s not possible but found its possible to access them using proxyjump.</p>

</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>[you] -&gt; [hypervisor] -&gt; [vm on hypervisor]</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>First step is to create our ssh key:</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Add the created public key (<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>) on the hypervisor and the target vm’s <code>~/.ssh/authorized_key</code> files.</p>

<p>Then create the SSH Config on your local workstation (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>):</p>

    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>++--6064 lines: 00000000  04 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00  4c 4f 4...|+ +--6064 lines: 00000000  04 00 00 00 0a 00 00...

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<p>Over the last few parts, we haven't done much machine learning. Instead, we looked at how you can preprocess text data to get it ready for training machine learning models. In this part, you're going to put that knowledge to use in training a text classifier, a model, which, when given a piece of text, will understand the contents of that text.</p>
<p>You'll be working with the Sarcasm in News Headlines data set by Rishabh Misra, which is available on his website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. This is a really fun data set, which collects news headlines from normal news sources, as well as some more comedic ones from spoof news sites.</p>
<p>The data set is a JSON file with three columns. The <code>is_sarcastic</code> one is 1 if the record is sarcastic. Otherwise, it's 0. The <code>headline</code> is the headline of the article, and the <code>article_link</code> is a URL to the text of the article. We're just going to deal with the headlines here. So we have a super easy data set to work with. The headline is our feature, and the <code>is_sarcastic</code> is our label.</p>
<p>The data in JSON looks a bit like this.</p>
<pre>{
    "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/versace-black-code_us_5861fbefe4b0de3a08f600d5",
    "headline": "former versace store clerk sues over secret 'black code' for minority shoppers",
    "is_sarcastic": 0
}</pre>
<p>Each entry is a JSON field with the name-value pairs showing the column and associated data.</p>
<p>Here's the code to load it in Python when it's structured like that.</p>
<pre>import json

with open("sarcasm.json", 'r') as f:
    datastore = json.load(f)<br>
sentences = [] 
labels = []
urls = []
for item in datastore:
    sentences.append(item['headline'])
    labels.append(item['is_sarcastic'])
    urls.append(item['article_link'])</pre>
<p>I'll go through this piece by piece. First, we'll <code>import json</code> so that we can use the json parsers in Python. Then we'll open the <code>sarcasm.json</code> file.&nbsp; Using <code>json.load()</code>, we can load and parse the entire thing. I'll initialize arrays for the sentences, labels, and URLs. And I can now simply iterate through the datastore. And, for each item, I can append its headline, the sarcasm label, and URL to the appropriate array.</p>
<p>And that's it for loading the data. In previous parts, you may recall that we had hard-coded sentences into an array of strings. We now have exactly the same data structure for the headline sentences, despite that there are now over 25,000 of them. So, for the next code, despite us using this real data set, it will look very familiar. So let's dive in.</p>
<p>So here's the code to tokenize and sequence the sarcasm data set.</p>
<pre>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index<br>
print(len(word_index))
print(word_index)<br>
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')<br>
print(padded[0])
print(padded.shape)</pre>
<p>We create a tokenizer and fit it on the sentences. In this case, the sentences are the large array of 25,000-plus sentences that we read from the sarcasm data set. We can use the tokenizer to show us the <code>word_index</code> so we can see what words it learned from the data set.&nbsp;And here's an example of some of the words.</p>
<pre>... 'blowing': 4064, 'packed': 4065, 'deficit': 4066, 'essential': 4067, 'explaining': 4068, 'pollution': 4069, 'braces': 4070, 'protester': 4071, 'uncle': 4072 ...</pre>
<p>Remember from earlier that the words with the lower number tokens are the ones that are more common, and the ones with the higher numbers, was less commonly used in the data set. So, of all of the words here, hurting is the one that was found most often.</p>
<p>We can now turn all of our sentences into sequences where, instead of words, we have the tokens representing those words. We'll pad them post, which means that all of the sentences will be the length of whatever the longest one is. And anything shorter than that will be padded with zeros at the end of the sentences in order to keep them all the same length. If we want to inspect them, we can then print out one of them, and we can print out the shape of the entire padded data structure. You'll see output like this.</p>
<pre>[  308 15115   679  3337  2298    48   382  2576 15116     6  2577  8434
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0]<p>(26709, 40)</p></pre>
<p>This is the first sentence in our corpus after tokenizing and padding. It's a shorter sentence. So it ends with a bunch of zeros. And this is the shape of the data structure for the padding. This tells us that we have 26,709 padded sentences, and each of these is 40 values long.</p>
<p>With just a few lines of code, you've loaded the data from sarcasm into sentence arrays, tokenized, and padded them.</p>
<p>First, in the code, you'll see a number of commonly used variables. Each of these will be used throughout the code. You've seen many of them so far, but others, like the embedding dimension, will be clear later. The <code>training_size</code> of 20,000 will be used next.</p>
<pre>vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 16
max_length = 100
trunc_type='post'
padding_type='post'
oov_tok = ""
training_size = 20000</pre>
<p>We have a corpus of many thousands of sentences and labels. And, moments ago, we specified 20,000 as the <code>training_size</code>. So that many sentences and labels will be the training set. And we'll hold back the other 6,000 or so as a validation set.</p>
<p>So our <code>training_sentences</code> will be the complete corpus from 0 to the <code>training_size</code>. And our <code>testing_sentences</code> will be from the <code>training_size</code> to the end of the set. We can do similar with the labels. The training will be the first batch, and the testing will be the last ones.</p>
<pre>training_sentences = sentences[0:training_size]
testing_sentences = sentences[training_size:]
training_labels = labels[0:training_size]
testing_labels = labels[training_size:]</pre>
<p>As we've split the data into training and testing sets, we should do the same for the padded sets, instead of having that one large master one that we had earlier on.</p>
<pre>tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token=oov_tok)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_sentences)

word_index = tokenizer.word_index

training_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_sentences)
training_padded = pad_sequences(training_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)

testing_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(testing_sentences)
testing_padded = pad_sequences(testing_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)</pre>
<p>First, we'll create a tokenizer, and we'll specify the number of words that we want and what the out-of-vocabulary token should be. We'll fit the tokenizer to just the training_sentence corpus. This will help us accurately reflect any real-world usage. Our testing_sentences can be tested against the vocab that was learned from the training set. Now we can create a set of <code>training_sequences</code> from just the <code>training_sentences</code>. And we can pad these to get a set of padded training sentences. And then we can just do the same thing for the <code>testing_sentences</code> and for all the labels.</p>
<p>So before we can train a model with this, let's take a look at the concept of embeddings, which help us turn the sentiment of a word into a number in much the same way as we tokenized words earlier. In this case, an embedding is a vector pointing in a direction, and we can use those directions to establish meanings in words. I know this is all very vague. So let me explain it visually.</p>
<p>For example, consider the words <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>good</strong>. Now we know they have opposite meanings. So we could draw them as arrows pointing in opposite directions.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="826" height="91"> We could then describe the word <strong>meh</strong> as being sort of bad, but not really that bad. So it might be an arrow like this. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="797" height="349">And then the phrase not bad, it's not as strong as good, but it's more or less in the same direction as good. So we could draw it with an arrow like this.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="800" height="343"> If we then plot these on a chart, we could then get coordinates for these arrows. These coordinates could then be seen as embeddings for the sentiment of those words. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="969" height="491">There's no absolute meaning, but, relative to each other, we can establish sentiment.</p>
<p>To do this in code, we can simply use a Keras layer called an Embedding.</p>
<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])</pre>
<p>Our Embedding should be defined as a vector for every word. So we're going to take vocab-sized words and then specify how many dimensions we want the arrow direction to use.&nbsp; In this case, it's 16 that we created earlier. So the Embedding layer will learn 10,016 dimension vectors where the direction of the vector establishes the sentiment of the word. By matching the words to the labels, it'll have a direction that it can then start learning from.</p>
<p>Once we've defined the model, we can then train it like this.</p>
<pre>num_epochs = 30
history = model.fit(training_padded, training_labels, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(testing_padded, testing_labels), verbose=2)</pre>
<p>We simply specify the training_padded features and labels, as well as the validation ones.</p>
<p>Now you can try it for yourself. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2F3d6sIJY&amp;redir_token=ONe-_plC_prURgXQYxiQIX-HJVJ8MTU5MzE4OTQ0OEAxNTkzMTAzMDQ4&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=-8XmD2zsFBI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">URL</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully that was an interesting exploration for you into the beginnings of NLP with TensorFlow. And that brings us to the end of this 10-part series on foundations of machine learning. I hope you've enjoyed these series, and I hope you've been able to learn from them.</p>

<p>And of course, the Oregon Trail, a game that will forever define a generation:</p>

<p>But there was one fad I remember that not only took our school by storm, but schools all across the country as well. It grew so feverish that after a few months, schools had to actually ban this activity because too many students were getting obsessed with it.</p>
<p>If you were an ‘80s or ‘90s kid, chances are you’ll remember it too.</p>
<p>I’m referring to the infamous world of pogs:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>For those that didn’t get to experience this craze, I’ll briefly break it down for you.</p>
<p>Pogs were these thin, circular discs that were largely made from one of three materials: paper, aluminum, or plastic.<span title="Some kids had crazy titanium ones, but for those of us that weren’t born into extreme wealth, it wasn’t an option.">1</span> Each pog had a “face” side that had some sort of cool, colorful design on it, and a “back” side that was left blank.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The game itself was super simple, which made it ideal for 2nd graders across the world.</p>
<p>Each round, the players would contribute a few paper pogs, put them face down, and stack them up into one long cylinder. This is the “ante,” or the prize that the players are looking to win.</p>
<p>Then using a special, denser pog that was either made from aluminum or plastic (known as a “slammer” and “pounder,” respectively), each player would try to slam it on the stack, and flip over as many paper pogs as possible. Whichever pogs are successfully turned over would be the prizes they win.</p>

<p>That’s the whole game in a nutshell. Essentially, it’s slapping dense discs onto a stack of lesser dense discs, hoping to turn over as much of them as possible before the recess bell rings. Seems pretty harmless, right?</p>
<p>Well… there was one component to the game that made it a bit problematic for child psychology.</p>
<p>Before any game starts, you have to declare whether you’re playing “for fun” or “for keeps.” “For fun” means that you’re not actually keeping the pogs you turn over, and are returning them back to their original owners at the end of each match. “For keeps,” of course, means that you now own the pogs you turn over successfully, meaning that someone must lose something if another person wins.</p>
<p>Basically, a nice little gambling ring was growing amongst us starry-eyed 2nd graders.</p>

<p>Pogs originally started off as a little recess activity, but began morphing into something far greater.</p>
<p>Kids began comparing each other to how many pogs they had, and started forming groups based on the types of pogs that were owned and won. The kids with gold-plated, shiny pounders kept winning, so they needed to up the stakes and play for higher prizes. The kids that only had paper discs would be off in the sandbox being peasants.</p>
<p>Pogs became the shared currency of the school. Kids were trading their fruit rollups for slammers, their Lunchables for pounders. Kids were literally getting into fist fights over them. And of course, if you didn’t play pogs at all, you might as well be an invisible node of society. All that mattered was how many of them you had, and if you had the right equipment to win even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12190140/A08-Pogs-at-School-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Eventually, the school staff saw enough crazed, disc-slamming kids in the hallways and put an end to the whole thing. They justified the ban by saying it was a form of gambling, but they probably just wanted to see things come back to normal for a bit.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, was that those adults were playing a very similar game in their own lives as well.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how money is accepted as an inevitable force in our lives, yet when we take out the concept and wrap it in unfamiliar packaging, it seems weird and dumb.</p>
<p>To the school staff, the whole pogs phenomenon probably seemed silly because they couldn’t understand what could be so compelling about flipping over paper and metal discs. But they wouldn’t think twice at the thought of coming into an office everyday, flipping over documents, and depositing a bi-weekly paper check in a metal machine.</p>
<p>In essence, the kids were doing the same thing the adults were doing: they were accumulating value in the form of a communal good. But because it took the form of something unrecognizable, it was considered dumb rather than profound. In the eyes of the adults, pogs were shittily constructed paper discs that had no intrinsic value, and only held importance because the kids themselves thought they were.</p>
<p>Well, those kids could say the same thing about the way we regard our own currency as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The most fascinating thing about the pogs phenomenon is how closely it mirrors the story of money, and how that concept naturally manifested in children.</p>
<p>On one side you have paper, aluminum, and plastic discs that have no inherent value – they can’t be eaten, worn, or slept on. On their own, they’re useless.</p>
<p>On the other side you have paper bills, metal coins, and digits on a screen that can’t be used as ends in themselves either. They’re just as useless.</p>
<p>Yet in both scenarios, a united story emerged that turned an intrinsically useless thing into the distributor of status, value, and prestige.</p>
<p>How in the world does this happen?</p>
<p>How does something with no intrinsic value become the universal determinant of value? And what are the implications this has on human behavior as a whole?</p>
<p>Discussions of money usually come with the implicit understanding that money is valuable, so they revolve around how one could accumulate more of it, or why it introduces <a href="https://moretothat.com/money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all kinds of strange behaviors</a>. But in this post, we’re going to take one step back and actually look at the concept of money itself: why we need it to represent value, how it impacts our goals, and how it reconstructs our idea of individuality.</p>
<p>This is a dive into the philosophy of money. It’s a look into humanity’s greatest idea, its greatest paradox, and the story that forever changed human behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>Money and The Great Abstraction</h3>
<p>Everything starts with the fact that money has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain why this is, but in order to do so, I need to first introduce my favorite game show ever:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The Price Is Right is a brilliant TV show where hyped-up contestants play a series of pricing estimation games. Essentially, whoever can guess the price of random shit better than the next person will find their way to a final showcase, where they can win a combination of a potted plant, a trip to Detroit, and a brand… new…. CAR!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>One of my favorite mini-games on the show was the Bonus Game, where the contestant must guess whether or not the real price of an item is higher or lower than what is displayed to the public.</p>
<p>And the best part?</p>
<p>The audience also gets to chime in and scream their opinions at the contestant, who then has to sort through a blend of aggressive commands to get to her final answer.</p>
<p>Here’s an amazing clip of the game in action:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/429124077" width="650" height="406" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>First off, Bob Barker had jokes for days.</p>
<p>But second, and more important:</p>
<p>This game is a perfect example of the discrepancy between subjective value and objective reality.</p>
<p>When people in the audience are <em>screaming</em> their opinions of what the price of an alarm clock is, what they are doing is making a <span><strong>value assessment</strong></span> about the object in question. Each person’s idea of that clock’s value is anchored to a personal experience one has with that item, and that could be based on a host of factors.</p>
<p><em>Am I using that alarm clock now? If not, how much is the one I’m currently using? Does that featured clock look like it’d be of better quality? Wait… why do I even care about this damn clock in the first place?</em></p>
<p>From the contestant’s point of view, the audience members sound like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>But to each audience member, every shout is guided by a judgment that is formed by personal experience, desire, and need:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Throughout all this, however, the clock simply exists. It is a collection of atoms and molecules that have been assembled to take this form, and there’s no value that is inherent in its chemical makeup. The only function it has is the one we assign it. We would primarily use it to wake up in the morning, but if there was a scary cockroach nearby that we wanted to get rid of, we could use the clock as an anvil too.</p>
<p>This creates a scenario where reality simply is, but the value we assign it will vary based upon the individual that interacts with it. And as illustrated in The Price Is Right, that value is spread across <span><strong>a spectrum of infinite wants and experiences</strong></span>, where one person would be willing to give up more than her neighbor, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For any one item of reality, there will be all kinds of value assessments attached to it, none of which are expected to be the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>So we need to form an intermediary between reality and value that could bridge the gap between the two. A way to standardize infinite value assessments into something understandable and transferable.</p>
<p>That third-party, of course, is money.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Money’s greatest achievement is its ability to standardize value across otherwise incomparable realities. For example, there’s no way I could tell you how many clocks I’d give for your car, or how many clocks I’d give for your house. But communicate those objects of desire through the language of money, and I’ll be able to calculate some relationship between the two.</p>
<p>This ability to create value relationships between every object or service is what allowed money to build a web through every corner of life. Before money, goods stood on their own because they were simply bartered for another object of desire. But after money, the value of goods were always calculated based on a third-party: some currency that was agreed upon by all the members of that society.</p>
<p>The question here then becomes: <em>how was that currency determined?</em></p>
<p>In money’s early history, it needed to have some sort of value inherent in it for people to trust it as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Its first iteration appeared in Sumer around 3,000 BC, where it manifested in the …</p></div></div>

				<p>Laura Deming is a biologist and founder of The Longevity Fund, the first VC firm to focus on companies that work on extending healthy human lifespan and addressing age-related diseases through biotechnology. She grew her roots in biology as a homeschooling student in New Zealand, and moved to the US to work in a <a href="https://hillblomcenter.ucsf.edu/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Hillblom,diseases%20have%20similar%20molecular%20causes.">UCSF biology lab</a> at age 12. By age 14, she was a student at MIT, then became a <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/">Thiel Fellow</a>.

My most persistent focus is something that I can’t talk about yet because it would sound slightly insane, but right now, I’m pursuing these more coherent questions: &nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Is there a flywheel effect with biological tools? Will biological discoveries become the tools for next-generation discovery? How might we predict progress in biology?</li><li>Why does it normally take about a year for the best proto-entrepreneurs I know to reach full conviction about starting a company? What are ways to accelerate that process?</li><li>Is there an immortal cell that doesn’t replicate anywhere on earth? (We presumably wouldn’t see it if there was.)</li></ol><p>I’m really obsessed with <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/">Cell Biology by the Numbers</a>. I think quantitative intuitive models of biology are the best thing ever. Also <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-morality-fundamental-physics">this Nima Arkani-Hamed</a> video is literally the best thing ever.</p><h3 id="what-was-your-education-like">What was your education like?</h3><p>I grew up homeschooled in NZ with a hilariously small amount of context for what the real world was like. In retrospect, it was totally ideal. I had two strong memes deeply implanted in my cranium early in life - <em>I love science </em>and <em>it’s my job to do something really important </em>and<em> I can do it, too. </em>I have no clue who I’d be without those memes, and I’m also not sure that the latter was actually true! My dad just always told me that I was exceptional and could work out a way whatever I wanted to do in the world and I believed him. I still do, in a funny way, despite about a decade of evidence to the contrary and realizing how actually hard it is to make drugs for complex diseases. It’s extraordinarily sad how many otherwise brilliant kids might not do things they could because they don’t have a similarly supportive environment — I’m really excited for things like <a href="https://dcgross.com/">Daniel Gross</a>’s <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> for that reason. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/image.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/image.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/image.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w2000/2020/06/image.png 2000w"><figcaption>Laura as a child, drawing DNA on the pavement outside of her house in chalk, an anecdote from a talk that she gave for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwslKJut8eM">TedxYouth@Tallinn</a>.

And then starting to think more independently in college, and to try to figure out what problems I wanted to work on. But I had this moment around that time where a friend and I were driving to a camping site, and I was trying to explain a math concept to him, and he abruptly turned to me and said “I’m feeling very frustrated right now because you honestly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”<em> </em></p><p>It’s really hard to explain without context how actually useful that comment was. As he explained it, I was just parroting off the definition of something. The real way to understand things is to be able to see, explore, feel the concept from a bunch of different angles, and to be able to rigorously prove things about it. I still struggle with the latter, but having an intuition for what <em>real, deep </em>understanding of a concept looks like has been a great guidepost. For example, I realized I didn’t understand what entropy was, and now kind of do, after a summer of being in near tears with frustration about it. </p><h3 id="where-and-when-did-your-mission-to-improve-longevity-originate">Where and when did your mission to improve longevity originate?</h3><p>It’s funny, because I get asked that question a lot. I think of it like this: if you were to watch a million people jump off a bridge every day and just suffer in a really extreme way throughout all of it, How would we respond as a society? An overwhelming number of people would be inspired to take action and help. When you think of it in acute, immediate terms, viscerally shocking and moving. But with longevity and other deeply existential problems, the horror of what’s happening has been tragically normalized.</p><p>I really just wanted to work on the biggest problem possible. At first I thought that was cancer, but after a variety of experiences, aging just seemed like a bigger deal.</p><p>I have a much less antagonistic relationship with death now than I did when I was a kid. I understand more that we are a species, that there’s something beyond us as individuals — but despite that, I absolutely cannot square the idea of sobbing when a relative gets cancer and then being totally fine with another debilitating degenerative disease also caused by aging that we somehow have collectively decided is natural and normal.</p><h3 id="how-has-the-way-you-learned-as-a-kid-shaped-the-way-you-learn-and-make-decisions-at-the-helm-of-the-longevity-fund">How has the way you learned as a kid shaped the way you learn and make decisions at the helm of The Longevity Fund?</h3><p>I’ve had to un-learn a bunch of stuff I learned when I first came to the professional world. As a kid, I was deeply joyous about science. I loved it directly and with a passion, and I absolutely believed I was going to grow up to be like Michael Faraday (his story about <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/people-of-science-michael-faraday-the-royal-society/HQLyLIo6MWpoKw?hl=en">getting an apprenticeship with Humphrey Davy</a> is amazing, by the way). When I entered the world of finance with my fund, I was totally scared to seem like I didn’t know what I was doing, and I felt like it was really important to hide who I was to seem more ‘adult’. Now, in retrospect, I think that was both understandable and a bit of a mistake.</p><p>One thing I learned as a kid that I keep on forgetting so easily is how not to care about what anyone else thinks (with a few close exceptions). It’s funny - even in Silicon Valley, hypothetically the vanguard of independent thought, I feel like that’s extremely hard to do. In part, because what other people think constrains your access to resources. So it’s an interesting balance. </p><h3 id="i-ve-heard-you-talk-about-your-dad-telling-you-at-12-years-old-to-make-sure-that-everyone-was-a-little-bit-happier-because-you-were-in-the-lab-each-day-what-role-did-your-parents-play-in-your-life-and-education">I’ve heard you talk about your dad telling you at 12 years old to make sure that everyone was a little bit happier because you were in the lab each day. What role did your parents play in your life and education?</h3><p>Oh, man. My Dad had so much good advice as a kid — I really felt like I got a cheat code to life early on. It was like being Ben Franklin’s daughter or something. I’m probably exaggerating, but it felt that way. </p><p>One thing he told me was ‘action comes before motivation’ - that’s always been an incredibly powerful thing in my life. He taught me a lot about putting your head down and working hard and not believing anyone who tells you you are great, having that come mostly from your own self-judgment. Being extremely humble around people who know more, finding any way on earth to help them. </p><p>My dad also taught me a lot about humor and how ridiculous the world was in so many different ways. Almost too much - I think I take things more seriously now. But it’s kind of the Mark Twain effect - the world and everyone in it is a hilarious, self-sabotaging, foolhardy place that is also one of the most deeply joyous and interesting things going on in the galaxy. He used to say you can either look at what’s going on in the world and cry or laugh. Why not pick the latter?</p><p>My mom taught me about kindness and empathy and wanting to help others. She’s probably the most giving person I know. </p><p>When I first met Cynthia Kenyon, who literally changed my and many other lives – she’s amazing – I had this very extreme mental conceit that I would beg her to scrub floors in her lab and somehow work my way up on the academic ladder. I was 12. She very kindly offered for me to just work in her lab as a normal intern, which was so kind in retrospect. It changed my life, to be taken seriously like that at a young age. </p><h3 id="i-love-how-you-describe-the-way-the-longevity-fund-removes-limits-on-who-can-participate-in-biomedical-entrepreneurship-how-can-we-translate-some-of-what-you-ve-learned-about-diverse-participation-in-science-to-the-way-that-kids-learn">I love how you describe the way The Longevity Fund removes limits on who can participate in biomedical entrepreneurship. How can we translate some of what you’ve learned about diverse participation in science to the way that kids learn?</h3><p>I think there’s something about being absolutely delighted when you meet someone who doesn’t know something. That feeling is the best thing in the world because <em>you get to be the first person to tell them about some incredibly cool natural phenomenon</em>. That’s pretty great. I still remember being a preteen in Cynthia’s lab when Marc McCormick described how SVMs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a>) worked for handwriting recognition in the postal system. He was just so good at explaining things, and that really stuck. Encourage people to own ideas, be skeptical of them, and learn to delight in poking holes in things.<br></p><p>When thinking about diverse participation, it’s funny – before I came to the Valley, I had absolutely no idea that being a girl was in any way a handicap. To me, it was an obvious advantage – in a sea of people who all looked the same way, I’d stick out like a sore thumb! If I could make it, wouldn’t I obviously be an amazing role model? Being in the valley for a while, it kind of wore off, and the more articles I read about how much it sucked to be a girl in science, the more I believed it. I’m not sure what to think about all of that, really. </p><h3 id="what-s-something-you-believe-that-most-people-don-t">What’s something you believe that most people don’t?</h3><p>I can give you a few!</p><ol><li>That we will see the first drug to measurably affect <a href="https://publichealth.wustl.edu/heatlhspan-is-more-important-than-lifespan-so-why-dont-more-people-know-about-it/">human healthspan</a> tested in the next decade, and that this is one of the biggest deals in how we thinking about disease.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Note: This is an old post originally from the documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> programming language, that I've touched up and fleshed out. After the time that it was written I've found out about <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a>, a Rust library with very similar goals to my Rock library, which is definitely worth checking out as well!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Compilers are no longer just black boxes that take a bunch of source files and produce assembly code. We expect them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be incremental, meaning that if we recompile a project after having made a few changes we only recompile what is affected by the changes.</li>
<li>Provide editor tooling, e.g. through a <a href="https://langserver.org/">language server</a>, supporting functionality like going to definition, finding the type of the expression at a specific location, and showing error messages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Anders Hejlsberg talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdV1M7n4gQ">his video on modern compiler construction</a> that some of you might have seen.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover how this is achieved in <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> by building the compiler around a query system.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know, Sixten is an experimental functional programming language created to give the programmer more control over memory layout and boxing than most other high-level languages do. The most recent development of Sixten is being done in the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixty">Sixty</a> repository, and is completely query-based. Here's a little video giving a taste of what its language server can do, showing type-based completions:</p>

<h2 id="traditional-pipeline-based-compiler-architectures">Traditional pipeline-based compiler architectures</h2>
<p>A traditional compiler pipeline might look a bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>+-----------+            +-----+                +--------+               +--------+</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>|           |            |     |                |        |               |        |</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>|source text|---parse---&gt;| AST |---typecheck-+-&gt;|core AST|---generate---&gt;|assembly|</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>|           |            |     |       ^        |        |               |        |</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>+-----------+            +-----+       |        +--------+               +---------</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a>                                 read and write</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a>                                     types</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a>                                       v</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>                                  +----------+</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a>                                  |type table|</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>                                  +----------+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many variations, and often more steps and intermediate representations than in the illustration, but the idea stays the same:</p>
<p>We push source text down a pipeline and run a fixed set of transformations until we finally output assembly code or some other target language. Along the way we often need to read and update some state. For example, we might update a type table during type checking so we can later look up the type of entities that the code refers to.</p>
<p>Traditional compiler pipelines are probably quite familiar to many of us, but how query-based compilers should be architected might not be as well-known. Here I will describe one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="going-from-pipeline-to-queries">Going from pipeline to queries</h2>
<p>What does it take to get the type of a qualified name, such as <code>"Data.List.map"</code>? In a pipeline-based architecture we would just look it up in the type table. With queries, we have to think differently. Instead of relying on having updated some piece of state, we do it as if it was done from scratch.</p>
<p>As a first iteration, we do it <em>completely</em> from scratch. It might look a little bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> parseModule sourceCode</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We first find out what file the name comes from, which might be <code>Data/List.vix</code> for <code>Data.List</code>, then read the contents of the file, parse it, perhaps we do name resolution to find out what the names in the code refer to given what is imported, and last we look up the name-resolved definition and type check it, returning its type.</p>
<p>All this for just for getting the type of an identifier? It seems ridiculous because looking up the type of a name is something we'll do loads of times during the type checking of a module. Luckily we're not done yet.</p>
<p>Let's first refactor the code into smaller functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>fetchParsedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>fetchParsedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>  parseModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>fetchResolvedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>fetchResolvedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a>  resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-15"><a href="#cb3-15"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-16"><a href="#cb3-16"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that each of the functions do everything from scratch on their own, i.e. they're each doing a (longer and longer) prefix of the work you'd do in a pipeline. I've found this to be a common pattern in my query-based compilers.</p>
<p>One way to make this efficient would be to add a memoisation layer around each function. That way, we do some expensive work the first time we invoke a function with a specific argument, but subsequent calls are cheap as they can return the cached result.</p>
<p>This is essentially what we'll do, but we won't use a separate cache per function, but instead have a central cache, indexed by the query. This functionality is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a>, a library that packages up some functionality for creating query-based compilers.</p>
<h2 id="the-rock-library">The Rock library</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a> is an experimental library heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake">Shake</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build systems à la carte paper</a>. It essentially implements a build system framework, like <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>Build systems have a lot in common with modern compilers since we want them to be incremental, i.e. to take advantage of previous build results when building anew with few changes. But there's also a difference: Most build systems don't care about the <em>types</em> of their queries since they work at the level of files and file systems.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is closer to what we want. There the user writes a bunch of computations, <em>tasks</em>, choosing a suitable type for keys and a type for values. The tasks are formulated assuming they're run in an environment where there is a function <code>fetch</code> of type <code>Key -&gt; Task Value</code>, where <code>Task</code> is a type for describing build system rules, that can be used to fetch the value of a dependency with a specific key. In our above example, the key type might look like this:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>TypeKey</span> <span>QualifiedName</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The build system has control over what code runs when we do a <code>fetch</code>, so by varying that it can do fine-grained dependency tracking, memoisation, and incremental updates.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is also about exploring what kind of build systems we get when we vary what <code>Task</code> is allowed to do, e.g. if it's a <code>Monad</code> or <code>Applicative</code>. In Rock, we're not exploring <em>that</em>, so our <code>Task</code> is a thin layer on top of <code>IO</code>.</p>
<p>A problem that pops up now, however, is that there's no satisfactory type for <code>Value</code>. We want <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code> to return a <code>ParsedModule</code>, while <code>fetch (TypeKey "Data.List.map")</code> should return something of type <code>Type</code>.</p>
<h3 id="indexed-queries">Indexed queries</h3>
<p>Rock allows us to index the key type by the return type of the query. The <code>Key</code> type in our running example becomes the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>Type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>fetch</code> function gets the type <code>forall a. Key a -&gt; Task a</code>, so we get a <code>ParsedModule</code> when we run <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code>, like we wanted, because the return type depends on the key we use.</p>
<p>Now that we know what <code>fetch</code> should look like, it's also worth revealing what the <code>Task</code> type looks like in Rock, more concretely. As mentioned, it's a thin layer around <code>IO</code>, providing a way to <code>fetch</code> <code>key</code>s (like <code>Key</code> above):</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> key a <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> {<span> unTask ::</span> <span>ReaderT</span> (<span>Fetch</span> key) <span>IO</span> a }</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Fetch</span> key <span>=</span> <span>Fetch</span> (<span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> key a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rules of our compiler, i.e. its "Makefile", then becomes the following function, reusing the functions from above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>rules ::</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>rules key <span>=</span> <span>case</span> key <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>    fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span> qualifiedName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>    fetchType qualifiedName</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>The most basic way to run a <code>Task</code> in Rock is to directly call the <code>rules</code> function when a <code>Task</code> fetches a key. This results in an inefficient build system that recomputes every query from scratch.</p>
<p>But the <code>Rock</code> library lets us layer more functionality onto our <code>rules</code> function, and one thing that we can add is memoisation. If we do that Rock caches the result of each fetched key by storing the key-value pairs of already performed fetches in a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-hashmap">dependent hashmap</a>. This way, we perform each query at most once during a single run of the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-dependencies-and-reusing-state">Verifying dependencies and reusing state</h3>
<p>Another kind of functionality that can be layered onto the <code>rules</code> function is incremental updates. When it's used, Rock keeps track of what dependencies a task used when it was executed (much like Shake) in a table, i.e. what keys it fetched and what the values were. Using this information it's able to determine when it's safe to reuse the cache <em>from a previous run of the compiler</em> even though there might be changes in other parts of the dependency graph.</p>
<p>This fine-grained dependency tracking also allows reusing the cache when a dependency of a task changes in a way that has no effect. For example, whitespace changes might trigger a re-parse, but since the AST is the same, the cache can be reused in queries that depend on the …</p></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>The first time I used <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/">ASGI</a>(<em>Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface</em>) was through <a href="https://github.com/django/channels">Channels</a> 1.0 when ASGI spec was still a draft. It was my first interview project which helped me get my current job at <a href="https://fellow.app/">Fellow</a>. It felt magical at that time how easy it is to add WebSocket functionality to my Django app and handles authentication and other Django related things for me seamlessly.</p>

<p>ASGI specification is now at version 3 at the time of writing and both ASGI and Channels became part of Django Software Foundation. Compared to the draft version, it has matured a lot with added lifecycle calls and better application format, etc. Most excitingly, a healthy and fast-growing community is forming and we are seeing more and more ASGI servers running in production environments. At my company, we are serving a few million requests per day through ASGI running on <a href="https://github.com/django/daphne">Daphne</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Dispatch</a> is based on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, a popular ASGI web application framework, and apparently, Microsoft is <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26">using it</a> too.</p>

<p>I would humbly advise anyone building web services in Python to learn about ASGI. And the best way to learn something is to built things with it, so in this blog post, I’ll walk through the steps to build a micro web application framework that speaks ASGI. I hope it can help explain how ASGI works.</p>


<p>Before writing the first line of code, we need to have a basic understanding of what ASGI is and what we are building towards.</p>
<h2 id="how-asgi-works">How ASGI works</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple diagram showing how ASGI works at a high level.</p>
<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Client] --&gt;|HTTP, WebSocket, ...| B(ASGI Server)
	B --&gt; |scope, send, receive| C(ASGI application)
</code></pre>
<p>To put it in simple words, A browser(client), establishes a connection to ASGI server with a certain type of request (HTTP or WebSocket), the ASGI server then calls ASGI  application with information about the connection, encapsulated in a python dictionary called <code>scope</code>, and two callbacks, named <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, that the application can use to send and receive messages between server and client.</p>

<p>Here’s an example HTTP request scope</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"http_version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"server"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>8000</span><span>),</span>
    <span>"client"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>60457</span><span>),</span>

            <span>b"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.106 Safari/537.36"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"accept"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-encoding"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"gzip, deflate, br"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-language"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"en-US,en;q=0.9"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"cookie"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b'csrftoken=dDA2IAPrvgPc7hkyBSyctxDk78KmhHAzUqR0LUpjXI3Xgki0QrGEWazE3RGZuLGl'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might notice that <code>scope</code> is not too different from a WSGI <code>environ</code>. In fact, ASGI interface is very similar to WSGI interface, but instead of getting a <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> to send headers and using the return value of WSGI application as the response body, ASGI interfaces with the connection and allows us to receive and send messages multiple times during the lifecycle of the connection <strong>asynchronously</strong> until the connection is closed.  This allows a nice interface for both WebSocket and HTTP.</p>

<p>It’s also totally possible to wrap a WSGI application inside an ASGI application, just prepare a WSGI <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> based on <code>scope</code>, <code>receive</code>, and <code>send</code> then call the WSGI application and it would work. If you delegate that call into a thread pool or something similar, you just made your WSGI application asynchronous. This is roughly how Channels wraps around Django.</p>

<h2 id="define-asgi-framework">Define ASGI framework</h2>
<p>When I say ASGI framework I refer it as a framework that makes building ASGI application easier and this does not include the ASGI server part. I’m mentioning this because some of the earlier Python asynchronous web frameworks have their own server implementation that also takes over tasks such as parsing  HTTP requests, handles network connections, etc. We are not doing those in ASGI web framework. As a spiritual successor to WSGI, where web servers, such as Gunicorn and uwsgi, and web frameworks, such as Flask and Django, are separated, ASGI has this separation too.</p>

<p>So, what does an ASGI application look like?</p>

<h3 id="asgi-hello-world">ASGI Hello World</h3>
<p>A simple ASGI hello world application can be written as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>application</span><span>(</span><span>scope</span><span>,</span> <span>receive</span><span>,</span> <span>send</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>scope</span><span>[</span><span>"path"</span><span>].</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>or</span> <span>"world"</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.start"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"status"</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>b"content-type"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"text/plain"</span><span>],],</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.body"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"body"</span><span>:</span> <span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"more_body"</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>http.response.start</code> starts an HTTP response sending status code and response headers. In this example, it responds with the 200 OK status code and  has <code>content-type</code> set to <code>text/plain</code> in the headers.  <code>http.response.body</code> sends the response body, the <code>more_body</code> key tells the server if the response is finished. ASGI server might use this to know if a connection should be closed or automatically decide between a <code>content-length</code> header or a chunked encoding.</p>

<p>We can run the application with <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">uvicorn</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>uvicorn asgi-hello:application
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And you should be able to visit <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> and get <code>Hello, world</code>.Visiting <code>http://localhost:8000/tom</code> would get you <code>Hello, tom</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, uvicorn is pretty fast, a simple benchmark with <code>wrk -d10s http://localhost:8000/hi</code> on a 2018 lowest spec MacBook Air yields <code>Requests/sec:  27857.87</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this approach works with a simple hello world example, it’s not exactly convenient to write a more complex application this way. For one, it doesn’t do routing, if you want to respond differently for different paths, you’ll probably end up with a huge  <code>if ... else if ... else</code> clause. Secondly, having to write the ASGI message every time in the form of a python dict is quite arduous. Third, in a complex application, it gets harder to track the status of the connection, such as is the response started, is the response ended, should I start the response here, etc.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>With the new framework, I hope to be able to write an ASGI application like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>from</span> <span>aaf</span> <span>import</span> <span>aaf</span> <span># Another ASGI framework
</span><span>from</span> <span>aaf.routing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Router</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>aaf</span><span>([</span><span>router</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I hope this snippet of how I want the framework to look like is self-explanatory. But here are some of the key things I want to achieve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be able to handle HTTP response declaratively and imperatively.</li>
  <li>It should support Flask style routing with parameter parsing.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="connection-class">Connection class</h2>
<p>The <code>Connection</code> class will represent an ASGI HTTP or WebSocket connection. It’s a class that encapsulates the three basic elements in ASGI, namely <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, and expose some convenient methods and properties so that users don’t need to verbosely write out all the ASGI messages and parse everything, such as cookies and headers, from <code>scope</code>. But it should allow users to access the original <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> when they want to, so that the composability of ASGI applications is maintained. For example, it should allow user to delegate certain <code>connection</code>s to another ASGI application by calling <code>another_asgi_app(connection.scope, connectionn.asgi_send, connection.asgi_receive)</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple implementation of the <code>Connection</code> class.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Test-driven development was supposed to eliminate the need for independent testing. Alas, it doesn’t go far enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) earned a reputation of making software more robust. Does that mean you can fire all the testers? Spoiler: No.</p>
<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test-driven development</a> is a method for writing software in small chunks. You start with a test, then write functional code to make the test pass, and finally refactor the functional code to clean it up. The idea of TDD was proposed by <a href="https://amzn.to/3doabIA" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Beck</a> in the early 1990s, as part of Extreme Programming, an Agile software development methodology.</p>
<p>TDD is sometimes summarized as “Red, Green, Refactor.” The interfaces on many testing harnesses, such as JUnit (for Java) and NUnit (for .NET), show red lights when tests fail and green lights when tests pass. There’s another step to consider, however. You need to think about the desired behavior and carve out a small chunk of code – typically five lines – to implement next.</p>
<p>As proposed by Beck, in TDD you never write functional code until you have a failing test. Yet, it takes practice to learn to write the tests first (rather than after the fact); developers often have trouble shifting their habitual way of working. Writing the tests before the functional code just feels <em>wrong.</em> You do get used to it, though it may take months; by then it starts feeling <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development-tdd/">biggest benefit of TDD</a> is that it removes the fear of breaking your code. As you add unit tests and functional code, you also build <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/dont-fail-your-next-interview-know-what-differentiates-regression-testing-from-retesting/">a library of regression tests</a> that you run frequently. When you add a new feature, fix a bug, or refactor to clean up your code, running the tests again reassures you that you didn’t break anything. Or at least it confirms that you didn’t break any of the tests that <em>you</em> wrote.</p>
<h3>What do testers bring to the table?</h3>
<p>Software managers are sometimes tempted to eliminate or reduce software QA departments when the coders adopt TDD, on the grounds that the programmers are also writing tests. That decision usually is a mistake, because <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">testers provide value</a> outside of the developers’ unit tests.</p>
<p>Unit tests are only one of the kinds of tests needed to adequately cover modern code. TDD developers rarely write end-to-end integration tests. They may avoid writing unit tests that require significant setup or that rely on other software components, such as a populated database.</p>
<p>Dedicated testers are more likely than coders to take the time to perform exploratory (ad-hoc) testing, which can find bugs that weren’t imagined during the development of the code. Testers also come to the product with fresh eyes compared to the coders who have been immersed in the software for long hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, software developers often are not interested in setting up CI/CD tooling or in organizing the team’s tests into a master regression test. Testers consider all of that to be part of the job. Developers may not be involved in implementing shift left testing beyond TDD. &nbsp;For shift left testing, testers can gather information, help with requirements management, and help to define the acceptance criteria, before a single test or line of functional code is complete.</p>
<h3>What bugs do testers find that TDD doesn’t?</h3>
<p>Security is one large, important testing area that isn’t normally addressed by writing unit tests. Testers look for security flaws with automated vulnerability testing tools, manual security assessments, penetration tests, security audits, and security reviews.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for developers to write <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">unit tests to test GUIs</a>. Instead, testers use automation tools specific to the supported application environments, such as browsers, desktop applications, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Developers can have a hard time with hardware-dependent bugs, as the dominant way of working is for a coder to work on a single machine. QA departments often collect rooms full of varied computers and devices, as well as images of many operating system versions. An alternative way of testing on many different model devices is to use a crowd-sourced testing service.</p>
<p>While TDD can theoretically catch bugs in edge cases, they are called “edge cases” for a good reason. When a coder designs the tests for a function point, obscure edge cases may escape notice in the heat of the moment. Testers are more likely to find these than are the coders who wrote the software.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-module flaws can sometimes escape scrutiny in unit tests. They can easily arise when one programmer misunderstands the interface or boundary conditions of another programmer’s module. Cross-module bugs are often found during end-to-end testing and ad-hoc testing.</p>
<p>In summary, while there’s a lot to be said for TDD as a development practice, it doesn’t usually provide complete test coverage of your code. For that, you still need testers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever writes the test cases, it makes sense to follow established guidelines. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/best-practices-for-effective-test-case-writing/">These</a> might help.</p></blockquote>

June 25, 2020 | https://www.4alltech.com/2020/05/a-closer-look-at-frame-times-why-fps.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.4alltech.com/2020/05/a-closer-look-at-frame-times-why-fps.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><span><span>So FPS is, as it were, a total score, the number of images&nbsp;<em>per second.</em></span>&nbsp;<span>Since this does not say anything about the distribution of the images&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;that second, the fps score is unable to say anything about how smooth the experience actually is for the player.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span>
<p><span>It is therefore more interesting to look at the time it takes to render each frame (image).</span>&nbsp;<span>These are also known as&nbsp;<em>frame times</em>&nbsp;, and they are measured in milliseconds.</span>&nbsp;<span>A millisecond is one thousandth of a second and is often shortened to&nbsp;<em>ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>Because the images follow each other very quickly in an animation, this unit makes more sense than noting&nbsp;<em>0.001 seconds.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>If you want 60 fps without stutters at all times, no frame should take longer than 16.67 milliseconds to calculate and be displayed on your screen.</em></span><span>For 30 fps, your system can take it easy;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>there is a whopping 33.3 milliseconds.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you want to get 100 fps, that's just 10 milliseconds - less than a third of the time!</span></p>
<h2>
<span>The Achilles heel of the mean</span></h2>

<p><span>For frame times we therefore measure&nbsp;<em>per frame</em>&nbsp;the time it took to render that frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>Since each benchmark quickly takes a few minutes, we are talking about thousands of 'scores' (values).</span>&nbsp;<span>It would be very easy to calculate an average from all this data, but then we are effectively no further than with an FPS score;</span>&nbsp;<span>after all, an average says very little about the consistency and outliers within the series.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="361" data-original-width="600" height="384" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span>Which system is performing better now?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the averages, both systems arrive at 30 fps.</span>&nbsp;<span>On this basis, we therefore see no difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the graph, it is immediately clear that system B with its two outliers does not offer such a smooth experience as system A.</span></p>

<p><span>Now that we know that we should not focus on an average (fps), the question arises: what can be used?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we measure the frame times in a benchmark or test, and thereby collect&nbsp;<em>tens of thousands of</em>&nbsp;scores, how can these be made transparent?</span>&nbsp;<span>Making a graph for each second tested as above is a lot of work, and you probably already quit after ten pieces.</span>&nbsp;<span>To do this in a compact and efficient way, we use percentiles.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>A percentile is a term from the statistic, and is calculated by ordering all frame times from lowest to highest and dividing it into 100 parts of equal size.</span>&nbsp;<span>That way you will get a better overview of the distribution of all data.</span>&nbsp;<span>For example, if it is the 60th percentile, then 60 percent of all frame times is equal to or less than this number, and 40 percent higher.</span>&nbsp;<span>If a test shows that the 90th percentile is 13.3 ms, 90 percent of all measured frames are ready in 13.3 ms or faster.</span></p>

<p><span>Do you remember the previous graph ?</span>&nbsp;<span>Below are a similar chart with again one second of test data on two systems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="300" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span>The average of these two systems is again not that interesting, because they both achieve an average frame time of 33.3 ms which means 30 fps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>We get a better overview if we sort all scores in the chart from low to high as below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="301" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>With the increasing frame times in this graph, the picture is a bit less chaotic than the previous graph.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the order from low to high, the best (lowest) frame times are therefore on the left, and the worst (which cause the annoying stutters) on the right.</span>&nbsp;<span>This is also how a percentile graph works, only percentiles are used for the horizontal axis.</span>&nbsp;<span>A line graph is also used instead of a bar chart (the 'bars').</span>&nbsp;<span>Then the graph will look like this:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="323" data-original-width="600" height="344" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We know that frame times are preferably as low as possible, but especially that we want to see as few high frame times as possible.</span>&nbsp;<span>That sounds like the same thing, but there is a difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the example above, the game runs at 30 fps and the monitor shows 30 images per second, so there is 33.3 ms time to prepare per frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>In that case, the frames that are ready in less time have no extra value, they are not shown before.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you want your game to run as fast as possible, low frame times are desirable, but even then consistency is also important for the best experience.</span>&nbsp;<span>The higher frame times on the right of the graph are the cases that disrupt the smooth experience.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>
<span>Low frame times, high percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>When discussing frame times, the 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentile are commonly used values.</span>&nbsp;<span>Why?</span>&nbsp;<span>Because with this data, we can make a solid statement about how well a game or benchmark is running for most of the time.</span>&nbsp;<span>We are not just looking for the worst frame time, we want to know how consistent the experience is across the board.</span>&nbsp;<span>An incidental stutter is almost inevitable and often not fully predictable - and sometimes just a measurement error.</span></p>

<p><span>The 99th and 99.9th percentile is also regularly indicated with&nbsp;<em>1%</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>0.1%</em>&nbsp;<em>lows</em>&nbsp;at frame times&nbsp;<em>,</em>&nbsp;which is effectively the same (the 1 and 0.1 percent worst frame times) - it just rolls a bit easier.</span>&nbsp;<span>In addition, some publications convert the percentiles in frame times back to fps, in order to make the information more accessible.</span>&nbsp;<span>Many readers can usually imagine better at&nbsp;<em>75 fps</em>&nbsp;than at&nbsp;<em>13.3 ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>In itself we understand that choice, but it should be kept in mind that 'in' 75 fps (a second with 75 frames) an inconsistent follow-up of frames can still take place.</span>&nbsp;<span>This mainly depends on which percentile it concerns: converted 75 fps as 99th percentile is much more consistent than as 90th percentile.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Finally</span></h2>
<p><span>For those who examine frame times, a world of detailed information opens up.</span>&nbsp;<span>Compared to the&nbsp;<em>frames per second</em>&nbsp;measure, it is much more accurate to measure how smooth the animation is and how pleasant the gaming experience will be.</span>&nbsp;<span>Moreover, there are a variety of options for comparisons;</span>&nbsp;<span>not only determine what the better video card is, but also, for example, which processor is suitable for gaming, how much an overclocking on your cores or your memory makes, the difference between different driver versions and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>That the importance of frame times has been underlined with this article does not mean that the fps benchmark can be trashed.</span>&nbsp;<span>As long as frame times remain consistent, the proportions in relevant equations will remain the same</span></p>
<p><span><span>In this article we have talked about what exactly frame times mean, how they relate to fps, how the calculations are made, what the percentiles mean and how you can read and interpret all these test data.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you also want to get started and do these measurements on your own PC, programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/ocat/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7ywfCE3ogo8D8QpExdhs-ba5knw">OCAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-nC6YtO_Hj4jx-GwmEb9dFzOe0g">FrameView are</a>&nbsp;good options for logging in, but especially&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4raip_SAYtm11y0fc40AjzmlyRA">CapFrameX</a>&nbsp;is recommended to provide insight into the large amounts of data in an instant.</span></span></p>

				<p>You've probably heard of a Lean Startup approach to building a business, but what about a Lean DevOps approach to scaling your development team?</p><p>To explain the difference between traditional DevOps and Lean DevOps, let's start at a cloud's eye view and work our way down.</p><p>The definition of traditional DevOps, as defined by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=DevOps%20is%20the%20combination%20of,development%20and%20infrastructure%20management%20processes.">AWS</a>, is:</p><blockquote>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/traditional-devopscycle-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Lean DevOps makes a key distinction in the fact that it aims to not just bring velocity to the surface, but also simplicity. As such, Lean DevOps is defined as:</p><blockquote><em>Lean DevOps is a development philosophy that focuses on both velocity and simplicity via a combination of culture, best practices, and workflow automation tools.</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/lean-devops-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Not only is traditional DevOps a major challenge for small companies trying to compete for skilled people, but those same startups also have the most promising opportunity to scale DevOps as part of their organizational structure and culture. In doing so, DevOps can be optimized using a lattice-style team philosophy where generalists and specialists are both leveraged and nurtured.</p><p>And Lean DevOps works. The <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/state-of-devops-report/">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> showed that companies who have high performing DevOps programs deploy software not only <strong>200 times more frequently</strong>, but also have <strong>2,555 times faster lead times</strong> for their projects. In addition, they also <strong>recover 24 times faster from failed changes</strong>, with <strong>three times lower change fail rates</strong>.</p><p>That equates to not just faster development, but faster business. You’ll reach milestones, OKRs, and goals earlier, and before your competition does. Thus, bringing developer tools into the realm of revenue generation and not just cost savings.</p><h2 id="-300b-in-lost-developer-productivity">$300B in Lost Developer Productivity</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/dev-productivity_cto.ai-2.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Currently, DevOps is fragmented across innumerable tools and technologies. Developers have also been tasked with workflow automation, but this burns valuable time that could be used to build features for paying customers.</p><h3 id="often-you-ll-see-two-main-devops-challenges-">Often you’ll see two main DevOps challenges:</h3><ol><li><strong>Many companies struggle to adopt DevOps practices.</strong></li><li><strong>DevOps tools are far more complex than ever before.</strong></li></ol><p>That’s why <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">$300 billion in developer productivity is lost every single year</a> within growing development teams.</p><p>Technical leaders know that, as their teams grow, it is critical to invest in the workflows that their teams require to work. However, it can be too time-consuming to allocate their critical internal resources.</p><p>That’s why a Lean DevOps approach is so important. It allows teams to remain lean, automate repeated workflows, and use tools and behaviors that increase simplicity and velocity.</p><h2 id="the-10x-engineer-is-dead">The 10X Engineer Is Dead</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/10x-engineer-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And that’s why the 10X engineer is dead. Or, more appropriately, they never existed. However, a team’s ability to have a 10X impact is still very much alive.</p><p>Taking a Lean DevOps philosophy can work the same magic, but instead, focus on making a team of five engineers 2X as productive.</p><p>All they need to do is build the right culture, utilize industry best practices, and implement the best tools.</p><p>You can also consider building an organizational structure that unblocks your team like a lattice formation (pictured above) or holocracy-style team makeup that promotes a flat organization with limited bureaucracy and decentralized management.</p><p>These are frameworks for encoding autonomy, agility, and purpose-alignment into your organization's DNA.</p><h2 id="5-ways-to-build-a-culture-of-delivery">5 Ways to Build a Culture of Delivery</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/teamvelocity-process-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, how do I move to the Lean DevOps light, you ask?

Implement a rollout plan and lay out the education with it.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Create a platform for success. </strong></strong></strong>Lead by example to live and breath your new-found Lean DevOps philosophy.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>ICE: Impact + Confidence / Effort. </strong></strong></strong>Balance your workload by debating with data and leveraging your highest value initiatives.</li></ol><p>Take the time necessary to get buy-in for a culture shift from your team. It's never easy, but if you do it right in the beginning the effects will become much more ingrained in your sprints.</p><h2 id="scaling-with-lean-devops">Scaling with Lean DevOps</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/devops-over-time-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Remember, as your team scales you’ll move from a flatter organization to an Agile matrix one.</p><p>This will also affect your team velocity as process complexity increases.</p><p>So, as you scale, here are ways to stay within the Lean DevOps methodology:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Stay flat, fewer managers. </strong></strong></strong>Maintain accountability through transparency via tools like Slack and its companion app marketplace.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Strategic vertical workstreams. </strong></strong></strong>Track product milestones in tools like Jira to provide visibility and a longer-term vision.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Holistic horizontal specialization. </strong></strong></strong>Think about research and development, security, and codebase specialization as wide thoughts that span business functions.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Don’t lose the ability to build a generalist culture. </strong></strong></strong>A team of polymaths will aide your problem solving and creative thinking.</li></ul><p>At the end of the day, there is no perfect process, but a combination of assets.</p><p>Tools with bottom-up adoption, a flat organizational structure to speed things up, adaptability, and a balance between velocity and stability are your targets.</p><p>Welcome to the delivery culture of Lean DevOps.

These are the last rows in that table:</p><pre>1992 0
1996 0
2000 1
2004 1
2008 0
2012 0
2016 1
</pre><p>The full table can be found <a href="https://turingbotsoftware.com/data/presidents_numbers.txt">here</a>.</p><p>Then, to generate the model, we used the Symbolic Regression software TuringBot. The chosen search metric was classification accuracy, and a 70/30 train/test split was used to reduce the chance of overfitting. The split was sequential: the oldest years were used for the training, and the most recent ones were used for the cross-validation.</p><p>These are the models that were found, along with their corresponding out-of-sample classification accuracies:</p>              <p><img src="https://turingbotsoftware.com/images/president_model.png"></p><p>In these formulas, x is the election year (2012, 2016, 2020, etc). The best formula turned out to be <span>ceil(cos(0.996479*x*((-0.0830122)*(log(x)*(1.58953e-05-x)))))</span>. Its accuracy in the training split is 94.11%, and in the test split 87.5%.</p>              <h2>The prediction for 2020</h2><p>Calculating the formula above at x = 2020, we find that the result is 1. This means that the formula predicts that a Republican is likely to win the elections.</p>              <h2>The prediction for the next elections</h2><p>We can also calculate the formula for the next elections. These are the results:</p><pre>2024: Democrat
2028: Republican
2032: Republican
</pre><p>It should be noted that the accuracy of the model is expected to degrade the further you go into the future.</p>              </div></div>]]>

<section data-level="1" id="camera-on-or-off-a-ux-approach-to-video-meeting-fatigue">

<section data-level="3" id="video-conferencing-is-the-new-office-living-room-dinner-table-doctors-office-"><h3>Video conferencing is the new office / living room / dinner table / doctors office...</h3>
<p>As the spaces of our social lives have transitioned to a limited number of software interfaces, fatigue and burnout has skyrocketed taxing our mental health and productivity. While video conferencing apps are keeping us employed and connected, they are not prepared to handle this mass shift in our daily routines and social interactions. </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="what-makes-video-conferencing-so-different-"><h3>What makes video conferencing so different?</h3>
<p>When we spend our days sitting in our makeshift offices and personal spaces staring at our coworkers, friends, doctors, teachers and families (and don’t forget ourselves!) in little boxes on our screens we miss so much of the social experience of real face to face interactions. We’re unable to read body language, engage in normal social rituals, have serendipitous conversations—to move!</p>
<p>We’re also responding to a unending amount of new information that our brains need to process—our personal lives surrounding us at home, the apartments and houses of our coworkers and their personal lives happening around them, the host of distractions on our desktops and the lure of almost unnoticeable multitasking. </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-ui.jpg" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="can-the-design-of-our-meeting-software-help-"><h3>Can the design of our meeting software help?</h3>
<p>As a UX designer working to build a video conferencing platform, it’s been crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the medium in hopes of easing some of the fatigue with features designed not to replicate in person communication but to uncover and build on the strengths of a relatively new space.    </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="improving-our-new-space-the-meeting-room"><h3>Improving our new space - The meeting room</h3>
<p>We spend so much care and effort creating the physical spaces we occupy, and these spaces have a known effect on our mental health as well as our productivity, creativity and sociablility. A black box filled with poor quality images littered with icons can feel like spending all day in a messy room with no windows—of course we’re exhausted after a day of video meetings! But what can we do to make these new rooms feel like  sleek, light filled rooms with all the personal touches that we invest so much thought into? </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-meetingroom.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The furniture, if you will, of these new spaces is entirely different. Instead of tables, whiteboards and light switches we have new furniture that has to replicate everything else missing from in person interaction—all those icons littered about. Unmute is the desk of a virtual meeting room.</p>
<p>Designing meetings rooms for Team.video has strived to take into account interior design principles as well as UX best practices. Does a glaring red mute icon create more stress and visual clutter than it provides important functional information? Our process has been one of many iterations, focusing on light colors, subtle gradients and subdued accents.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="camera-on-or-off-"><h3>Camera on or off?</h3>
<p>We’ve never been more aware of the green light at the top of our screens. In almost daily research sessions over the past few months I've yet to encounter a team that has found the golden solution to the camera on or off question. </p>
<p>Companies that had a camera on policy have switched to camera optional and those with a camera optional approach have switched to camera on. Some teams use cameras only for smaller meetings or only require those speaking to use video. </p>
<p>Camera off can feel less personal but also removes the need to process so many different faces and backgrounds at once. While being on camera for the majority of a day is incredibly exhausting and not always necessary for productive work meetings. </p>
<ul>
<li>There is probably no golden solution, but some design attention can greatly improve both sides of the coin. </li>
<li>A more aesthetically pleasing camera off view that still includes the face of a coworker and a signal when/that they are speaking. </li>
<li>Flexible layouts for different scenarios—one speaker, a handful of speakers, screenshare brainstorm etc. </li>
<li>The option to hide or minimize your own video. </li>
<li>Blurred or custom backgrounds for camera on mode—which can be a lot of fun and also a potential new distraction. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/cameraonoroff.png" alt=""></p>

</section>

<section data-level="3" id="meetings-start-very-abruptly"><h3>Meetings start VERY abruptly</h3>
<p>All of a sudden you’re face to face with an unfamiliar coworker, from your bedroom...and the person who called the meeting is running late. This scenario is unique to telecommuting. Maybe you regularly walk to the conference room with a coworker, or you introduce yourself politely and take the first few minutes of a meeting to fill your water bottle while everyone else arrives. </p>
<p>All of this is much more awkward over video. Small talk is less natural with mute/unmute issues, lack of non verbal cues and often bandwidth time delays. Widespread goals to keep meetings efficient encourage us to get straight to the point, which can be jarring. </p>
<p>How can UX help those first few meeting minutes? </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to know who is already in the meeting before you join so you can decide if you want to be one on one with a C level you’ve never met. </li>
<li>Arrive looking (and sounding!) your best with a pre-meeting ‘haircheck’ where meeting goers can check their audio/video before entering the meeting</li>
<li>Low effort social interaction built in to the welcome minutes. At team.video we’ve implemented an optional word game that early arrivers can play against each other in lieu of or in addition to any amount of small talk. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-haircheck.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-game.jpg" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="keep-trying-new-things-"><h3>Keep trying new things!</h3>
<p>Design is always about observing, trying and testing. With team.video we’ve been able to explore some ideas larger companies have not and we’d love to hear any thoughts or issues that you’ve encountered in our software or others! </p>

In my experience doing software consulting, I’ve seen and worked on some projects where the founders take 2 - 3 months to launch the first version of their product. That’s too much time and effort sunk into a project that may not work.</p><h2>Why you need to get your Minimum Viable Product out ASAP</h2><p>The problem is that most people are not comfortable with launching a minimum viable product. Founders are often creative people who love to explore and dive into “wouldn’t it be cool if”s. This habit can result in a continuous loop of adding features, even before the first version of your product is released.</p><p>Perfectionism can often get in the way of execution, and I’ve fallen for this trap many times. My first product (SideQuest) took me four months to build and launch. To continue developing an untested product is, to put it bluntly, arrogant. Here’s why: it assumes that what you are making is vital for your customer. It assumes that you know what’s best for your user. You don’t.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>No founder knows until they launch their startup and get feedback from people. Your first version is likely going to suck; it might even miss the mark or be utterly irrelevant to the market. You need to get any negative and positive signals from your target market as soon as possible.</p><p>That was what we tried to do with MeetButter. Everyone on our team has had experience getting burnt by wasting time, runway, effort, and emotion building products or features that were inconsequential in the larger picture.</p><p>Here’s the story of how we managed to build and ship MeetButter in three weeks.</p><h3>Step 1 - Identification</h3><figure>

    <figcaption>It started with a thread</figcaption>
  </figure><p>The first spark for MeetButter was a Slack thread discussing the pains teachers and educators were dealing with transitioning their classrooms from offline to online. We found that there was a very human problem with online video conferencing - they only allowed the focus to one speaker at a time. It was awkward interrupting the speaker, and this caused some participants to feel reluctant to engage. The discussion thread grew, with more anecdotes and feedback from our friends and family.</p><p>Identifying the problem is the first step. It’s crucial to figure out the groups of people that are facing the same issues and gathering feedback from them. </p><h3>Step 2 - Investigation</h3><p>We decided to take this asynchronous discussion and organize a synchronous brainstorm session. During this particular session, we discussed three significant problems that we had identified and were interested in solving. On the list was the aforementioned “video conferencing” - which eventually became MeetButter.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Breaking down the current video conferencing experience</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Some significant points were brought up by everyone on the team, and we found that these were problems that each one of us had faced while doing online video conferencing:</p><ol><li>It’s difficult to indicate an interest in speaking, reply to the current conversation, or add to the discussion without feeling like you’re interrupting the current speaker.</li><li>It’s impossible to transition smoothly between one speaker to the next. Sometimes mid-sentence pauses are met with several speakers trying to enter into the conversation at once. Combined with lag, this can get quite awkward.</li><li>The avoidance of awkwardness causes some people to remain quiet.</li><li>The loudest voice in the room problem - some people naturally dominated discussions.</li><li>Social cues are almost non-existent when your entire team gets boxed into tiny windows on-screen and are only visible from their shoulder up.</li></ol><p>The purpose of this brainstorm was not to narrow down into solutions, but it was to dive deep into the problems.</p><div><p>Adam is typing something... (Click to reveal)</p><p><img src="https://adamthewan.com/static/adam-head-0b2b466e69071c2bd52efa9911165bc6.png"></p></div><h3>Step 3 - Sketching</h3><p>After the brainstorm session, we discussed some ideas on how to tackle the problem. Solutions can seem pretty vague, and usually, what happens is that several keywords get thrown around. For us, it was “queue,” “overlay,” and “polls.” It’s good to note that people often visualize keywords differently and form very different concepts in their heads. </p><p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Sketching is an essential skill to learn for any founder, as it’s the best medium to transfer your ideas with a low signal-noise ratio. People often misunderstand your words. If you’re not good at drawing, it’s good to learn how to sketch out a prototype digitally using free tools like Figma. I have even used Google Slides to build a low fidelity prototype for a client once! Sometimes I even screenshot parts of other apps and combine them into a Frankenstein of an image - anything to help bridge the gap between your vision and their imagination.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Based on the feedback and ideas from the team, this was the very first sketch for MeetButter that I built using Figma. After sharing it on our team Slack, we held a meeting to discuss the steps moving forward. We decided to cut out some features and instead focus on the queuing functionality as we were able to test it internally during our daily standup calls.</p><h3>Step 4 - Prototyping</h3><p>I won’t go into too much detail about how we built the prototype. This step will be different for every team: some teams will opt to do a no-code prototype using tools like AirTable and Google Forms; some will choose to do a “simulated” prototype using Figma or Zeplin; some will opt to build a fully functioning albeit minimal prototype using code. We decided to do the latter as it was the fastest for me to code something quickly.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Once you have your prototype, you need to get it in front of some test users. Finding test users can be tricky.  Ideally, the test users should be from within your team; this was the case for us with MeetButter. It meant that we were building a product for ourselves, that we were part of our target market. Building a product to solve your problems has some apparent benefits: </p><ol><li>It creates a shorter and more efficient feedback loop.</li><li>It’s easier to innovate on issues you face</li><li>It somewhat validates your market.</li></ol><p>If you are building a product that’s not for yourself, I’d suggest finding at least ten people within your networks who can become your loyal test users.</p><p>MeetButter was also super easy to integrate into our daily workflow. All we had to do was open up the web app during our regular standup calls. It’s essential to build some sort of feedback loop. I sent a Google Form to the participants of the meeting to gather initial feedback as soon as the meeting ended - it’s best to strike while the iron is hot. We also had several Slack threads discussing additional ideas that came up as we continued testing.</p><h3>Step 6 - Reiteration</h3><p>After testing our prototype, we collected the feedback and went back to the drawing board. At this point, you have to make a clear decision with your prototype - do you continue to reiterate, or do you kill the project? We found that our prototype worked quite well, and although we were skeptical, there was a sense that we were onto something. We started using the prototype in every meeting, so it was hard to deny that our team internally found it useful.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>We repeated the process of designing, reiterating, and receiving feedback several times. Our testing group grew from our internal team of five people out to our friends within our social circles.</p><h3>Final Step - Launch</h3><p>After a few rounds of iterations, our prototype slowly shed its pieces and morphed into something resembling a product. As soon as we exhausted our immediate networks, we knew that the next step was to launch MeetButter beyond internal test users.</p><p>I began to lay the groundwork for a codebase that could grow into a scalable project. Our tech stack ended up being the following:</p><ul><li>Frontend - NextJS with Redux and GraphQL</li><li>Backend - A mix of Firebase and an Express server that’s powered by Apollo GraphQL and Sequelize</li><li>Infrastructure - We used Netlify and AWS to deployment</li></ul><figure>

  </figure><p>Several factors allowed us to build and ship MeetButter quickly.</p><p>Firstly, we were fortunate to have had the experience and the skills to execute quickly. We didn’t run into many technical limitations, as each one of us had filled the significant roles that were needed. These roles include design/UI UX, software development, and marketing/networking.</p><p>Secondly, we tried to follow the best practices for idea generation. The brainstorm that led to MeetButter wasn’t the first one that we had together. It was probably our fifth brainstorm session after getting together as a team as Project Phoenix. With a lot of practice, we were able to build a set of best practices to have productive brainstorm sessions, get feedback, and reiterate.</p><p>Thirdly, we were close to our target market, which allowed us to test fast and slowly expand our test userbase.</p><p>Fourth, we threw perfection out the window. Our prototype didn’t work 100% of the time, had a bunch of bugs, and built with the bare minimum UI. Despite this, we still used it every single day for our video calls. It was good …</p></div></div>

You theoretically could switch your backend to run ARM Linux. However, this would take months - renting out ARM instances, re-building all repositories, and a tense switch over. What if your hosting provider doesn't offer ARM instances with the same system requirements as x86_64? What if you complete this migration and find it runs at half the speed?</p><p>Worse, it might be impossible if your images include files downloaded off the internet, as those are often only compiled for x86_64.</p><div><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/phantomjs-615e9c8bc9d2deb5ca62a4533c1299d6.png"></p><p>An example of a Docker command that will only work on x86_64.

Getting a new laptop isn't enough justification to switch your backend architecture.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>run Docker remotely</strong>. You set up an x86_64 Linux server, then allow Docker to connect to it remotely. From then on, all Docker commands instead run on the server. This is also supported in Docker, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-remote-docker-server-to-speed-up-your-workflow">here</a> is a tutorial on setting it up. This is what heavy Docker users will want to do.</p><h2>VirtualBox</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/virtualbox-c37e4cc82b13d3c1c080f7ced273ae45.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>VirtualBox won't work.</strong></p><p>VirtualBox is a <strong>hypervisor</strong>.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>BLEU is a standard algorithm for evaluating the machine translations against the human translations. At first I thought it should be very straightforward to use. However, it turns out that there are a lot of caveats.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to show the BLEU algorithm in detail and talk about the caveats.</p>

<h3 id="english-translation-example">English Translation Example</h3>

<p>We will use the following examples to illustrate how to compute the BLEU scores.</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the cat the cat on the mat</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the the the the the the the the</p>

<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>

<p>We count each of the ngram in the candidate sentence whether it has shown in any of the reference sentences, gather the total counts for each of the unique ngram, sum up the total counts for each of the unique ngram, and divided by the number of ngrams in the candidate sentence.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 1. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the unigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Unigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The unigram precision is 7/7 = 1.0 for example 1.</p>



<p>We then try to compute the bigram precision for example 1.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Bigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>

    <td>cat the</td>

    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>

  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>

  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the bigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Bigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>2</td>

  <tr>
    <td>cat the</td>
    <td>0</td>

  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique bigrams in the candidate sentence is 5, and the total number of bigrams in the candidate sentence is 6. The bigram precision is 5/6 = 0.833 for example 1.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-1">Example 2</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 2. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>

    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the unigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Unigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 8, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 8. The unigram precision is 8/8 = 1.0 for example 2.</p>



<p>We then try to compute the bigram precision for example 2.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Bigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>the the</td>
    <td>0</td>

    <td>the the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the bigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Bigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the the</td>
    <td>0</td>

</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique bigrams in the candidate sentence is 0, and the total number of bigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The bigram precision is 0/7 = 0 for example 2.</p>

<h4 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h4>

<p>We can see from example 1 and 2 that unigram precision is very easy to be over-confident about the quality of the machine translation. To overcome this, clipped count and modified precision were proposed.</p>

<h3 id="modified-precision">Modified Precision</h3>

<p>For each unique ngram, we count its maximum frequency in each of the reference sentences. The minimum of this special count and the original count is called the clipped the count. That is to say, the clipped count is no greater than the original count. We then use this clipped count, in place of the original count, for computing the modified precision.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-2">Example 1</h4>

  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Unigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
    <th>Clipped Count</th>

    <td>mat</td>

  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of clipped counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 5, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The unigram modified precision is 5/7 = 0.714 for example 1.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of clipped counts for the unique bigrams in the candidate sentence is 4, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 6. The bigram modified precision is 4/6 = 0.667 for example 1.</p>

<p>The total number of clipped counts for the unique bigrams in the candidate sentence is 0, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 8. The unigram modified precision is 2/8 = 0.25 for example 2.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>Compared to precision, we found that modified precision is a better metric, at least for unigrams.</p>

<h3 id="bleu">BLEU</h3>

<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>

<p>BLEU is computed using a couple of ngram modified precisions. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $p_n$ is the modified precision for $n$gram, the base of $\log$ is the natural base $e$, $w_n$ is weight between 0 and 1 for $\log p_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n = 1$, and BP is the brevity penalty to penalize short machine translations.</p>



<p>where $c$ is the number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus. Here the best match length is the closest reference sentence length to the candidate sentences. For example, if there are three references with lengths 12, 14, and 17 words and the candidate translation is a terse 13 words, ideally the best match length could be either 12 or 14, but we arbitrary choose the shorter one which is 12.</p>



<p>Usually, the BLEU is evaluated on corpus where there are many candidate sentences translated from different source texts and each of them has several reference sentences. Then $c$ is the total number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the sum of the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus.</p>



<p>It is not hard to find that BLEU is always a value between 0 and 1. It is because BP, $w_n$, and $p_n$ are always between 0 and 1, and</p>



<p>Usually, BLEU uses $N = 4$ and $w_n = \frac{1}{N}$.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-3">Example 1</h4>

<p>We have computed the modified precision for some of the ngrams. It is not hard to compute the others. Concretely, we have</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 7$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>We plugin these values to the BLEU equation, the BLEU is</p>



<p>We further compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.467 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-3">Example 2</h4>

<p>Similarly,</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 8$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>When we plugin these values to the BLEU equation, actually we would need to compute $\log 0$ which is not mathematically defined. We use a small number $10^{-100}$ instead of $0$ for $p_2$, $p_3$ and $p_4$. The BLEU is</p>



<p>We further also compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<span>1.2882297539194154e-231</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<p>Note that in the above two examples, due to the candidate sentence is long and we only have one translation in the corpus, thus $\text{BP} = 1$. In practice, there could be scenarios where $\text{BP} &lt; 1$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In some scenarios, BLEU does not score the translation very well, especially for those short translations with few reference sentences. For example,</p>



<p>Chinese: 你准备好了吗？</p>

<p>Reference 1: are you ready ?</p>

<p>Candidate: you are ready ?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>bleu</span><span>)</span>
<span>1.133422688662942e-154</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is actually a very good machine translation to me. However, the BLEU score is 0, which means that the machine translation is totally wrong.</p>



<p>In NLTK, you are allowed to provide <a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.html#nltk.translate.bleu_score.SmoothingFunction">smoothing functions</a>. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>reference_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"are you ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>bleu</span> <span>=</span> <span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>sentence_bleu</span><span>(</span><span>references</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>reference_1</span><span>],</span> <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>candidate</span><span>,</span> <span>weights</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>],</span> <span>smoothing_function</span><span>=</span><span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>SmoothingFunction</span><span>().</span><span>method7</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>bleu</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4002926439114545</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, the value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.4, which is magically higher than the vanilla one we computed without using smoothing functions.</p>



<p>However, one should be always cautious about the smoothing function used in BLEU computation. At least we have to make sure that the BLEU scores we are comparing against are using no smoothing function or the exact same smoothing function.</p>

<p>This is a collection of random thoughts regarding the application of
permacultural ideas to the computer world.</p>

<p>Some have tried to connect these worlds before (<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PermaCulture">WikiWikiWeb's Permaculture
article</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent
Beck</a>'s short-lived idea of <a href="https://www.softwarequotes.com/showquotes.aspx?id=559&amp;name=Kent%20Beck">Permaprogramming</a>),
but these have mostly concentrated on enhancing software engineering
practices with some ideas from gardening. I am more interested in the aspect
of cultural and ecological permanence. That is, how to give computers a
meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a
meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere.</p>

<h2>1. Problem</h2>

<p>Over the last few hundred years of human civilization, there has been a
dramatic increase in the consumption of artificially produced energy. In the
overarching story, this is often equated with "progress".</p>

<p>In the computer world, this phenomenon gets multiplied by itself:
"progress" facilitates ever greater densities of data storage and digital
logic, thus dramatically exploding the availability of computing resources.
However, the abundance has also caused an equivalent explosion in
wastefulness, which shows in things like mindblowingly ridiculous hardware
requirements for even quite trivial tasks.</p>

<p>At the same time, computers have been failing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">utopian
expectations</a>. Instead of amplifying the users' intelligence, they rather
amplify their stupidity. Instead of making it possible to scale down the
resource requirements of the material world, they have instead become a
major part of the problem. Instead of making the world more comprehensible,
they rather add to its incomprehensibility. And they often even manage to
become slower despite becoming faster.</p>

<p>In both computing and agriculture, a major issue is that problems are too
often "solved" by increasing controllability and resource use. Permaculture
takes another way, advocating methods that "let nature do the work" and thus
minimize the dependence on artificial energy input. Localness and
decentralization are also major themes in the thought.</p>

<p>What makes permacultural philosophy particularly appealing (to me) is
that it does not advocate "going back in time" despite advocating a dramatic
decrease in use of artificial energy. Instead, it trusts in human ingenunity
in finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition
into co-operation, waste into resources. Very much the same kind of creative
thinking I appreciate in computer hacking.</p>

<p>The presence of intelligent life in an ecosystem can be justified by its
strengthening effect. Ideally, humans could make ecosystems more flexible
and more resilient because of their ability to take leaps that are difficult
or impossible for "unintelligent" natural processes. The existence of
computers in a human civilization can be justified by their ability to
augment this potential.</p>

<h2>2. Physical resources</h2>

<h3>2.1. Energy</h3>

<p>Permaculture emphasizes resource-sensitivity. Computers primarily use
electricity, so to them resource-sensitivity primarily means 1) adapting to
changes in energy conditions and 2) using the available energy wisely.
Today's computers, even mobile ones, are surprisingly bad at this. This is
partially due to their legacy as "calculation factories" that are constantly
guaranteed all the resources they "need".</p>

<p>Intense non-urgent computation (such as long machine learning batches)
would take place only when a lot of surplus energy is being produced or
there is a need for electricity-to-heat conversion. This requires that the
computer is aware of the state of the surrounding energy system.</p>

<p>At times of low energy, both hardware and software would prefer to scale
down: background processes would freeze, user interfaces would become more
rudimentary, clock frequencies would decrease, unneeded processors and
memory banks would power off. At these times, people would prefer to do
something else than interact with computers.</p>

<p>It is often wise to store energy for later use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">Flywheels</a>
are a potential alternative to chemical batteries. They have similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy densities</a>
(MJ/kg) but require no rare-earth materials and last for decades or
centuries instead of mere years.</p>

<h3>2.2. Silicon</h3>

<p>IC fabrication requires large amounts of energy, highly refined machinery
and poisonous substances. Because of this sacrifice, the resulting
microchips should be treasured like gems or rare exotic spices. Their active
lifespans would be maximized, and they would never be reduced to their raw
materials until they are thoroughly unusable.</p>

<p>Instead of planned obsolescence, there should be planned longevity.</p>

<p>Broken devices would be repaired. If the community needs a kind of device
that does not exist, it should preferrably be built from existing components
that have fallen out of use. Chips should be designed open and flexible, so
that they can be reappropriated even for purposes they were never intended
for.</p>

<p>Complex chips should have enough redundancy and bypass mechanisms to keep
them working even after some of their internals wear out. (In a multicore
CPU, for instance, many partially functioning cores could combine into one
fully functioning one.)</p>

<p>Chips that work but whose practical use cannot be justified can find
artistic and other psychologically meaningful use. They may also be stored
away until they are needed again (especially if the fabrication quality and
the storage conditions allow for decades or centuries of "shelf life").</p>

<p>Use what is available. Even chips that do "evil" things are worth
considering if there's a landfill full of them. Crack their DRM locks,
reverse-engineer their black boxes, deconstruct their philosophies. It might
even be possible to reappropriate something like Bitcoin-mining ASICs for
something artistically interesting or even useful.</p>

<p>Minimized on-chip feature size makes it possible to do more computation
with less energy but it often also means increased fragility and shorter
lifespans. Therefore, the densest chips should be primarily used for
purposes where more computation actually yields more. (In entertainment use,
for example, a large use of resources is nothing more than a decadent
esthetic preference.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing">Alternatives
to semiconductors</a> should be actively researched. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328395242_Towards_fungal_computer">Living
cells</a> might be able to replace microchips in some tasks sometime in the
future.</p>

<p>Once perfectly clean ways of producing microchip equivalents have been
taken to use, the need for "junk fetishism" will probably diminish.</p>

<h3>2.3. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Whenever bright external light is available, displays should be able to
use it instead of competing against it with their own backlight. (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display">Transflective
LCD</a>)</p>

<p>Personally-owned computers are primarily for those who dedicate
themselves to the technology and thus spend considerable amounts of time
with it. Most other people would be perfectly happy with shared hardware.
Even if the culture and society embraced computers more than anything else,
requiring everyone to own one would be an overkill.</p>

<h2>3. Observation and interaction</h2>

<p>The first item in many lists of permacultural principles is "Observe and
interact." I interpret this as primarily referring to a bidirectional and
co-operative relationship with natural systems: you should not expect your
garden to be easily top-down controllable like an army unit but accept its
quirkiness and adapt to it.</p><h3>3.1. Observation</h3>

<p>Observation is among the most important human skills computers can augment.
Things that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe can be brought
within human cognitive capacity by various computational processes. Gathered
information can be visualized, slight changes and pattern deviances
emphasized, slow processes sped up, forecasts calculated. In Bill Mollison's
words, "Information is <em>the</em> critical potential resource. It becomes
a resource only when obtained and acted upon."</p>

<p>Computer systems should also make their own inner workings as observable as
possible. If the computer produces visual output, it would use a fraction of
its resources to visualize its own intro- and extrospection. A computer that
communicates with radio waves, for example, would visualize its own view of
the surrounding radio landscape.</p>

<p>Current consumer-oriented computing systems often go to ridiculous
lengths to actually prevent the user from knowing what is going on. Even
error messages have become unfashionable; many websites and apps just
pretend everything is fine even if it isn't. This kind of extreme
unobservability is a major source of technological alienation among computer
users.</p>

<p>The visualizations intended for casual and passive observation would be
pleasant and tranquil while making it easy to see the big picture and notice
the small changes. Tapping into the inborn human tendency to observe the
natural environment may be a good idea when designing visualizers. When the
user wants to observe something more closely, however, there is no limit in
how flashy, technical and "non-natural" the presentation can be, as long as
the observer prefers it that way.</p>

<h3>3.2. Yin and yang hacking</h3>

<p>Traditional computer hacking is often very "yang". A total understanding and
control of the target system is valued. Changing a system's behavior is
often an end in itself. There are predefined goals the system is pushed
towards. Optimization tends to focus on a single measurable parameter.
Finding a system's absolute limits is more important than finding its
individual strengths or essence.</p>

<p>In contrast, "yin" hacking accepts the aspects that are beyond rational
control and comprehension. Rationality gets supported by intuition. The
relationship with the system is more bidirectional, emphasizing
experimentation and observation. The "personality" that stems from
system-specific peculiarities gets more attention than the measurable specs.
It is also increasingly important to understand when to hack and when just
to observe without hacking.</p>

<p>The difference between yin and yang hacking is similar to the difference
between permaculture and …</p></div>

<h2>ResolutionKit</h2>
<p>
A framework for change.
</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the longest time, I've been afraid to speak up about my story with App Review, fearing I'd put my popular app at risk. I've now decided that being transparent and sharing my experience to help others is worth it, so here it goes:👇</p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1274356729224892416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
I admire Apple, and I believe the world is a better place because of them. As a developer, I’ve made my career on their platform and I’m grateful for it.
But I have some criticism. I’m&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;here to talk about my story, the 30% Apple developer cut, the App Review process, or to challenge any of their guidelines.
I want to talk about&nbsp;<em>transparency</em>, and <em>accountability</em>.
</p>
<p>
For far too long, developers have been discouraged from being able to share their rejection stories with the world.
"If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps", used to be the official guidance.
The risk too great for most, the fear of retribution overwhelming.
And so the stories have largely remained in the shadows, with only a few exceptions.
But there’s another, critical reason why such stories rarely see the light of day, one that hasn’t received enough attention:
</p>
<blockquote><b>Apple is systematically erasing our stories.</b></blockquote>

<p>
Unless we’re talking about your most recent submission, all communication you have <em>ever</em> sent or received through the "Resolution Center" is inaccessible to you.
Rejection notices, appeal results, anything you might want to reference to better understand previous about your product - it's all gone.
Unless you have meticulously and manually kept copies of all correspondence, what happened in the past will forever stay in the past. But why should it?
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to see why Apple is doing this.
It <em>is</em> hard, however, to see a reason that benefits anyone but Apple.
In doing so, they gain more peace of mind, less worry about consistency and correctness in applying the public guidelines.
The appeal mechanism helps them improve, but only to the extent that Apple deems necessary.
If we ever wanted to know how well Apple is enforcing the guidelines, we have to take their word for it.
But who guards the guardians, when App Review’s accountability to the world has been intentionally reduced to the bare minimum?
</p>
<p>
Transparency is not always the solution.
We can’t expect Apple to be open about their future product plans, for example.
But when they communicate with developers, they should do so like everyone is watching - every time.
And to get there, the <em>possibility</em> that everyone might find out needs to always be on the table.
</p>
<p>
So Apple, please help us see App Review as a reliable ally.
Let us access our past communications with you - including phone call records if we choose to.
Show us that you want to be accountable for what you communicate to developers. There may be some legal challenges, but transparency is a prerequisite to accountability.
It’s only then that we can begin to have a fair and honest discussion with you about the actual process and guidelines.
Because until then, we’re in the shadows.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood-dark.svg" alt="Banner"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood.svg" alt="Banner"></p></div><p>Basics of providing content over the internet are fairly straight-forward: Browsers will send requests to your
server, and your server responds with some HTML potentially linked to some JS and CSS.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>How and when you generate those HTML, CSS and JS content is however an entirely different thing. You might want
to prepare them all in advance and have your server just serve them (pre-rendering), 
you might have your server generate them on the fly (SSR), 
or you might have your server ship some code to the browser that will then generate them (client-side rendering, SPAs). 
You might even generate requested content on the server and ship it with the code that 
would generate subsequently requested content on the browser (isomorphic).</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>There is one particular approach pretty suitable for blogs: you prepare most of the content before hand, then
serve it alongside code that would wire-in interactive bits and generate fully dynamic components. This is called
the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a>, and it is the approach used by <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a> and
<a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> for content generation. In this post, we go through the reasons we chose this
approach, and how we implemented it.</p><hr><p>To better understand why we chose <em>JAMStack</em> for <code>coding.blog</code> and how we set our further design goals, its good
to first have a general overview of methods of web content generation/delivery:</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Pre-Rendering</p><p>Pre-rendering simply means preparing your content before-hand, i.e. in the <em>build stage</em>. This is the fastest
delivery method, and allows you to simply use a CDN instead of writing a server for serving your content.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering-dark.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p></div><p>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</p><p>Instead of preparing the content, you can generate them on-the fly on your server, in response to each request.
This is perhaps useful when your content needs to change based on incoming requests, and perhaps you need to
get some data from some API to be able to create the content. However, this approach is obviously much slower
than pre-rendering.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr-dark.svg" alt="SSR"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr.svg" alt="SSR"></p></div><p>Client-Side Rendering and SPAs</p><p>Highly interactive and dynamic content means you need to generate content on the client-side. To avoid having
content-generation code in multiple places (which is hard to maintain / scale), you could instead conduct all
content generation on the client browser, having your server just ship the content generation code.</p><p>To avoid shipping the content generation code for each page of your site, you can also take control of the 
navigation on the client side, which leads to a <em>Single Page Application</em> (SPA for short). This is the basis
of all modern front-end frameworks.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr-dark.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p></div><p>Client-side rendering means the user should wait extra time for being able to see the content, since typically
servers are faster at generating content. It also messes up with SEO, since crawlers might not be able to even
get the content in its full form (since they are not browsers) and so might not be able to properly index it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Isomorphic Apps</p><p>To overcome these issues without spreading the content generation code in multiple places, the concept of <em>isomorphic apps</em>
was introduced. The idea is to basically run the same code both on the server and on the client, while also shipping
the code itself to the client alongside content rendered on the server.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic-dark.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p></div><p>The complexity of isomorphic apps inevitably brings extra constraints and overheads. For example, you need to re-hydrate
the content on client-side, which means you are limited on how you manipulate that content (e.g. for React SSR, React needs
to maintain full control of the DOM tree). These complexities also make it harder to optimize performance since many more
components and their interactions are affecting it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>JAMStack Apps</p><p>Another approach would be to pre-render all your static content and then ship the code for filling in dynamic/interactive
parts to the client. This would allow for the same delivery speed of pre-rendering without sacrificing interactivity
of the content. It also implies a clear separation in the code-base as opposed to isomorphic apps: there is code that
pre-renders stuff, and there is code that goes to client and makes stuff interactive.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack-dark.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p></div><p>The JAMStack architecture is specifically suitable for mostly static content, which makes it a perfect choice
for likes of <strong>CODEDOC</strong> (which is for documentation / guides about codes) and <code>coding.blog</code> (which is for blogs about
coding / programming). The simplicity of the workflow allows for easy optimization and high degrees of interoperability
and extensibility.</p><hr><p>While the JAMStack architecture was the most suitable for <a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> and <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a>,
it mandates a split of content generation code into bits that are executed at build stage and bits that are
shipped to the client. This can quickly add a lot of complexity/overhead for any growing project, so we had to
find a solution that addressed this particular issue.</p><p>In other words, we needed to:</p><ul><li>have a shared component system</li><li>easily mark client-side components so that they are not pre-rendered</li><li>seamlessly where these components were to be rendered in the DOM tree</li><li>conveniently and efficiently collect and bundle the code of these clients</li><li>conveniently attach these bundles to pre-rendered content</li></ul><marker><br>

</marker><p>Additionally, we wanted a minimal toolchain and stack with maximum extensibility and interoperability. Generally
we wanted knowledge of HTML/JS/CSS to suffice for serious customization, which made a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>-based 
syntax an optimal choice for our component system (specifically as Typescript supports it out of the box).</p><p>However, we couldn't use a library like React (or any VirtualDOM based solution) since its sensitivity to external changes to 
the DOM tree meant limitations on how the DOM is manipulated by extensions, either during pre-rendering or on the client.
Besides, we needed our content to be as light-weight as possible, which simply prohibited relatively heavy-weight
operations such as VirtualDOM diffing.</p><hr><p>To satisfy our design goals, we created a JSX-based rendering tool which directly sits on top of DOM APIs.
This is called <a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-html">CONNECTIVE HTML</a>, and on a basic level
is merely a wrapper of DOM APIs that allows using them via JSX:</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><p><span>1</span><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Renderer <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@connectv/html'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>2</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>const</span> renderer <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Renderer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>4</span>renderer<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hellow World!</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><br></code></pre><p>For more dynamic/reactive content, we simply added plugins to allow rendering

however, you generally do require familiarity with some reactive state management library to be able to 
properly create interactive components. RxJS might not be the easiest such library for people to dive in, but
considering its widespread usage and the overall performance gain, we felt this was a compromise well worth it.</p><blockquote><p>Fun fact: Historically CONNECTIVE HTML was developed first and CODEDOC as a tool to document it. However
as a result of popularity of CODEDOC and subsequently <code>coding.blog</code>, I haven't found the time to use it 
for its original purpose yet.</p></blockquote><hr><p>To meet the remainder of our design goals, we created a tool named <a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-sdh">CONNECTIVE SDH</a>. 
SDH stands for <em>Static/Dynamic HTML</em>, which means this library allowed us to seamlessly create both static (pre-rendered)

This problem is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> and one of the algorithms which can be used to learn those classes from data is called Logistic Regression.</p><p>In this article we'll take a deep dive into the Logistic Regression model to learn how it differs from other regression models such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear-</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a>, how to think about it from an intuitive perspective and how we can translate our learnings into code while implementing it from scratch.</p><h2 id="linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression">Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression</h2><p>If you've read the post about <a href="https://philippmuens.com/linear-and-multiple-regression-from-scratch/">Linear- and Multiple Linear Regression</a> you might remember that the main objective of our algorithm was to find a best fitting line or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> respectively.</p><p>To recap real quick, a line can be represented via the slop-intercept form as follows:</p><p>\[ y = mx + b \]</p><p>Here, \(m\) represents the slope and \(b\) the y-intercept.</p><p>In Linear Regression we've used the existing data to find a line in slope-intercept form (a \(m\) and \(b\) combination) which "best-fitted through" such data.</p><p>Extending the slope-intercept form slightly to support multiple \(x\) values and multiple slopes (we'll use \(\beta_n\) instead of \(m_n\)) yields the following:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>This "scaled-up" slope-intercept formula was used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> model to find the \(\beta\) and \(b\) values for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> which "best-fitted" the data. Once found we were able to use it for predictions by plugging in \(x\) values to get respective \(y\) values.</p><p>Linear Regression models always map a set of \(x\) values to a resulting \(y\) value on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a> scale. This means that the \(y\) value can e.g. be \(0\), \(42\) or \(5.023.212\). How would we use such a Regression model if our \(y\) value is categorical such as a binary value which is either \(0\) or \(1\)? Is there a way to define a threshold so that a value such as \(42\) is assigned to the category \(1\) while a small value such as \(0.002\) gets assigned to the category \(0\)?</p><p>That's where Logistic Regression comes into play. With Logistic Regression we can map any resulting \(y\) value, no matter its magnitude to a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Let's take a closer look into the modifications we need to make to turn a Linear Regression model into a Logistic Regression model.</p><h2 id="sigmoid-functions">Sigmoid functions</h2><p>At the very heart of Logistic Regression is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>. A Sigmoid function is a class of functions which follows an S-shape when plotted.</p><p>The most prominent Sigmoid function is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">Logistic function</a> which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre Francois Verhulst</a> to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">population grown</a>. It's mathematically described via this formula:</p><p>\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \]</p><p>Don't be intimidated by the math! Right now all you need to know is that this function takes any \(x\) value and maps it to a \(y\) value which ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Plotting the function for a range of \(x\) values proofs this claim and results in the aforementioned S-shape curve:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zsigmoid_result.png"></figure><p>Note that the function gets closer and closer to the \(y\) value \(0\) or \(1\) as the \(x\) values get smaller or larger respectively. Also note that the \(x\) value \(0\) results in the \(y\) value \(0.5\).</p><p>This is exactly what we need. with this function we're able to "squish" any number, no matter its magnitude into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\). This makes the function outcome predictable which is useful when we later on define threshold values to associate function outputs with classes.</p><p>Let's turn the function into code:</p><pre><code>def sigmoid(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

assert sigmoid(0) == 0.5</code></pre><p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>: Although there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function#Examples">different Sigmoid functions</a> to choose from, a lot of people use the name "Sigmoid function" when talking about the Logistic function. We'll adhere to this convention and use the term "Sigmoid function" as a synonym for Logistic function.</p><h2 id="from-linear-regression-to-logistic-regression">From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression</h2><p>Now that we've learned about the "mapping" capabilities of the Sigmoid function we should be able to "wrap" a Linear Regression model such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> inside of it to turn the regressions raw output into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Let's translate this idea into Math. Recall that our Multiple Linear Regression model looks like this:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>"Wrapping" this in the Sigmoid function (we use \(\sigma\) to represent the Sigmoid function) results in the following:</p><p>\[ y = \sigma(\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b) \]</p><p>Easy enough! Let's turn that into code.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to implement the underlying Multiple Linear Regression model. Looking at the Math it seems to be possible to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> to calculate the \(\beta\) and \(x\) part to which we then add the single \(b\) value.</p><p>To make everything easier to calculate and implement we'll use a small trick. Multyping a value by the identify \(1\) yields the value so we prepend \(1\) to the \(x\) values and \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values. This way we can solely use the dot-product calculation without the necessity to add \(b\) separately later on. Here's the mathematical formulation of that trick:</p><p>\[ \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix} \vec{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} b \\ \beta_1 \\ ... \\ \beta_n \end{pmatrix} \]</p><p>\[ y = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{m} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \beta_i = x_1 \times \beta_1 + ... + x_n \times \beta_n \]</p><p>Once we've calculated the dot-product we need to pass it into the Sigmoid function such that its result is translated ("squished") into a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Here's the implementation for the <code>dot</code> function which calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a>:</p><pre><code>def dot(a: List[float], b: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    return sum([a_i * b_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)])

assert dot([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 70</code></pre><p>And here's the <code>squish</code> function which takes as parameters the \(x\) and \(\beta\) values (remember that we've prepended a \(1\) to the \(x\) values and the \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values), uses the <code>dot</code> function to calculate the dot-product of \(x\) and \(\beta\) and then passes this result into the Sigmoid function to map it to a value between \(0\) and \(1\):</p><pre><code>def squish(beta: List[float], x: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(beta) == len(x)
    # Calculate the dot product
    dot_result: float = dot(beta, x)
    # Use sigmoid to get a result between 0 and 1
    return sigmoid(dot_result)

assert squish([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 1.0</code></pre><h2 id="the-intuition-behind-the-0-1-range">The intuition behind the 0-1 range</h2><p>We've talked quite a lot about how the Sigmoid function is our solution to make the function outcome predictable as all values are mapped to a \(0\) - \(1\) range. But what does a value in that range represent? Let's take a look at an example.</p><p>The following is a data set which describes how long students have studied for an exam and whether they've passed the exam given the hours they've studied.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>

<p>Some commenters (/u/coderintherye chain notably) on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23630201">HN post</a> of the <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/what-silicon-valley-doesnt-understand-about-agriculture/">original article</a> brought up good points that I wanted to expand on and provide some additional context. Also for clarification: although farming is truly global, most ‘farming’ I refer to pertains to the United States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States">which is an agriculture juggernaut</a>), but in my experience should reasonably translate across agriculture zones (pending equivalent laws and climatic factors).</p>



<p><strong><em>There is ample VC money for Ag startups</em></strong></p>



<p>The original intention of the article wasn’t to bemoan the lack of capital available for <a href="https://agiowa.com/portfolio/">founders focused on agriculture</a> (there is actually plenty of capital–check out <a href="https://agfundernews.com/">AgFunderNews</a> for examples of successful raises). Instead, it is a recommendation for anyone entering the space to understand the industry and its history to harness existing synergies rather than try and swim upstream. Watching capital go to ‘solved’ problems is painful, because there are many opportunities for a unicorn ag startup if aimed in the correct space. Vertical farming for non-vegetables (or fruits) is likely dead-on-pitch. Yes, vertical farming <em>is</em> and <em>could be</em> successful, but those markets are very specific and probably 10x smaller than people think. Nice businesses no doubt, but not market shaping behemoths VCs are after. Agriculture is rightfully a commodity and the market will brutalize ideas/companies that can’t turn a profit. One bad year (droughts in 2011 and 2012 in the US Midwest) from external forces can absolutely put farmers out of business. Indoor farming has all of the risks of outdoor ag–and more! Indoor farming requires water (whose source can dry up and get shut off unexpectedly, just like a drought), has pests, and requires artificial lighting (power outage for 5 days? Uh oh). Herbicides (and sometimes pesticides) are actually an example of innovation pre-SV. Alternate technologies (i.e mechanical) didn’t work or were uneconomical for the time period; thus, chemical solutions seemed to thrive (glyphosate/glufosinate resistant corn/soy/wheat/cotton/sugar beets &amp; <a href="https://agrilife.org/lubbock/files/2020/02/BtTraitTable_FEB_2020.pdf">BT resistance for insects</a>). I predict in next 5-20 years we see that flip, where chemical and biological solutions fall out in favor of mechanized solutions (who wouldn’t want a semi-autonomous robot pulling weeds in fields in favor of a chemical solution that is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-roundup-cancer-lawsuits-n1232026">open to litigation</a>)? We just have too little understanding of 2nd and 3rd order effects of disrupting nature at this scale (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49660-6">gene drives included</a>, as promising as they appear) using these incredibly effective chemicals.</p>



<p><strong><em>Financing in the Heartland</em></strong></p>



<p>I won’t speak of financing agricultural operations in a municipality not located in the United States, as even understanding the US situation takes time and effort. Let’s be clear though: Most farmers <em>need</em> to borrow capital just to operate for a given year (hence, there is a note called an ‘operating loan’) and financing agriculture operations is more and more important as the size of farms increases. They buy seed, fertilizer, feed, chemicals, etc. to be able to produce an output to then (hopefully) sell at a profit–all to rinse and repeat. Buying big expensive new tractors ($300k+ USD), buildings to store the machines, grain storage, fencing, animal houses–all generally require a loan. Because of the huge cost to purchase these necessities, financing institutions generally need to have a <em>very</em> thorough understanding of the operation (Only farm 160 acres of corn,soy,or wheat? Good luck buying equipment). So bankers have become very good (not perfect) at evaluating and swaying farming practices to ensure maximum likelihood of repayment. Seriously, check of the used auction prices of ag machinery sometime–<a href="https://www.bigiron.com/Lots/2011JohnDeere8335RMFWDTractor-3">this tractor</a> is 10 years old and commands the price of a new Tesla. Is ag financing a place that needs disruption? Likely no because ag lending has evolved hand-in-hand in rural communities where agricultural production is the predominant industry. Because they evolved with ag, they likely have already captured the +EV that startups tend to seek because their very existence depends on it. So where <em>are</em> the value proposition? I know nothing of their founding, but the previous auction link is from <a href="https://www.bigiron.com/">Big Iron Auctions</a> and those founders likely understood ag (“hey, there is a robust secondary market for farm machinery”) and created on-line version of it–with what appears to be great success. I’d imagine these on-line secondary markets exist in Brazil and Eastern Europe given there agriculture exposure. </p>



<p><strong><em>Success Stories</em></strong></p>



<p>There are some truly incredible examples of engineering and innovation in agriculture that focus on the mechanization and scale <em>that already exists</em>. Transplanting vegetables in the Central Valley (CA) used to be labor intensive–<a href="https://www.planttape.com/">this brilliant solution solved that</a>. Auto-steer <a href="https://www.fieldbee.com/blog/fieldbee-tractor-autosteer-versus-other-systems/">systems</a> that leverage machinery that already exists. Sometimes the innovation is statistical/computation (<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">genomic prediction has revolutionized dairy cattle</a>) Starting businesses is hard and agriculture is no different.</p>



<p>Stay away from vertical farming–unless you plan on growing saffron or figure out a way to cultivate morel mushrooms!</p>

June 25, 2020 | https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<div>
										
										<p>The Go team recently released a new post in the Go blog called
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">Â«The Next Step in GenericsÂ»</a> and updated the design draft on
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">Â«Type ParametersÂ»</a> (a long one).</p>

<p>In the current post I’m going to describe how to port Java’s Stream to Go 2 Generics.</p>

<p>Let’s make it straightforward â€” define the Stream:</p>

<pre><code>type Stream(type Type) struct {
	slice    []Type
	parallel bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declare a new type using type parameter <code>Type</code> with underlying slice <code>[]Type</code>.</p>

<p>And let’s have a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type)(slice []Type) *Stream(Type) {
	return &amp;Stream(Type){
		slice: slice,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter <code>(type Type)</code> after name of function and in type declaration is Type Parameter.
The type parameter is required whenever we are going to use generics.</p>

<p>Now we can implement core functions of a typical stream:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Reduce</li>
<li>ForEach</li>
<li>Collect</li>

<li><p>AnyMatch/AllMatch/NoneMatch</p>

<pre><code>func (stream *Stream(Type)) Filter(predicate func(Type) bool) *Stream(Type) {
	filtered := []Type{}
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		if predicate(item) {
			filtered = append(filtered, item)
		}
	}
	stream.slice = filtered
	return stream
}

func Map(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(Type) R) *Stream(R) {
	slice := make([]R, len(stream.slice))
	for i, item := range stream.slice {
		slice[i] = predicate(item)
	}
	return Of(slice)
}

func Reduce(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(R, Type) R) R {
	var result R
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		result = predicate(result, item)
	}
	return result
}

func (stream *Stream(Type)) ForEach(predicate func(Type)) *Stream(Type) {
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		predicate(item)
	}
	return stream
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that Map and Reduce functions are not declared on <code>Stream(Type)</code>. It’s one of unsolved problems of current generics
design draft â€” parametrized methods are not permitted.</p>

<p>It means that we can have a function that receives type <code>A</code> and returns type <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func foo(type A, B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<p>But we can’t declare a parametrized method on type <code>Struct(A)</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>func (s Struct(A)) foo(type B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>This design draft does not permit methods to declare type parameters that are specific to the method. The receiver may
have type parameters, but the method not add any type parameters.
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md#no-parameterized-methods">Quote from the updated design draft</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s time for the cherry on top â€” <code>Stream(Type).Collect()</code>.</p>

<p>The signature of Collect function will be pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>func Collect(type Type, Col)(
	stream *Stream(Type),
	collector collector.Collector(Type, Col),
) Col
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that now we have two type parameters â€” one for original type that was used for creating a stream and another one
for resulting collection.</p>

<p>Here is a interface for a typical collector that consists of four functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Supply()</code> â€” a function that creates and returns a new result container.</li>
<li><code>Accumulate()</code> â€” a function that folds a value into a mutable result container.</li>
<li><code>Combine()</code> â€” a function that accepts two partial results and merges them. This is going to be used only in parallel mode.</li>

<li><p><code>Finish()</code> â€” while in Java this method converts from an intermediate type to the final result type, but in order to save
the simplicity of the implementation, it will return the same type.</p>

<pre><code>type Collector(type Type, Col) interface {
	Supply() Col
	Accumulate(Col, Type) Col
	Finish(Col) Col
	Combine(Col, Col) Col
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have the interface, we need an implementation. But since we want to allow developers to add
their own implementations without declaring new types, we need a constructor that will accept functions, think of it
like <code>http.HandleFunc()</code> which is often used to wrap functions and returns <code>http.Handler</code>.</p>

<p>We will declare a new constructor for <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> like we did for <code>Stream(Type)</code> that will return unexported
implementation of <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> that will just call the given functions:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type, Col)(
	supply func() Col,
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col,
	finish func(Col) Col,
	combine func(Col, Col) Col,
) Collector(Type, Col) {
	return impl(Type, Col){
		supply:     supply,
		accumulate: accumulate,
		finish:     finish,
		combine:    combine,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we also have to specify <code>(Type, Col)</code> for <code>Collector</code> even though we specified it later <code>impl(Type, Col)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>impl(Type, Col)</code> type is going to be a holder of functions that implements the <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>type impl(type Type, Col) struct {
	supply     func() Col
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col
	finish     func(Col) Col
	combine    func(Col, Col) Col
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Supply() Col {
	return collector.supply()
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Accumulate(collection Col, item Type) Col {
	return collector.accumulate(collection, item)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Finish(collection Col) Col {
	if collector.finish == nil {
		return collection
	}
	return collector.finish(collection)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Combine(collection1, collection2 Col) Col {
	return collector.combine(collection1, collection2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we’re good, now let’s declare a simple collector that is going to convert a <code>Type</code> to <code>Map[Key]Value</code> â€” <code>ToMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func ToMap(type Type interface{}, Key comparable, Value interface{})(
	mapper func(Type) (Key, Value),
	accumulator func(Value, Value) Value,
) Collector(Type, map[Key]Value) {
	return Of(
		func() map[Key]Value {
			return map[Key]Value{}
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value, item Type) map[Key]Value {
			key, value := mapper(item)
			now, _ := table[key]
			table[key] = accumulator(now, value)
			return table
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			return table
		},
		func(table1, table2 map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			for k2, v2 := range table2 {
				v1, _ := table1[k2]
				table1[k2] = accumulator(v1, v2)
			}
			return table1
		},
	)
}
</code></pre>

<p>An interesting thing about this function is that while it has three separated type parameters, it returns
<code>Collector(Type, map[Key]Value)</code> that uses only two type parameters.</p>

<p>Note that we need to specify Type Constraint for Key <code>comparable</code> in order to use it as key of a map otherwise it just
wouldn’t work.</p>

<p><code>ToMap</code> expects two functions on input:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mapper <code>func(Type) (Key, Value)</code> â€” receives an original element and returns two values: first one is going to be used as key
of the map, and the second one is going to be used as the value of the map[key]</li>
<li>Accumulator <code>func(now Value, update Value) Value</code> â€” receives current value of map[key] and new value <code>update</code> that have to be
somehow accumulated into <code>now</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how it will work out on practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Declare a simple type that will describe a movie and a score that a user gave to the movie:</p>

<pre><code>type MovieVote struct {
	Name  string
	Score int
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Create a stream of slice of some movies and user votes:</p>

<pre><code>items := stream.Of(
	[]MovieVote{
		{Name: "A", Score: 1},
		{Name: "A", Score: 2},
		{Name: "B", Score: 9},
		{Name: "B", Score: 10},
		{Name: "B", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
		{Name: "C", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
	},
)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let’s convert them into <code>map[Name]SumOfScore</code>:</p>

<pre><code>result := stream.Collect(
	items,
	collector.ToMap(MovieVote, string, int)(
		func(movie MovieVote) (string, int) {
			return movie.Name, movie.Score
		},
		func(total, score int) int {
			return total + score
		},
	),
)
fmt.Println(result)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The mapper returns name as key and score as value</li>
<li>The accumulator sums total and current score</li>
</ul>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>map[A:3 B:27 C:22]
</code></pre>

        <p>Back with a post after 6 years of silence. If you had to parse a microsecond-resolution epoch timestamp as quickly as possible, how would you do it?  We’ll take a look at using compiler intrinsics to do it in log(n) time.</p>


        <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it’s json, maybe it’s a csv file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csv">timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// ???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="the-native-solution">The native solution</h3>

<p>Let’s start with what’s available, and compare. We have
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/atoi"><code>std::atoll</code></a> , a function
inherited from C,
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream"><code>std::stringstream</code></a>
, the newer C++17
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/charconv"><code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code></a> header, and
by request
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/reference/basics.html"><code>boost::spirit::qi</code></a>.
I’ll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/benchmark">Google Benchmark</a> to
measure the performance, and to have a baseline let’s compare against loading
the final result into a register - i.e. no actual parsing involved.</p>

<p>Let’s run the benchmarks! The code is not important here, it just shows what is being benchmarked.</p>

<p>Wow, <code>stringstream</code> is pretty bad. Not that it’s a fair comparison but parsing
a single integer using <code>stringstream</code> is 391 times slower than just loading our
integer into a register.  <code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code> and <code>boost::spirit</code> do a lot better by
comparison.</p>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we’re trying to parse, and we
don’t need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster?  Just how much time
is spent in validation?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-naive-solution">The naive solution</h3>

<p>Let’s write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>inline</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_naive</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>noexcept</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s actually not bad for a simple for loop. If such a simple solution is
able to beat a standard-library implementation, it means there’s quite a lot of
effort that goes into input validation. As a sidenote - if you know your input,
or can do simpler validation you can get some significant speedups.</p>

<p>For further solutions and benchmarks, let’s ignore the standard library
functions. We should be able to go much faster than this.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s slightly better again, but we’re still processing a character at a time.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-byteswap-insight">The byteswap insight</h3>

<p>Let’s draw out the operations in the unrolled solution as a tree, on a
simplified example of parsing ‘1234’ into a 32-bit integer:</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-unrolled.png">

<figcaption><p>Unrolled solution graph of operations for ‘1234’</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We can see that the amount of multiplications and additions is linear with the
amount of characters. It’s hard to see how to improve this, because every
multiplication is by a different factor (so we can’t multiply “in one go”), and at
the end of the day we need to add up all the intermediate results.</p>

<p>However, it’s still very regular. For one thing, the first character in the
string is multiplied by the largest factor, because it is the most significant
digit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a little-endian machine (like x86), an integer’s first byte contains the
least significant digits, while the first byte in a string contains the most
significant digit.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-byteswap-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>Looking at the string as an integer we can get closer to
the final parsed state in fewer operations - see how the hex representation is
<strong>almost</strong> what we want</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now to reinterpret the bytes of a string as an integer we have to use
<code>std::memcpy</code> (<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1307">to avoid strict-aliasing
violations</a>), and we have compiler
instrinsic <code>__builtin_bswap64</code> to swap the bytes in one instruction. The
<code>std::memcpy</code> will get optimized out, so this is a win so far.</p>

<p>But now that we have an integer that kind of, sort of looks like what we want,
how do we get it across the finish line without too much work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-divide-and-conquer-insight">The divide and conquer insight</h3>

<p>From the previous step, we end up with an integer whose bit representation 
has each digit placed in a separate byte. I.e. even though one byte can
represent up to 256 values, we have values 0-9 in each byte of the integer.
They are also in the right little endian order. Now we just need to “smash”
them together somehow.</p>

<p>We know that doing it linearly would be too slow, what’s the next possibility?
<strong>O(log(n))</strong>! We need to combine every adjacent digit into a pair in one step,
and then each pair of digits into a group of four, and so on, until we have the
entire integer.</p>

<p>After I posted the first version of this article, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gr18ig/faster_integer_parsing/frx9agb">Sopel97 on
reddit</a>
pointed out that the byteswap is not necessary. Combining adjacent digits works
either way - their order doesn’t matter.  I realized that it helped me with the
next insight, but could be omitted for the final code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key is working on adjacent digits simultaneously. This allows a tree of
operations, running in O(log(n)) time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This involves multiplying the even-index digits by a power of 10 and leaving the
odd-index digits alone. This can be done with bitmasks to selectively apply
operations</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-mask-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>By using bitmasking, we can apply operations to more than one digit at a time, to combine them into a larger group</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Let’s finish the <code>parse_8_chars</code> function we started earlier by employing this
masking trick. As a neat side-effect of the masking, we don’t need to subtract
<code>'0'</code>, since it will be masked away.</p>

<h3 id="the-trick">The trick</h3>

<p>Putting it all together, to parse our 16-digit integer, we break it up into two
chunks of 8 bytes, run <code>parse_8_chars</code> that we have just written, and benchmark it!</p>

<figure>

    </canvas>

</figure>

<p>Not too shabby, we shaved almost 56% off of the unrolled loop benchmark! Still,
it feels like we are manually doing a bunch of masking and elementwise
operations. Maybe we can just let the CPU do all the hard work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-simd-trick">The SIMD trick</h3>

<p>We have the main insight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combine groups of digits simultaneously to achieve O(log(n)) time</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a 16-character, or 128-bit string to parse - can we use SIMD? Of
course we can! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple
Data</a>, and is exactly what we are looking
for. SSE and AVX instructions are supported on both Intel and AMD CPUs, and
 they typically work with wider registers.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics
Guide</a> to find
the right compiler intrinsics for the right SIMD CPU instructions.</p>

<p>Let’s set up the digits in each of the 16 bytes first:</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check out [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/roadmap" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>] to see what’s in the plans</li>
  <li>Read about our [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles" title="Principles">principles</a>] to understand Foam’s philosophy and direction</li>
  <li>Read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/contribution-guide" title="Contribution Guide">contribution-guide</a>] guide to learn how to participate.</li>

<p><em>Like passive income, those articles are generating a steady (albeit small) traffic to our app. But what's powerful about this traffic is that its super high-quality people. Only passionate people will find your articles, and when they do, they'll check out your app as well. </em></p>
<h3 id="quora-twitter-answer-to-questions">Quora &amp; Twitter: Answer to questions</h3>
<p>Create a company account and start replying to questions related to what you're doing. Twitter has a really good advanced search feature and Quora will suggest you more than enough questions you can reply to. If you spend a few hours each week generating good content on those platforms, you'll get a steady stream of clicks to your landing page as well. </p>

<h3 id="pioneer-app">Pioneer.app</h3>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a>  is an online accelerator that you can join for free. Every week, you submit a progress update and other users will give you feedback. This is a free way to get a few clicks to your app from startup founders. </p>
<h3 id="get-listed-on-10words-betalist">Get listed on 10words &amp; Betalist</h3>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://10words.io/">10words</a> and  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.nat.app/betalist.com">BetaList</a> are like a small Product Hunts. They are much smaller, you can expect around 50 clicks to your website for each. Still worth something! </p>
<h3 id="list-your-startup-on-indie-hacker-makerlog">List your startup on Indie Hacker &amp; Makerlog</h3>
<p>Those are two cool communities. If you're active, you'll definitely get some attention and users! </p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getmakerlog.com/">MakerLog</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.nat.app/indiehackers.com">Indie Hacker</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="product-hunt-ship">Product Hunt Ship</h3>
<p>Product Hunt has a place for upcoming apps called <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship">Ship</a> </strong>, I've not found it to be very useful, but it can get you a few additional users. </p>
<h2 id="growth-hacks">Growth hacks</h2>
<p>That's where stuff gets exciting. Use these growth hacks with moderation, there is a fine line between marketing and spamming. </p>
<h3 id="product-hunt-phantombuster-twitter">Product Hunt + PhantomBuster + Twitter</h3>
<p>If there are already a few apps on ProductHunt that are similar to what you're building, consider using  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-growth-hacked-my-way-to-500-waiting-list-subscribers-9612933fd3">this growth hack</a>. I've used it extensively myself. </p>
<h3 id="buy-targeted-email-lists">Buy targeted email lists</h3>
<p>I've built a tool myself that lets me scrape email addresses from founders on Indie Hacker. What's powerful is that you can filter by every filter available on Indie Hacker (revenue, location, business model, ...). You can use it to buy an email list here and use a tool like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gmass.com/">Gmass</a> or Streak to reach out.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrapeindiehacker.app/">Buy a list here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't recommend just sending the same email to everyone as this will impact your reputation. Instead, send personalized mass emails. It does take a bit longer, but it's worth every second considering the impact it will have on response rate and trust.</p>

<p>There are many chrome extensions out there that have tons of users but that are not maintained anymore. You can buy one for very cheap that is related to what you do and advertise your business on there. I bought  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-contacts-opener/pjpambjkhcilibnmeihhfgdkhfelbdkj">Google Contacts Opener</a>  and it's been generating significant traffic to our website ever since. </p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-not-be-doing">What you should not be doing</h2>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>It will cost you too much. Just don't think about it. In the early days, ads are not the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="launch-on-product-hunt">Launch on Product Hunt</h3>
<p>You've got only one shot at this, it better be big. You don't want to launch on Product Hunt before having built a mature product. Product Hunt is not for the launching phase, it's for the growth phase.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> is a better place to start.</p>
<h3 id="my-startup-s-traffic">My startup's traffic</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of who visited our website recently. This will give you a better idea of what you should focus on.

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	
<p>It seems that coding skills are becoming less and less of a barrier to building and launching a successful application.</p>
<p>No-code tools have offered everyone from small businesses to enterprises the opportunity to achieve digital transformation both simply and sustainably. In the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johneverhard/2019/01/15/what-really-is-low-codeno-code-development/#61935a6f2a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words of Forbes contributor John Everhard</a>, no-code, as well as often-associated low-code, solutions help “build powerful applications that can scale for any organization—without writing any code.”</p>
<p>Everhard further discussed in his article the powerful impact that no-code tools, also known as codeless tools, can have. With these types of software, IT teams no longer need to spend 60% of their time keeping their current systems working. Instead, no-code solutions help companies maintain a competitive edge over their peers with up to a 75% improvement on time to market.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have taken note of the “no-code movement” as well, with <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/08/gartner-lcap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner predicting</a> that low-code application platforms (LCAP) will account for 65% of application development activity by 2024. Enterprises seem to be taking note as well, whether by <a href="https://www.testcraft.io/testcraft-joins-perforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring codeless tools</a> or by releasing no-code capabilities of their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is a list of different tools to keep on your radar in the no-code space. These tools cover every stage of application development, although there are other solutions that are not covered here, such as industry-specific solutions and payment applications.</p>

<p>I have twice migrated large JavaScript apps to PureScript. At CitizenNet we replaced Angular with Halogen, and at Awake Security we’ve replaced most of a React application with PureScript React. Both companies have seen a dramatic drop in bugs in production.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to replace React due to PureScript’s <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> libraries. The React mental model fits well with a strongly-typed, pure functional language like PureScript (or Reason), and using the same underlying library means that components can be shared between languages with little modification.</p>

<p>At Awake Security we share internationalization, a Redux store and middleware, and much more in an code base where PureScript regularly imports JavaScript and JavaScript regularly imports PureScript.</p>

<p>The best way to rewrite a significant app from one language to another is incrementally, while it runs. At first the new language can take over logically isolated parts of the app: the management dashboard, or the chat window, or a form. But eventually you must mix components from both languages together – for example, to support shared global state.</p>

<p>At this point you can’t just let the new language take over a DOM node. You need to support simple, clear features for intermixing the languages. Fortunately, you can transform the interface of idiomatic PureScript code into idiomatic JavaScript (and vice versa). With <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> you can write business logic in PureScript but easily interoperating with the larger React ecosystem and your existing code.</p>

<p>In this article I will demonstrate how to replace part of a React application with simple components written in PureScript. Along the way, I’ll share best practices for making this interop convenient and dependable. The examples will be simple, but the same techniques also apply to complex components.</p>

</ol>

<p>I encourage you to code along with this article; no code is omitted and dependencies are pinned to help ensure the examples are reproducible. This code uses Node <code>v11.1.0</code>, Yarn <code>v1.12.0</code>, and NPX <code>v6.5.0</code> installed globally, and PureScript tooling installed locally.</p>

<p>Peter Murphy has <a href="https://github.com/ptrfrncsmrph/purescript-react-tutorial">implemented the ideas in this article using React Hooks</a> if you’d like to see this in action.</p>




<h2 id="let-s-write-a-react-app-in-javascript">Let’s write a React app in JavaScript</h2>

<p>We are going to write a tiny React application which shows a few counters, and then we’re going to replace its components with PureScript. The resulting JavaScript code will be indistinguishable, aside from imports, from the original, and yet it will all be PureScript under the hood.</p>

<p>Let’s follow the official React docs in using <code>create-react-app</code> to initialize the project and then trim our source code to the bare minimum.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Create the app</span>
npx create-react-app my-app <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> my-app</code></pre></div>
<p>At the time of writing, <code>create-react-app</code> produces these React dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"react"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-dom"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.0.1"</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a handful of source files under <code>src</code>, but our application will need just two of them: <code>index.js</code>, the entrypoint for Webpack, and <code>App.js</code>, the root component of our application. We can delete the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Delete all the source files except for the entrypoint and</span>
<span># root app component</span>
find src -type f -not <span>\(</span> -name <span>'index.js'</span> -or -name <span>'App.js'</span> <span>\)</span> -delete</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, let’s replace the contents of those two files with the bare minimum we’ll need for this article. From here on out I’ll supply diffs that you can supply to <code>git apply</code> to apply the same changes I did.</p>

<p>First, our entrypoint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>App</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App"</span><span>;</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>App</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our main app component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>My</span> <span>App</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>App</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="writing-a-react-component">Writing a React component</h3>

<p>Let’s write our first React component: a counter. This is likely the first example of a React component you ever encountered; it’s the first example in the PureScript React libraries as well. It’s also small and simple enough to be replaced twice over the course of this article.</p>

<p>The counter will be a button which maintains the number of times it has been clicked. It will accept, as its only prop, a label to display on the button.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/Counter.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>);</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>render</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>({</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>})}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span>
      <span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Counter</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we’ll import our new counters into our main application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,9 +1,13 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
<span>+import Counter from "./Counter";
</span><span></span>
 function App() {
   return (
     &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;
<span>+      &lt;Counter label="Count" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Clicks" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Interactions" /&gt;
</span><span></span>     &lt;/div&gt;
   );
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>yarn start</code> we can run the dev server and see our app in action.</p>

<p><img src="https://thomashoneyman.com/images/2019/running-app.gif" alt="running app"></p>



<p>We’ve written entirely too much JavaScript. Let’s support PureScript in this project as well. Our goal is to write code in either language and freely import in either direction without friction. To accomplish that, we will install PureScript tooling, create a separate PureScript source directory, and rely on the compiler to generate JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-compiler-and-package-manager">1. Install the compiler and package manager</h3>

<p>First we must install PureScript tooling. I recommend installing versions of the compiler and Spago (a package manager and build tool) which match those used in this article. I’ll use NPX to ensure all commands are run using local copies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Install the compiler and the Spago package manager however you prefer;</span>
<span># since we're already in a React project I'll use Yarn</span>
yarn add -D purescript@0.13.2 spago@0.8.4</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="2-initialize-the-project-and-package-set">2. Initialize the project and package set</h3>

<p>We can create a new PureScript project with <code>spago init</code>. As of version 0.8.4, Spago always initializes with the same package set, which means you should have identical package versions to those used to write this article. I’m using the <code>psc-0.13.0-20190607</code> package set.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># npx ensures we're using our local copy of Spago installed in node_modules.</span>
npx spago init</code></pre></div>
<p>Spago has created a <code>packages.dhall</code> file which points at the set of packages which can be installed and a <code>spago.dhall</code> file which lists the packages we’ve actually installed. We can now install any dependencies we need and we’ll know for sure the versions are all compatible.</p>

<p>Before installing anything, let’s update the existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to cover PureScript. For a Spago-based project this will work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>echo</span> -e <span>"\noutput\n.psc*\n.purs*\.spago"</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3-adjust-the-directory-structure">3. Adjust the directory structure</h3>

<p>Finally, let’s organize our source code. It’s typical to separate JavaScript source from PureScript source except when writing an FFI file for PureScript. Since we aren’t doing that in this project, our source files will be entirely separated. Let’s move all JavaScript code into a <code>javascript</code> subdirectory and create a new <code>purescript</code> folder next to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir src/javascript src/purescript
mv src/App.js src/Counter.js src/javascript</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we’ll adjust <code>index.js</code> to the new location of our root component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/index.js

<p>We’ve just one task left. The PureScript compiler generates JavaScript into a directory named <code>output</code> in the root of the project. But <code>create-react-app</code> disables importing anything outside the <code>src</code> directory. While there are fancier solutions, for this project we’ll get around the restriction by symlinking the <code>output</code> directory into the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># we can now import compiled PureScript from src/output/...</span>
ln -s <span>$PWD</span>/output <span>$PWD</span>/src</code></pre></div>
<p>Your <code>src</code> directory should now look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">src
├── index.js
├── javascript
│ ├── App.js
│ └── Counter.js
├── output -&gt; ../output
└── purescript</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="replacing-a-react-component-with-purescript-react">Replacing a React component with PureScript React</h2>

<p>I like to follow four simple steps when replacing a JavaScript React component with a PureScript one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the component in idiomatic PureScript.</li>
<li>Write a separate interop module for the component. This module provides the JavaScript interface and conversion functions between PureScript and JavaScript types and idioms.</li>
<li>Use the PureScript compiler to generate JavaScript</li>
<li>Import the resulting code as if it were a regular JavaScript React component.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll start with the <code>react</code> library, which we use at Awake Security. It’s similar to <code>react-basic</code> but maps more directly to the underlying React code and is less opinionated. Later, we’ll switch to <code>react-basic</code>, which will demonstrate some differences between them.</p>

<p>As we take each step in this process I’ll explain more about why it’s necessary and some best practices to keep in mind. Let’s start: install the <code>react</code> library and prepare to write our component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># install the purescript-react library</span>
npx spago install react

<span># build the project so editors can pick up the `output` directory</span>
npx spago build

<span># create the component source file</span>
touch src/purescript/Counter.purs</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="1-write-the-react-component-in-idiomatic-purescript">1. Write the React component in idiomatic PureScript</h3>

<p>Even though we are writing a component to be used from JavaScript, we should still write ordinary PureScript. As we’ll soon see, it’s possible to adjust only the interface of the component for JavaScript but leave the internals untouched. This is especially important if this component is meant to be used by both PureScript and …</p></div></div>

    <p>Life before a software engineering career is commonly a series of time-bound efforts to gain competency in a new area. This semester you learn geometry. That semester you learn history. Next semester you learn calculus. And so on.</p>

<p>As a result, most people entering the software engineering workforce equate learning with learning a brand new topic. I didn’t know ruby, I learned ruby. I didn’t know SQL, now I know SQL.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking leads people to 2 year cycles. On most modern software teams, it takes roughly one year to really feel like you have your feet under you. By that time the kind of learning novelty people are used to isn’t there. By 16 months they’re restless. By 24 months they’re gone.</p>

<p>This is a problem. It’s a problem because the majority of durable and transferable knowledge comes after achieving basic competency. Mastery of a skillset, understanding and learning from the outcomes of decisions made years ago, architecture and design, leading projects - these all come well after basic competency.</p>

<p>Not only does a life of cyclic learning work against reaching these next levels, but your ego and willpower also work against you. Those next-level skills are harder to learn. And once you’ve gained competency you lose the excuse of “I’m onboarding” or “still ramping up” when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I always challenge engineers that want to make big changes in what they’re working on to consider whether they’re simply at the end of a novelty cycle. I always encourage them to go after those next level skills.</p>

<p>On the hiring front, I see a lot of people who have a career’s worth of 2-year stints. You can do that successfully for an entire career, and there are even some people that’ll tell you it’s a way to optimize earnings over time. If it does, I believe it only optimizes earnings for people who can’t get to those next level skills. The biggest earnings come from building and growing with a winning company.</p>

<p>24-monthers never deeply learn how things work. They’ll typically add value to a new company by carrying a collection of things they’ve seen before and shallowly applying them to similar problems. But when faced with a new problem that doesn’t map easily to the solutions they’ve seen, things start to break down.</p>

<p>The end-games for both careers are very different.</p>

<p>24-monthers eventually can get into C-level positions where it’s not uncommon to bring in someone who can just apply the common solutions to the similar task at hand. Their stints usually end right around the time where they’ve upleveled the company in some way and don’t know how to grow their team or evolve their strategy or deal with the short-comings of some of their decisions.</p>

<p>People who learn next level skills and how to deeply understand and react to the tasks at hand lead companies to uniquely successful outcomes. The best CEOs, the best CTOs, the best C-level anything - their careers are often a small handful of long-duration roles where they didn’t apply rote practices but innovated and reacted to change and created novel solutions based on deep understanding.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m not saying you should stay with any given job. There are bad roles and bad bosses and everything in between. And skill diversification is important. But every job has problems. If you’re leaving because you’re chasing novelty or avoiding tackling your company’s challenges, you’ll start over in the cycle. Leave enough places for these reasons and you’ll find you’ve seriously limited your opportunities and earnings over time.</p>
