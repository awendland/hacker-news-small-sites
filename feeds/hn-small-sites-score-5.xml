                <p><strong>T</strong><span>here is no one in American government — or perhaps any government — quite like Dr. Anthony Fauci. His position, with its mixture of informal power and public visibility, scientific authority and beltway influence, is sui generis. Few other unconfirmed civil servants have access to as many rooms in the executive interagency; no public official commands as much respect in the world of science and medicine. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, he has advised six presidents (and now a seventh) on domestic and global health issues — HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and MERS — and overseen decades of research on infectious disease, pandemics, and virology. Under his stewardship, NIAID’s mission has been reshaped around his personage: its priorities are </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> priorities, its research agenda is </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> research agenda. And that agenda has borne fruit: breakthrough treatments for HIV and other deadly diseases and now, a vaccine for Covid-19. As Stanford microbiologist David Relman told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April, “Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although Fauci has no statutory authority to preside over a public health crisis, he has become the nation’s de facto Doctor-in-Chief during this pandemic. His face — elven and expressive — is the face of the medical establishment’s response to the novel coronavirus. I doubt most Americans can name the (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/20/biden-surgeon-general-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>outgoing</span></a><span>) U.S. Surgeon General, CDC Director, or Fauci’s nominal boss, the director of the National Institutes of Health (Jerome Adams, Robert Redfield, and Francis Collins, respectively), but everyone knows Dr. Fauci. His plaintive but never pessimistic patter and disarming outer-borough rasp are soothing sonic features of our daily dirge of death, doom, and statistics. I was relieved when I first saw Fauci on TV — sometime in March 2020 — thinking dimly to myself, for the millionth time, “Ah, an adult in the room.” Amid a ceaseless current of chaos and grief, Fauci’s egoless display of competence, his grandfatherly warmth and irony, were ports in a storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But a comforting bedside manner has done little to mitigate catastrophe. Over 400,000 Americans are dead, twice as many as any other country. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are currently at record highs. And although we have a vaccine, the rollout has already been stymied by a dearth of resources and coordination. As one public health expert told <em>The </em></span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>on January 17</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> our pandemic response has been “a colossal failure at every level of government.” And herein lies a paradox. America is suffering from a disease outbreak whose morbid scope is the consequence of world-historic negligence. We are desperately and needlessly sick. And yet, the man known as “America’s Doctor,” the undisputed personification of public health research and pandemic preparedness, faces no reputational consequences. On the contrary, Dr. Fauci remains one of our most beloved public figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What explains this? Liberals, who otherwise harshly condemn the federal government’s pandemic response, are especially besotted with the diminutive virologist. For fans of the #Resistance, a well-timed </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>facepalm</span></a><span> during one of the Mad King’s early soliloquies guaranteed Fauci’s place on a Mount Rushmore of replacement patriarchs, alongside James Comey and Robert Mueller. (Fauci later insisted the gesture was innocuous; he was merely obscuring his face to dislodge a lozenge from his throat.) Still, Democrats’ devotion has never waned. They see in Fauci a lonely champion of “truth” and “facts” in a White House otherwise hostile to “science.” Brad Pitt earned an Emmy nomination for portraying the 80-year-old physician on Saturday Night Live. One Hamilton-inspired TikTok (“My name is Dr. Anthony Fau-CHEE…”) went viral. Just since the beginning of the “third wave” of Covid infections in October, Fauci has received leadership awards from the National Academy of Medicine, the FBI Agents Association, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, and the Boy Scouts of America. Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/anthony-fauci-biden-transition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>asked</span></a><span> Fauci to stay on at NIAID and serve in his administration as a chief medical advisor. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed “Anthony S. Fauci Day” on December 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fauci’s celebrity, however, cannot obscure empirical reality. As America’s Doctor would surely agree, the numbers don’t lie: 2,824 Americans died of Covid-19 on Anthony S. Fauci Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anthony Fauci is no doubt a dedicated public servant, respected by his colleagues, beloved by many Americans. But the puzzle remains: why has the man most closely associated with the public health response to the pandemic entirely avoided accountability for its failure?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>irst, the most straightforward defense: it wasn’t his fault. He did the best he could, but Fauci’s better instincts were thwarted by Trump and his coterie of idiots. Of course, there’s truth in this. The uneasy peace between Trump and his medical advisors started to unravel almost before it began. By the end of March, Trump was sweating the stocks and tweeting that the “cure” must not be worse “than the problem itself.” He clashed with Fauci throughout the spring — over masks, hydroxychloroquine, school openings, and Easter. By summer, Trump was publicly lambasting the good doctor, leaking anti-Fauci talking points to the press and sidelining him in task force meetings, which were themselves increasingly rare. Scott Atlas, the libertarian radiologist and herd-immunity advocate whom Trump hired based on his Fox News appearances, was calling the shots.</span></p>
<p><span>But Fauci seldom contradicted the president’s lies outright, opting for tact and de-escalation instead. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a><span> in late March. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” On July 4, Trump said 99 percent of Covid cases were “harmless.” Fauci characterized this as a misinterpretation. (“I’m trying to figure out where the president got that number…” he said.) Though Fauci has a reputation for bluntness, as the </span><i><span>Financial Times</span></i><span>’s Hannah Kuchler </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>observed</span></a><span>, “he clearly also tries to hold back, believing he will make a bigger difference to the course of the pandemic if he keeps his job.”</span></p>
<p><span>This logic pervades the most common defense of Fauci’s record. “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation,” Nobel laureate biologist David Baltimore told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April. “That has been wonderful for our country and the world.” In this view, Fauci was </span><i><span>handling</span></i><span> Trump, just as he handled previous presidents, including a reluctant Ronald Reagan during the AIDS epidemic. When he pulls his punches, it’s always for the greater good; namely, the cause of remaining in the room. Stepping too far out of line, contradicting Trump with too much vigor, would have imperiled his standing. “The argument for Fauci saying more,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/anthony-fauci-built-truce-trump-is-destroying-it/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wrote</span></a><span> Molly Roberts in <em>The</em> </span><i><span>Washington Post</span></i><span>, “… is also an argument for self-exile.” And then what? Truth and facts would have had no advocate inside the White House. As Fauci himself </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> on Sunday, “I felt that if I stepped down, that would leave a void. Someone’s got to not be afraid to speak out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span>At a briefing in July, Trump </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-approval-rating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>mused</span></a><span>, “It’s interesting: [Fauci’s] got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good. Because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us.” Winding his way to his point, Trump said, “So why don’t I have a high approval rating… with respect to the virus?” After a pause, he deadpanned, “It can only be my personality, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is often the case with Trump, he had a point, just not the one he meant. The liberal apologia for Fauci </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> internally contradictory. As one scientist said to me, “We can’t deify Fauci’s response to the pandemic as fantastic while simultaneously condemning Trump, when for months, the two were hand in hand.” Indeed, Fauci is only blameless if he was utterly powerless to stop the administration’s disastrous plans. And if he </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> powerless, he should’ve resigned and communicated the truth bluntly to the public long ago. Otherwise, he knowingly lent credibility to an abject failure he couldn’t control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To put an even finer point on it, the precise conditions that would maximally exonerate Fauci — i.e., Trump is solely at fault; Fauci had no influence — are conditions under which Fauci </span><i><span>absolutely </span></i><span>should have bolted. The more aberrant Trump’s behavior, the more he diverged from the medically prudent course of action, the greater Fauci’s responsibility to leave and blow the whistle. If Fauci knew better but didn’t say, what use was he inside the room? If he </span><i><span>didn’t</span></i><span> know better, then he shares the blame.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In recent days, Fauci and Covid task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx — another veteran AIDS researcher who’s received slightly </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/biden-coronavirus-team-deborah-birx-437923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>less deferential</span></a><span> treatment from the media than her male counterpart — have undertaken a goodwill tour. Birx </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1353332977560735744?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS that denialists in the White House “derailed” the pandemic response, putting out information she knew to be false. Fauci joked with Rachel Maddow that Trump had </span><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/fauci-to-maddow-i-ve-been-wanting-to-come-on-your-show-for-months-and-months-99905093921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>forbidden</span></a><span>&nbsp;him from coming on her show and </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/21/anthony-fauci-speaking-covid-liberating-under-biden-vs-trump/4244169001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the White House press corps, “The idea that you can get up here and… let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.” Meanwhile, liberal pundits like Ezra Klein have </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/biden-covid-19-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>praised</span></a><span> Biden’s “maddeningly obvious” Covid plans, describing their simplicity as a “damning indictment” of Trump’s negligence. But if Biden’s life-saving interventions are so straightforward and crucial, why weren’t Fauci and Birx loudly demanding them months ago?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To keep their jobs” should not be a satisfying answer — not for the living or for the dead.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="content">
<p>Recently I have become curious about <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the Gemini
Project</a> and the content that people have
made available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced
by the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I
typically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on
people’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But
presumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that
it’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace
conducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m
remaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate
protocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t
work and I had to spend time writing
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/gmi2email">gmi2email</a>.</p>

<p>I now have a games console at home for the first time in some years, which I
bought in response to the ongoing pandemic, and one thing that I have noticed
is that using it feels like being offline in a way that playing games on a
regular computer never would.  It has a WiFi connection but it doesn’t have a
web browser, and I am glad that using it provides an opportunity to be
disconnected from the usual streams of information.  And perhaps something
similar ought to be said in favour of how the Gemini project does not just use
http.  There is, perhaps, a positive psychological effect induced by making
the boundary between text/gemini and the web as hard as it is made by using
gemini:// rather than http.</p>

<p>Something about which I find myself much more sceptical is how the
specification for gemini:// and text/gemini is not extensible.  Advocates of
Gemini have this idea that they can’t include, say, a version number in the
protocol, because the extensibility of the web is what has led to the problems
they think it has, so they want to make it impossible.  Now on the one hand
perhaps the people behind Gemini are in the best position that anyone is in to
come up with a spec which they will finalise and render effectively
unchangeable, because a lot of them have been using Gopher for decades, and so
they have enough experience to be able to say exactly what Gopher is missing,
and be confident that they’ve not missed anything.  But on the other hand,
Gemini is one technological piece in attempts to make a version of the
Internet which is healthier for humans – the so-called “small Internet”
movement – and maybe there will be new ideas about how the small Internet
should be which would benefit from a new version of the Gemini specification.
So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.</p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.

<p>In a previous <a href="https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html">post</a> I have explained my motivations for functional programming.
It’s no secret I love F# because F# makes me sleep better. In this post, I would like to discuss some different aspects of F#.</p>

<h2 id="f-is-gaining-independence-from-net">F# is gaining independence from .NET</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/platform.png" alt="F# platforms"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>F# is mostly known to the developer community as the small ignored brother of C# running on the .NET platform. However, what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a level to be .NET independent. Thanks to <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes,
people do write full-blown SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. If you think Fable is just a transpiler, think again:  https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable . I would say Fable is on the way being an ecosystem by itself.</p>

<p>There is also a new prototype target for Fable that allows F# code to transpile to Python developed by Dag Brattli.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/python2.gif" alt="Python"></p>

<p>F# also works as on WebAssembly with <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a> which is still based on .NET. And not to forget another F# web platform called <a href="https://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> from the same people who developed Bolero.</p>

<p>Just like JavaScript people were using NodeJs to bring the front-end devs to the backend zone, F# also can be used to bring the backend-devs to the front-end realm. I am a living example myself. By using F# in the font-end you can practically share the code between your .NET/Node backend and the browser, giving you an isomorphic development experience.</p>

<p>This somewhat puts F# in an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.</p>

<h2 id="the-f-fanboys">The F# fanboys</h2>

<p>You might have heard “one of those guys” like me who is talking about how great functional programming and/or F# is. And from that point, it looks like below</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/music.png" alt="music"></p>

<p>I know it’s annoying, however, let’s look at it from the side and this is how an F# developer feels when he or she is suggesting you using F#:
<img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/wheel.png" alt="wheels"></p>

<h2 id="microsofts-and-communitys-stance">Microsoft’s and community’s stance</h2>

<p>From Microsoft’s point of view, F# is actively supported and maintained. There are Microsoft developers actively fixing things and adding new features however as a general Microsoft’s point of view .NET == C# and that is that. From .NET developer community’s
point of view, things are even worse. Since all Microsoft docs and tools geared towards C#, adding up unfamiliarity with the functional paradigm, most people follow C# way and completely ignore its little brother F#. I still think this is a missed 
opportunity for the .NET community. For example, let’s look at the excellent server side F# web framework <a href="https://giraffe.wiki/">Giraffe</a>. 
While C# and asp.net developers are busy memorizing the Microsoft way of handling requests, learning what attributes to decorate their
classes and members, the F# developers who use giraffe, simply rely on functional composition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>route</span> <span>"/"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setHttpHeader</span> <span>"X-Foo"</span> <span>"Bar"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setStatusCode</span> <span>200</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setBodyFromString</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As HTTP processing is usually treated as a pipeline by itself on the server-side, it’s an excellent target for functional programming. Just like lego, plug-in your pipes, and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most developers worry about if they could find an F# job whereas companies who consider making the switch worry if they could find an F# developer.
As of today on linked in there are approximately 700 F# jobs and even most of these are not F# specific rather than they are like “C# or F# developers wanted”.</p>

<p>And most non-.NET people are not willing to touch anything related to Microsoft even with a 10 foot pole. (Of course, the major exceptions to this are TypeScript and Visual Studio Code which both are widely popular). The  Functional programmers’ camp also dismisses F# at sight blaming it’s not like Haskell as in for example F# does not support type classes.</p>

<h2 id="couple-of-unique-features-of-f">Couple of unique features of F#</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about the features of F# but just wanted to highlight a couple of them.</p>

<p>The first one is the file order. Please look at the below photo:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/files.png" alt="file-order"></p>

<p>In F# the order of the files matter. It is somewhat a disliked feature by the newcomers, but it makes the dependencies immediately visible.
So the code in the top file has no dependency on any others below and the 2nd file from the top only depends on the first. When you open a project which you are not 
familiar, file ordering helps to find your way.</p>

<p>The second one is Type Providers:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/sqlprovider.gif" alt="type-providers"></p>

<p>Type providers are somewhat code generators but they do that non-intrusively. Very roughly similar to LISP style macros they expand at compile time. Type providers make it very easy to discover HTML or JSON documents read database rows, file system, and discover DDL and rows within the coding screen without leaving your editor. And everything becomes so type-safe.</p>

<h2 id="develop-fantastic-ui-apps-with-f-and-elmish">Develop fantastic UI apps with F# and Elmish</h2>

<p>Well they say seeing is believing, so let’s see how well F# handles UI development. While React devs on Facebook trying to solve the state problem over and over again by using hooks and perhaps new experimental
recoil and contexts IMHO, all are horrible options as they encourage rendering code inter-mix with business code reminding me asp.net web forms times where you could write your SQL statements right into the page itself.</p>

<p>F# developers have ported elm architecture to something called elmish and it flourished well among F# community.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of things you can do with Elmish as you can write your business code once and port it to any UI platform below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/react">Elmish React</a></li>
  <li>Windows Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish WPF</a></li>
  <li>Gaming: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Xelmish">Xelmish</a></li>
  <li>Cross platform UI: <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI">Avalonia.FuncUI</a></li>
  <li>Mobile development: <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a></li>
  <li>Terminal: <a href="https://github.com/DieselMeister/Terminal.Gui.Elmish">Terminal.Gui.Elmish</a></li>
  <li>Web Assembly: <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same single architecture: Elmish. So you can write your code for one and port it to another.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-some-resources">Getting started and some resources</h2>

<p>If you want to get started to F#, the first place you should check out is <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F# Software Foundation</a></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/fsf2.png" alt="fsharp-foundation"></p>

<p>As you can see FSharp Software Foundation offers mentorship programs periodically, which means you can have a free weekly 1 on 1 session with an experienced F# developer! As of today the program is open for people who want to have an F# mentor or want to be
an F# mentor. You can apply from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKgZaAcjf7ZxVqBZzyZcBi609BOc0etBnV5XhR6BMihdyYRw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sold with F# there is one important point to highlight. Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar
with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm. F# is a functional-first programming language. In other words,
although F# has OOP syntax as well, it mostly makes sense to use F# when you want to get benefit from functional programming concepts. If you try to program
F# the same way you program other imperative languages you won’t get much benefit.</p>

<p>If you are a C# develeoper and you want to start functional programming with F# this is the go-to book:
<em>Disclaimer: I do not know the author nor I am affiliated with the publisher by any way</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp">Functional programming in C#</a></p>

<p>Although the book is mostly about C#, it will show you how painful to do functional programming with C# and only perhaps then you can develop
some love for F#. Having that said it will also help you to understand some more new coming but confusing features of C# 9 like Records and Pattern matching.
If you think  C# records are for immutability, no they are not. They are for Value semantics and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#:~:text=In%20functional%20programming%2C%20referential%20transparency,the%20result%20of%20the%20program.">referential transparency</a>.</p>

<p>To try F# right away you may use the following links:</p>

<p>https://try.fsharp.org/</p>

<p>https://fable.io/repl/</p>

<p>https://tryfsharp.fsbolero.io/</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>When you are unfamiliar with F# syntax, it might look a bit cryptic. And I have seen some people complained that it is very verbose. On the contrary, I would make a bold claim that F# beats most other languages when it comes to conciseness. You don’t believe me? see it your self (make sure you check all implementations)</p>

<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:F_Sharp">F# problems on Rosetta Code</a></p>

<h2 id="a-couple-of-toy-projects-of-mine">A couple of toy projects of mine</h2>

<p>I have developed commercial applications with F#, but as public stuff here are a couple of projects I have built. One is a full blazor/web assembly project:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/FBlazorShop</p>

<p>And the actual app for the 3D bin packing problem, in which items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/BinDrake</p>

<p>http://bindrake.com/</p>

<p>Trying and learning F# really requires you to dismiss your prejudices and be patient. But in the end, once you master the functional paradigm,
it makes you sleep better as a developer.</p>

<p>Hey, folks. Sorry it's been a while, but it's been a busy time. Let's start with the bad news first.</p>

<h2>Bad news</h2>

<p>As you know, SuperDuper 3.3.1 cannot copy a volume with Big Sur on it. We're currently blocked on some issues I don't have direct control over, and as such I don't have a new version for you that <strong>fully</strong> supports Big Sur, nor a timeframe for when that will be released.</p>

<p>Right now, as many of you know, v3.3.1 <strong>will</strong> work with non-boot volumes, but it <strong>won't</strong> work with volumes that have macOS on them, because it will try to do some of the things that no longer work in macOS 11.</p>

<p>I know that's been a disappointment, but that's where we are with v3.3.1.</p>

<h2>Good news!</h2>

<p>However, after wracking my brain for <strong>far</strong> too long, I've come up with a <strong>workaround</strong> that will let you make the backups you need to save your files, and to supplement your Time Machine backup. And for that, we need to go Back...to the Future!</p>

<h2>Huh?</h2>

<p>Let me try to explain.</p>

<p>In Catalina, as I explain in <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/breaking_the_tape/">Breaking the Tape</a>, Apple split the startup volume into two parts: the System volume and the Data volume. We did a ton of work that year to support this new setup in a way that was transparent to the user; SuperDuper automatically creates the proper volumes, converts the drives to APFS as needed, etc.</p>

<p>Worked great.</p>

<p>In macOS 10.15.5, though, <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/black_boxes_and_bugs/">Apple broke 3rd party copy tools</a> in a way that couldn't be worked around without the use of <code>asr</code>, a low-level drive copy tool that has its own issues. They fixed that in 10.15.6...but it was a rather ominous sign for the future.</p>

<p>That ominous sign became terrifying reality in macOS 11. Due to the new Sealed System Volume, use of <code>asr</code> became mandatory if you wanted to make a copy that was bootable. And even <strong>that</strong> didn't work <strong>at all</strong> until <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/big_sur/">November 5th</a> of last year—just before Big Sur's official release.</p>

<p>Even now, as of the time of this writing, <code>asr</code> won't make a bootable copy of an M1-based Mac.</p>

<p>So, as of Big Sur, 3rd party tools like SuperDuper can no longer make bootable copies on their own. For that, it's <code>asr</code> or nothing.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/">a <em>very</em> <strong>sweet solution</strong></a>.</p>

<p>But, 3.3.1 doesn't know that. It tries to do all the special stuff that we had to do for Catalina, and those things no longer work. And so, as you've seen, that copy generates errors or seems to hang right at the start (because it's thrown exceptions that stop the copy).</p>

<h2>Didn't You Say "Good News"?</h2>

<p>I'm getting there.</p>

<p>SuperDuper! 3.3.1's magic was all about dealing with the split startup volume. It built on the APFS support and scheduling fixes we put into the previous version...and added new things for compatibility with Catalina.</p>

<p>But...what if it <strong>didn't</strong> do that? What if SuperDuper was...<strong>stupider</strong>?</p>

<h2>Wonderfully Awful</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oUUdW2bTa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I've been testing this out for a while in-house. and I've come up with a weird-sounding workaround that...works!</p>

<p>Basically, you can use SuperDuper to copy the Data volume of the volume group. The result contains all <strong>your</strong> data and applications, can be restored in a few different ways...and can even be made bootable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that, as I indicated above, M1 Macs <strong>can't readily boot from external drives</strong>. There are things you can do, if you have an external Thunderbolt 3 drive (USB-C isn't sufficient), but even that won't work if the internal drive is dead. Unless things change, bootable backups are basically a thing of the past on M1-based Macs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>It's actually easy. To accomplish this, use an old version of SuperDuper—<a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">specifically, v3.2.5</a>—to copy the Data volume, which is shown in the older version!</p>

<p>v3.2.5 is well tested, having been on the market for quite some time, and is reliable. So we don't have to worry about doing a broad beta test of a partially complete new release. It's already tested, and I've been busy doing the additional testing necessary to prove it works on Big Sur.</p>

<p>Again, this will make a copy of the data that you need to preserve <strong>your</strong> stuff, both Applications and Data, while leaving the Sealed System Volume alone.</p>

<p>And it's a valid source for "restore" during a clean install or migration! So restoration is <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>fast</strong> should it become necessary.</p>

<h2>Neat!</h2>

<p>Yeah, I wish I had thought of this earlier.</p>

<p>So, if you're on Big Sur, and you want to copy a startup drive, here's what to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have your license information handy. You can retrieve it from SuperDuper's Register... page should you need to.</li>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/downloads/SuperDuper!+3.2.5.dmg">SuperDuper! v3.2.5 from here</a>.</li>
<li>Remove SuperDuper! from the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane and restart your Mac. This is important, and works around an Apple bug triggered by the change of SuperDuper!'s bundle ID.</li>
<li>Run SuperDuper and follow the steps to add it back into Security &amp; Privacy.</li>
<li>If your license is missing, re-enter it from your license email. </li>
<li>Turn off "Check for Updates" in our Preferences so we don't nag you about v3.3.1.</li>
<li>Select the "Data" volume in the source pop-up, and a <strong>new</strong> APFS backup volume in the destination pop-up, along with "Backup - all files" (or whatever script you want).
&gt; If you already have a backup volume, you can use Disk Utility to delete <strong>just</strong> the System volume, rather than create a new one. After doing this, you may need to repair it with Disk First Aid before it will show up in SuperDuper.</li>
<li>Make your copy as normal, set up your schedule as needed, etc. Your regular Smart Updates will work as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>To fully restore, it's easiest to boot to recovery, erase the internal drive you want to restore to, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904">reinstall the OS from Recovery mode</a>, and then, when prompted to restore during the first boot of the fresh copy of macOS, point at the backup. All your data and applications will be brought in automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to make the backup bootable and have an Intel Mac, boot to Recovery (Cmd+R during power on) and install Big Sur to the backup drive. You can then start up from the backup. Note, though, that once made bootable, you can no longer copy <strong>to</strong> the backup until you delete the system volume as above. So <strong>don't</strong> do this unless you need to.</p>

<h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>

<p>It seems clear that the future of bootable backups is unclear.</p>

<p>M1 Macs <strong>can't</strong> be copied in a way that makes them bootable. Bare metal recovery on an M1 Mac isn't possible, since they depend on the contents of their internal drive even when booting externally. And the tools required to make bootable copies of Intel Macs are limited, often fail, and produce inscrutable and undocumented diagnostics when they do.</p>

<p>Everything's a tradeoff, and with the M1 Macs, Apple has given us an amazing new platform, while taking away some of the things that made macOS such a joy to work with. And one of those things is bootable backups.</p>

<p>I have <strong>no idea</strong> if this is going to change for the better in whatever the next macOS version brings, and have no insight into Apple's future plans.</p>

<p>But I <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">continue to advise multiple backup strategies</a>, including Time Machine (to an APFS volume under Big Sur), SuperDuper! (for a simple copy of your data and applications) and an online backup program (as a last resort).</p>

<p>With that, back to plugging away at a new version.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and for using SuperDuper.</p>

                <p><strong>T</strong><span>here is no one in American government — or perhaps any government — quite like Dr. Anthony Fauci. His position, with its mixture of informal power and public visibility, scientific authority and beltway influence, is sui generis. Few other unconfirmed civil servants have access to as many rooms in the executive interagency; no public official commands as much respect in the world of science and medicine. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, he has advised six presidents (and now a seventh) on domestic and global health issues — HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, Zika, and MERS — and overseen decades of research on infectious disease, pandemics, and virology. Under his stewardship, NIAID’s mission has been reshaped around his personage: its priorities are </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> priorities, its research agenda is </span><i><span>his</span></i><span> research agenda. And that agenda has borne fruit: breakthrough treatments for HIV and other deadly diseases and now, a vaccine for Covid-19. As Stanford microbiologist David Relman told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April, “Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although Fauci has no statutory authority to preside over a public health crisis, he has become the nation’s de facto Doctor-in-Chief during this pandemic. His face — elven and expressive — is the face of the medical establishment’s response to the novel coronavirus. I doubt most Americans can name the (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/20/biden-surgeon-general-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>outgoing</span></a><span>) U.S. Surgeon General, CDC Director, or Fauci’s nominal boss, the director of the National Institutes of Health (Jerome Adams, Robert Redfield, and Francis Collins, respectively), but everyone knows Dr. Fauci. His plaintive but never pessimistic patter and disarming outer-borough rasp are soothing sonic features of our daily dirge of death, doom, and statistics. I was relieved when I first saw Fauci on TV — sometime in March 2020 — thinking dimly to myself, for the millionth time, “Ah, an adult in the room.” Amid a ceaseless current of chaos and grief, Fauci’s egoless display of competence, his grandfatherly warmth and irony, were ports in a storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But a comforting bedside manner has done little to mitigate catastrophe. Over 400,000 Americans are dead, twice as many as any other country. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are currently at record highs. And although we have a vaccine, the rollout has already been stymied by a dearth of resources and coordination. As one public health expert told <em>The </em></span><i><span>New York Times </span></i><span>on January 17</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> our pandemic response has been “a colossal failure at every level of government.” And herein lies a paradox. America is suffering from a disease outbreak whose morbid scope is the consequence of world-historic negligence. We are desperately and needlessly sick. And yet, the man known as “America’s Doctor,” the undisputed personification of public health research and pandemic preparedness, faces no reputational consequences. On the contrary, Dr. Fauci remains one of our most beloved public figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What explains this? Liberals, who otherwise harshly condemn the federal government’s pandemic response, are especially besotted with the diminutive virologist. For fans of the #Resistance, a well-timed </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>facepalm</span></a><span> during one of the Mad King’s early soliloquies guaranteed Fauci’s place on a Mount Rushmore of replacement patriarchs, alongside James Comey and Robert Mueller. (Fauci later insisted the gesture was innocuous; he was merely obscuring his face to dislodge a lozenge from his throat.) Still, Democrats’ devotion has never waned. They see in Fauci a lonely champion of “truth” and “facts” in a White House otherwise hostile to “science.” Brad Pitt earned an Emmy nomination for portraying the 80-year-old physician on Saturday Night Live. One Hamilton-inspired TikTok (“My name is Dr. Anthony Fau-CHEE…”) went viral. Just since the beginning of the “third wave” of Covid infections in October, Fauci has received leadership awards from the National Academy of Medicine, the FBI Agents Association, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, and the Boy Scouts of America. Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/politics/anthony-fauci-biden-transition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>asked</span></a><span> Fauci to stay on at NIAID and serve in his administration as a chief medical advisor. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed “Anthony S. Fauci Day” on December 24.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fauci’s celebrity, however, cannot obscure empirical reality. As America’s Doctor would surely agree, the numbers don’t lie: 2,824 Americans died of Covid-19 on Anthony S. Fauci Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anthony Fauci is no doubt a dedicated public servant, respected by his colleagues, beloved by many Americans. But the puzzle remains: why has the man most closely associated with the public health response to the pandemic entirely avoided accountability for its failure?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>irst, the most straightforward defense: it wasn’t his fault. He did the best he could, but Fauci’s better instincts were thwarted by Trump and his coterie of idiots. Of course, there’s truth in this. The uneasy peace between Trump and his medical advisors started to unravel almost before it began. By the end of March, Trump was sweating the stocks and tweeting that the “cure” must not be worse “than the problem itself.” He clashed with Fauci throughout the spring — over masks, hydroxychloroquine, school openings, and Easter. By summer, Trump was publicly lambasting the good doctor, leaking anti-Fauci talking points to the press and sidelining him in task force meetings, which were themselves increasingly rare. Scott Atlas, the libertarian radiologist and herd-immunity advocate whom Trump hired based on his Fox News appearances, was calling the shots.</span></p>
<p><span>But Fauci seldom contradicted the president’s lies outright, opting for tact and de-escalation instead. “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/dr-fauci-press-conference-white-house-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>said</span></a><span> in late March. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.” On July 4, Trump said 99 percent of Covid cases were “harmless.” Fauci characterized this as a misinterpretation. (“I’m trying to figure out where the president got that number…” he said.) Though Fauci has a reputation for bluntness, as the </span><i><span>Financial Times</span></i><span>’s Hannah Kuchler </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>observed</span></a><span>, “he clearly also tries to hold back, believing he will make a bigger difference to the course of the pandemic if he keeps his job.”</span></p>
<p><span>This logic pervades the most common defense of Fauci’s record. “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation,” Nobel laureate biologist David Baltimore told </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>New Yorker</span></i><span> in April. “That has been wonderful for our country and the world.” In this view, Fauci was </span><i><span>handling</span></i><span> Trump, just as he handled previous presidents, including a reluctant Ronald Reagan during the AIDS epidemic. When he pulls his punches, it’s always for the greater good; namely, the cause of remaining in the room. Stepping too far out of line, contradicting Trump with too much vigor, would have imperiled his standing. “The argument for Fauci saying more,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/anthony-fauci-built-truce-trump-is-destroying-it/?arc404=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>wrote</span></a><span> Molly Roberts in <em>The</em> </span><i><span>Washington Post</span></i><span>, “… is also an argument for self-exile.” And then what? Truth and facts would have had no advocate inside the White House. As Fauci himself </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> on Sunday, “I felt that if I stepped down, that would leave a void. Someone’s got to not be afraid to speak out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span>At a briefing in July, Trump </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/politics/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-approval-rating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>mused</span></a><span>, “It’s interesting: [Fauci’s] got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it’s good. Because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us.” Winding his way to his point, Trump said, “So why don’t I have a high approval rating… with respect to the virus?” After a pause, he deadpanned, “It can only be my personality, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is often the case with Trump, he had a point, just not the one he meant. The liberal apologia for Fauci </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> internally contradictory. As one scientist said to me, “We can’t deify Fauci’s response to the pandemic as fantastic while simultaneously condemning Trump, when for months, the two were hand in hand.” Indeed, Fauci is only blameless if he was utterly powerless to stop the administration’s disastrous plans. And if he </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> powerless, he should’ve resigned and communicated the truth bluntly to the public long ago. Otherwise, he knowingly lent credibility to an abject failure he couldn’t control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To put an even finer point on it, the precise conditions that would maximally exonerate Fauci — i.e., Trump is solely at fault; Fauci had no influence — are conditions under which Fauci </span><i><span>absolutely </span></i><span>should have bolted. The more aberrant Trump’s behavior, the more he diverged from the medically prudent course of action, the greater Fauci’s responsibility to leave and blow the whistle. If Fauci knew better but didn’t say, what use was he inside the room? If he </span><i><span>didn’t</span></i><span> know better, then he shares the blame.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In recent days, Fauci and Covid task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx — another veteran AIDS researcher who’s received slightly </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/biden-coronavirus-team-deborah-birx-437923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>less deferential</span></a><span> treatment from the media than her male counterpart — have undertaken a goodwill tour. Birx </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1353332977560735744?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS that denialists in the White House “derailed” the pandemic response, putting out information she knew to be false. Fauci joked with Rachel Maddow that Trump had </span><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/fauci-to-maddow-i-ve-been-wanting-to-come-on-your-show-for-months-and-months-99905093921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>forbidden</span></a><span>&nbsp;him from coming on her show and </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/21/anthony-fauci-speaking-covid-liberating-under-biden-vs-trump/4244169001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>told</span></a><span> the White House press corps, “The idea that you can get up here and… let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.” Meanwhile, liberal pundits like Ezra Klein have </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/opinion/biden-covid-19-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>praised</span></a><span> Biden’s “maddeningly obvious” Covid plans, describing their simplicity as a “damning indictment” of Trump’s negligence. But if Biden’s life-saving interventions are so straightforward and crucial, why weren’t Fauci and Birx loudly demanding them months ago?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To keep their jobs” should not be a satisfying answer — not for the living or for the dead.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>F</strong><span>rank assessments of Fauci’s performance are hard to come by. Those in a position to judge him from an informed public …</span></p></div></div>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

<h3><time datetime="2020-01-31T21:00:00-00:00">January 31, 2020</time></h3>
</header>
</p><div><p>Some months ago, I got curious about ESP32 microcontrollers. The exact reason is not important. I ended up learning about <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/">NodeMCU</a>, <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>, <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/">I<sup>2</sup>C</a>. In the end, I was able to wire up an ESP32 to an OLED screen which showed a small set of rotating fortune cookies.</p>
<p>It turned out to be rather straightforward. I wanted more artificial constraints. After all, I am not doing this for real work. It’s just a different way of having a well defined task that can be accomplished in a short amount of time with a visible outcome. In that sense, it is similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/100754/sinan-%c3%9cn%c3%bcr">answering questions on Stackoverlow</a>. I find it helpful in a way others might find meditation helpful.</p>
<p>Before going further, I am know I late to the party. People have been doing this stuf for quite some time now. This gives me the ability to more easily discover how to solve a given problem because others did and wrote blog posts about them years ago.</p>
<p>My search for a <em>reasonably</em> constrained environment led me to <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85" title="ATtiny85 datasheet">ATtiny85</a>. I decided I wanted to do something with it, but I did not know what. So, the first thing I tried was to wire up an ATtiny85 to an OLED screen and display a (now much smaller) set of rotating <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2020/12/small-is-beautiful.html">fortune cookies</a>.</p>
<p>ATtiny85 has 8 kilobytes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">programmable flash</a>, 512 bytes of programmable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM">EEPROM</a>, and 512 bytes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory">SRAM</a>. As I said, for a while I did not know what I wanted to do with it. I would occasionally browse Amazon and order things that looked cheap and fun.</p>
<p><em>Note that in what follows, I will be using shortened Amazon affiliate links to the products I actually bought and used in making this blog post. The advantage of shortened links is that just loading the page does not immediately result in tracking images and cookies to be fetched (of course, if your browser does aggressive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ">link prefetching</a>, all bets are off). Linking to those products do not mean I endorse them or even recommend them. I am just writing about my experience using them.</em></p>
<p>Among the things I bought because it looked cheap at the time was <a title="Amazon afiliate link to Liyafy HC-35 product page" href="https://amzn.to/3raaH4b">Liyafy HC-35 8 LED 4x4 push button matrix keyboard</a>. From my perspective, it looked appealing because it came with no documentation, there were no useful comments or Q&amp;A on the product page, and a Google search only revealed <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=500018.0">an unanswered question from 2017 on the Arduino forums</a>.</p>
<p>In the package were two keypads on a single board with a slight perforation running through the middle. So, I cracked them apart :-) Now, I had two keypads with no documentation. Here is one of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/liyafy-hc-35-lg.jpg"><img src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/liyafy-hc-35-sm.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Documentation or not, the task seemed simple to me: There are three banks of pins on the left side of the board. The bottom bank is for manipulating the LEDs, and the two banks above that are for reading the state of the red buttons and the state of the black buttons, respectively. Eight LEDs, eight bits in a byte, not a huge leap to assume that each LED maps to a bit in a byte. It is not really clear whether the LEDs are ordered MSB first or LSB first. I am not good at reading board traces.</p>
<p>So, we need to have eight wires to drive the LEDs. VCC is clearly marked, but I didn’t know whether the board needed 5V or 3.3V. In fact, at first I guessed wrong and tried 5V. It doesn’t seem to have harmed the board, but after the fact, I thought maybe it would have been better to try the lower voltage first :-)</p>
<p>The ATtiny85 has 8 pins in <em>total</em>. We need a further four wires to read the state of the KEY B bank consisting of the red buttons, and we need an additional eight wires to read state of the KEY A bank consisting of the 4x4 keypad. Note the pins on the KEY A bank are labeled <var>L<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>R<sub>i</sub></var> where I would expect L to stand for “line” and R to stand for “row” which seem like the same thing to me. I decided to anchor on “R is row” and “L is column” as a working assumption, and focus solely on getting some lights to blink first.</p>
<p>Before going further, I should note that by the time I got around the thinking about this, a couple of months had gone by. Luckily, I had picked some other bits and pieces I thought might come in handy if I ever got around to trying this. Here is a list of what I ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NNFi97" title="Amazon affiliate link to ATtiny85 10 pack">A ten-pack of ATtiny85 chips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NNF1TD" title="Amazon affiliate link to Belker 45W/3A AC/DC adapter">Belker 45W 5V 6V 7.5V 9V 12V 13.5V 15V Universal AC DC Power Supply</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3r5mXmo" title="Amazon affiliate link to Tiny AVR Programmer">Tiny AVR programmer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that stuff you find on Amazon tends to have a markup compared to the unit prices you find when shopping at speciality or overseas suppliers. And, prices on Amazon tend to vary a lot. I was not in a rush, did not have a specific project in mind, and just grabbed a thing or two when I thought the price was right. The Belker adapter is great. I have, of course, a box of wall warts accumulated over time, but with those either the specs turn out not to be what you want (if you can read them) or the tips don’t match etc. Since I bought this, it’s already been useful in multiple other contexts.</p>
<p>Well, I figured the first task was to actually be able to get something on the ATtiny85 to execute. I knew that I needed to install some drivers for the “programmer”, stick the chip in the right way (here’s where the 10-pack comes in handy: If you insert the chip in the wrong way, it burns because you end up swapping VCC and GND and 5V runs through going the wrong way … don’t trust your eyes, triple check before plugging the programmer in to your computer’s USB port). The <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85" title="ATtiny85 datasheet">datasheet</a> has the pin out diagram as well as other good information:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-8pin-dip.png"><img title="ATtiny85 8 pin DIP package pinout diagram" alt="[ ATtiny85 8 pin DIP package pinout diagram ]" src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-8pin-dip-thumb.png"></a></p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tiny-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/all">SparkFun’s Tiny AVR programming hookup guide</a> followed by <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/01/drawing-on-an-oled-with-an-attiny85-no-ram-buffers-allowed/">Drawing On An OLED With An ATtiny85</a> to produce some output on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3aiv5JA" title="Amazon affilliate link to SSD1306 128x32 OLED 3-pack">128x32 OLED screen</a> to get warmed up.</p>
<p>The next task was to figure out how to drive the LEDs which require 8 wires using the five pins I had at my disposal. So, I started by staring at the contents of the “Fun Kit”. There are only two ICs included in the pack. I did not know what the 4N35 was for (it turned out to be a <a href="https://www.vishay.com/docs/81181/4n35.pdf">light sensor</a>) but it has only six pins, so clearly it could not do anything with mapping one bit at a time (aka serial) output to eight bits at a time (parallel). So, I searched the web for the only other IC in the package, <a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/sipo">74HC595</a>. TI’s page for the product mentions “<a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/ti-595-snip.png">8-bit shift registers with 3-state output registers</a>” right under the product name. To be honest, that didn’t mean any thing to me and I almost navigated away from the page, but scrolling down a little (is it me, or is everything on the web in huge and huger fonts now?) revealed the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SNx4HC595 devices contain an 8-bit, serial-in, parallel-out shift register that feeds an 8-bit D-type storage register. The storage register has parallel 3-state outputs. Separate clocks are provided for both the shift and storage register. The shift register has a direct overriding clear (SRCLR) input, serial (SER) input, and serial outputs for cascading. When the output-enable (OE) input is high, the outputs are in the high-impedance state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! It looks like the “fun kit” includes just the part I needed for this! Good.</p>
<p>Time to learn what the gobbledygook means … It sounds like it’s saying it takes serial input, puts bits in eight bins, and, when you give it the all clear, it puts those zeros and ones on some IO pins. Here is the pin-out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/SN74HC595-pins.png"><img alt="[ SN74HC595 pin out diagram ]" width="326" src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/SN74HC595-pins.png"></a></p>
<p><var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> - <var>Q<sub>H</sub></var> are the eight output pins. VCC is VCC, GND is GND. <u>SER</u> better be serial. O̅E̅ is “output enable” meaning put “put the bits you buffered on the pins”. <var>Q<sub>H</sub><sup>′</sup></var> seems to provide the same output serially.</p>
<p>OK, so I need to connect <var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> - <var>Q<sub>H</sub></var> to the LED inputs … I think I did this the “wrong” way by connecting <var>Q<sub>A</sub></var> to <var>D<sub>1</sub> on the keypad, but at this stage, I didn’t care what lit up … just that something did.</var></p>
<p>The big question is what to do with the five other pins. How do I drive them from the ATtiny85? I was confronted with a choice: I could read the datasheet, draw on my “vast” knowledge from electronics all gained in 8th grade, and translate the information in the datasheet to a program. Or, I could see if anyone else had done something similar. Searching for 74HC595 and Arduino led me to the documentation for the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/advanced-io/shiftout/">shiftout</a> function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shifts out a byte of data one bit at a time. Starts from either the most (i.e. the leftmost) or least (rightmost) significant bit. Each bit is written in turn to a data pin, after which a clock pin is pulsed (taken high, then low) to indicate that the bit is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice. It turns out Arduino documentation is really good like Perl documentation (docs on both focus on giving you the information you need to be able to use a specific piece of functionality – For a contrast, see Python’s documentation which tends to obscure the information you need in dense prose). The docs for <code>shiftout</code> came with a complete example as well as a link to a <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations/ShiftOut" title="Serial to Parallel Shifting-Out with a 74HC595">tutorial on controlling the 74HC595 shift register</a>. Of course, the mnemonics used in the pin-out diagram in the tutorial do not fully match the datasheet, but it is really nice to have these resources when you are trying to take the baby steps. It is easier to understand how you ended up blinking those if you can get them to blink in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, the tutorial is great. Explains all you need to know really. It is geared towards an Arduino board and those tend to have way more available pins than the ATtiny85. Laying cable on a breadboard is not my strong suit (never touched a soldering iron either), but after spending a moment considering my options, I decided to use the three available pins on the right side of the ATtiny85 (<var>PB<sub>0</sub></var> … <var>PB<sub>2</sub></var>) for interfacing with the 595. While reading the tutorial, I noticed this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“3 states” refers to the fact that you can set the output pins as either high, low or “high impedance.” … Neither example takes advantage of this feature and you won’t usually need to worry about getting a chip that has it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. One less thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I used whatever wires were available within the routing constraints and came up with this wiring:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-SN74HC595-HC-35-breadboard.jpg"><img src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-SN74HC595-HC-35-breadboard-thumb.jpg" width="400" title="ATtiny85 SN74HC595 Liyafy HC-35 keypad breadboard wiring" alt="[ ATtiny85 SN74HC595 Liyafy HC-35 keypad breadboard wiring ]"></a></p>
<p>The colors of the wires were dictated by available …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As someone who frequents the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php">PHP tag on StackOverflow</a> I pretty often see questions about how to parse some
particular aspect of HTML using regular expressions. A common reply to such a question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot parse HTML with regular expressions, because HTML isn’t regular. Use an XML parser instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement - in the context of the question - is somewhere between very misleading and outright wrong. What I’ll try
to demonstrate in this article is how powerful modern regular expressions <em>really</em> are.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-regular-actually-mean">What does “regular” actually mean?</h2>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language theory</a>, something is called “regular” when it has a grammar where all production
rules have one of the following forms:</p>



<p>You can read those <code>-&gt;</code> rules as “The left hand side can be replaced with the right hand side”. So the first rule would
be “B can be replaced with a”, the second one “B can be replaced with aC” and the third one “B can be replaced with the
empty string” (<code>ε</code> is the symbol for the empty string).</p>

<p>So what are <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>a</code>? By convention, uppercase characters denote so called “non-terminals” - symbols which <em>can</em>
be broken down further - and lowercase characters denote “terminals” - symbols which <em>cannot</em> be broken down any
further.</p>

<p>All that probably sounds a bit abstract, so let’s look at an example: Defining the natural numbers as a grammar.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N -&gt; 0
N -&gt; 1
N -&gt; 2
N -&gt; 3
N -&gt; 4
N -&gt; 5
N -&gt; 6
N -&gt; 7
N -&gt; 8
N -&gt; 9
N -&gt; 0N
N -&gt; 1N
N -&gt; 2N
N -&gt; 3N
N -&gt; 4N
N -&gt; 5N
N -&gt; 6N
N -&gt; 7N
N -&gt; 8N
N -&gt; 9N
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this grammar says is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A natural number (N) is
... one of the digits 0 to 9
or
... one of the digits 0 to 9 followed by another natural number (N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example the digits 0 to 9 would be terminals (as they can’t be broken down any further) and <code>N</code> would be the
only non-terminal (as it can be and is broken down further).</p>

<p>If you have another look at the rules and compare them to the definition of a regular grammar from above, you’ll see
that they meet the criteria: The first ten rules are of the form <code>B -&gt; a</code> and the second ten rules follow the form
<code>B -&gt; aC</code>. Thus the grammar defining the natural numbers is <em>regular</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing you might notice is that even though the above grammar defines such a simple thing, it is already quite
bloated. Wouldn’t it be better if we could express the same concept in a more concise manner?</p>

<p>And that’s where regular expressions come in: The above grammar is equivalent to the regex <code>[0-9]+</code> (which is a hell lot
simpler). And this kind of transformation can be done with <em>any</em> regular grammar: Every regular grammar has a
corresponding regular expression which defines all its valid strings.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-regular-expressions-match">What can regular expressions match?</h2>

<p>Thus the question arises: Can regular expressions match only regular grammars, or can they also match more? The answer
to this is both yes <em>and</em> no:</p>

<p>Regular expressions in the formal grammar sense can (pretty much by definition) only parse regular grammars and nothing
more.</p>

<p>But when programmers talk about “regular expressions” they aren’t talking about formal grammars. They are talking about
the regular expression <em>derivative</em> which their language implements. And those regex implementations are only very
slightly related to the original notion of regularity.</p>

<p>Any modern regex flavor can match a <em>lot</em> more than just regular languages. How much exactly, that’s what the rest of
the article is about.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, I’ll focus on the PCRE regex implementation in the following, simply because I know it best (as
it’s used by PHP). Most other regex implementations are quite similar though, so most stuff should apply to them too.</p>

<h2 id="the-language-hierarchy">The language hierarchy</h2>

<p>In order to analyze what regular expressions can and cannot match, we first have to look at what other types of
languages there are. A good starting point for this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Chomsky hierarchy:

/-------------------------------------------\
|                                           |
|     Recursively enumerable languages      | Type 0
|                                           |
|   /-----------------------------------\   |
|   |                                   |   |
|   |    Context-sensitive languages    |   | Type 1
|   |                                   |   |
|   |   /---------------------------\   |   |
|   |   |                           |   |   |
|   |   |  Context-free languages   |   |   | Type 2
|   |   |                           |   |   |
|   |   |   /-------------------\   |   |   |
|   |   |   | Regular languages |   |   |   | Type 3
|   |   |   \-------------------/   |   |   |
|   |   \---------------------------/   |   |
|   \-----------------------------------/   |
\-------------------------------------------/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see the Chomsky hierarchy divides formal languages into four types:</p>

<p>Regular languages (Type 3) are the least-powerful, followed by the context-free languages (Type 2), the
context-sensitive languages (Type 1) and at last the all-mighty recursively enumerable languages (Type 0).</p>

<p>The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy, so the smaller boxes in the above image are fully contained in the
larger boxes. For example every regular language is also a context-free language (but <em>not</em> the other way around!)</p>

<p>So, let’s move one step up in that hierarchy: We already know that regular expressions can match any regular language.
But can they also match context-free languages?</p>

<p>(Reminder: When I say “regular expression” here I obviously mean it in the programmer sense, not the formal language
theory sense.)</p>

<h2 id="matching-context-free-languages">Matching context-free languages</h2>

<p>The answer to this is <em>yes</em>, they can!</p>

<p>Let’s take the classical example of a context-free language, namely <code>{a^n b^n, n&gt;0}</code>, which means “A number of <code>a</code>
characters followed by the <em>same</em> number of <code>b</code> characters”. The (PCRE) regex for this language is:</p>



<p>The regular expression is very simple: <code>(?1)</code> is a reference to the first subpattern, namely <code>(a(?1)?b)</code>. So basically
you could replace the <code>(?1)</code> by that subpattern, thus forming a recursive dependency:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/^(a(?1)?b)$/
/^(a(a(?1)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)$/
/^(a(a(a(a(?1)?b)?b)?b)?b)$/
# and so on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the above expansions it should be clear that this expression can match any string with the same number of <code>a</code>s and
<code>b</code>s.</p>

<p>Thus regular expressions can match at least some non-regular, context-free grammars. But can they match all? To answer
that, we first have to look at how context-free grammars are defined.</p>

<p>In a context-free grammar all production rules take the following form:</p>



<p>Here <code>A</code> once again is a non-terminal symbol and <code>β</code> is an arbitrary string of terminals and non-terminals. Thus every
production rule of a context-free grammar has a non-terminal on the left hand side and an arbitrary symbol string on
the right hand side.</p>

<p>As an example, have a look at the following grammar:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function_declaration -&gt; T_FUNCTION is_ref T_STRING '(' parameter_list ')' '{' inner_statement_list '}'

is_ref -&gt; '&amp;'
is_ref -&gt; ε

parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list
parameter_list -&gt; ε

non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; parameter
non_empty_parameter_list -&gt; non_empty_parameter_list ',' parameter

// ... ... ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What you see there is an excerpt from the PHP grammar (just a few sample rules). The syntax is slightly different from
what we used before, but should be easy to understand. One aspect worth mentioning is that the uppercase <code>T_SOMETHING</code>
names here also are terminal symbols. These symbols which are usually called <em>tokens</em> encode more abstract concepts.
E.g. <code>T_FUNCTION</code> represents the <code>function</code> keyword and <code>T_STRING</code> is a label token (like <code>getUserById</code> or
<code>some_other_name</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using this example to show one thing: Context-free grammars are already powerful enough to encode quite complex
languages. That’s why pretty much all programming languages have a context-free grammar. In particular this also
includes well-formed HTML.</p>

<p>Now, back to the actual question: Can regular expressions match all context-free grammars? Once again, the answer is
<em>yes</em>!</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to prove as regular expressions (at least PCRE and similar) provide a syntax very similar to the
above for constructing grammars:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/
    (?(DEFINE)
        (?&lt;addr_spec&gt; (?&amp;local_part) @ (?&amp;domain) )

Google banned Element late Friday night, a ban thatÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355465650114846720">Element said</a> "is due to abusive content somewhere on Matrix." Matrix has millions of users, and as a federated chat protocol, Element does not control the content on Matrix, so this is a bit like banning a Web browser for displaying Web content. Element says it is working with Google to "explain how Element works and get the situation resolved."</p>
<p>Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/google-bans-parler-from-android-app-store/">been cracking down</a> on apps that display hateful content, but Element says that it shouldn't be part of the crackdown. "We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce," Element said. "We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content."</p>
<p>Element says it has a full-time team dedicated to handling abuse reports.</p>
<p>Element (which was formerly called Riot.im) is <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now">often cited</a> as one of the best Matrix clients. It looks a lot likeâ€”and is actually <a href="https://element.io/blog/slack-bridging/">interoperable with</a>â€”Slack and Discord. Element says it is used by "the French, German, UK and US governments, countless universities, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world." The app has recently seen <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">an influx of new users</a> after WhatsApp's announcement about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">Facebook data sharing</a>, so maybe that triggered deeper scrutiny from Google. At press time, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=matrix%20chat&amp;c=apps">many other Matrix apps</a>â€”which by definition show the same content as Elementâ€”are still active on the Play Store.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Google takes a 30 percent cut of all Play Store transactions, which is supposed to pay for the cost of running the Store, but the company doesn't hire humans to primarily review apps the way Apple does, choosing instead to let the bots handle it. Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apple-lowers-its-cut-of-app-store-revenues-for-some-developers/">recently cut</a> its App Store tax from 30 percent to 15 percent, so Apple actually charges developers less than Google while also offering better human support.
</p><p>Element's <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355595359582638080">latest update</a> on the situation as of this writing said it has been waiting more than eight hours for an email response. Element says it was not notified of the takedown, which has now passed the 24-hour mark.</p>
<p>The bots' interpretation of Google's rules often make no sense, and as a result Google regularly bans random small apps from the Play Store because they can display content from the Internet. We've seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/96kpsf/more_issues_with_google_play_suspended_for_hate/">Reddit apps,</a> <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/19/podcast-addict-pulled-play-store-allegedly-violating-coronavirus-policy/">podcast apps</a>, and other apps that display third-party Web content all "win" the Google Play ban-of-the-week lottery, just because they can be made to display third-party content. The same is true of Google Search, Chrome, Gmail, all of Google's chat apps, YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Podcasts, but those apps never get banned. Earlier this week Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/googles-bots-decide-ass-subtitle-support-is-too-risque-for-the-play-store/">banned a video app</a> because it listed support for the standard ".ass" subtitle filetype in its description.</p>
<p>The one benefit of the Play Store is that you don't have to use it, since Android supports sideloading. Element is also up <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">on F-Droid</a>, an all-open source repository of Android apps, though the version offered there is a month out of date. A more up-to-date version is on <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/vector-creations-limited/riot-im-communicate-your-way/riot-im-communicate-your-way-1-0-14-release/">APKmirror</a>, the Android hacking community's biggest app store.</p>
<p>These bans are almost always temporary mistakes that are rectified after a few hours or days, but that gives little solace to app developers who can suddenly have their businesses ripped out from under them because of an enforcement mistake. Element says, "we can only apologize for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this."</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Element got in touch with a person at Google and says the app should be back up soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update: we just got a call from a Google VP who explained the suspension was triggered by a report of extremely abusive content accessible on the <a href="https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e">https://t.co/g01j4u6O2e</a> server. Our trust &amp; safety team had already acted on it, and the app should be reinstated shortly.</p>

        <h2 id="github-should-start-an-app-store">GitHub Should Start An App Store</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443">without any reasonable explanation</a>. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-github">But Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:</p>
<ol>
<li>They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.</li>
<li>Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl</a> debacle.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.</li>
<li>They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves</li>
<li>This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.</li>

        <p>There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers. </p>
<h2>First, what happened</h2>
<p>On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of "Buy!" and "Hold!" from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.</p>
<p>As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.</p>
<p>That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">Levine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">Robinhood</a></p>
<p>So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html">scrounged up some capital</a> so they could continue on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robinhood's Clearing Firm</h3>
<p>Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates. </p>
<h3>update 12:32 - On margin?</h3>
<p>Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood "instant transfers" provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.</p>
<p>Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation.  So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have "instant transfers".</p>
<p>Again, this is about what's effectively <em>collateral</em> the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction <em>settles</em>, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.</p>
<h2>But why ONLY Buys?</h2>
<p>The deposit requirement is </p>
<p><code>deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market</code></p>
<p>And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility
estimation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf">SEC</a></p>
<p>Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, "99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X". You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Bad Desmos Graphs</h3>
<p>So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2" alt=""></p>
<p>Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, now it's even more to the right! </p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>buys make this worse</strong>, <strong>sells make it better</strong>. Robinhood <em>could not</em> execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by.  Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.</p>
<p>These brokers halted buys of GME</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood</li>
<li>Webull</li>
<li>M1 Finance</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>E-Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>While others only halted options</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive</li>
<li>TDA</li>
<li>Schwab</li>
<li>Tradeing212</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).</p>
<p>(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)</p>
<p>Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.</p>
<h2>Stay or Switch?</h2>
<p>If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier. </p>
<p>And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.</p>
<p>And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).</p>
<p>Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>What does Emacs need for us to someday run M-x neuralink-mode and evaluate Lisp in the brain?</p><div><p>I started using <a href="https://github.com/mpereira/.emacs.d/commit/30024f963ed794ec3a4c41229dbd4fab81f9b912">Emacs</a> almost exactly four years ago, after almost a decade
of <a href="https://github.com/mpereira/.vim">Vim</a>. I made the switch cold turkey. I vividly remember being <em>extremely</em>
frustrated by unbearable slowness while editing a Clojure file at work.
With no sane way of debugging it, just moving the cursor up and down would
result in so much lag that I had to step away from the computer to breathe
for a while. When I came back I quit Vim (I knew how at that point), opened
Emacs, and started building my configuration.</p><p>More recently, I’ve been very put off by the performance and stability (or
lack thereof) of building large scale software via Tramp. This has been
sufficient to have me looking out again. On a whim, I installed VSCode for
the first time and tried its “remote development” capabilities and holy
smokes are they good. Getting up and running was trivial and the
performance was great. Saving files was snappy and LSP worked out of the
box. What a different experience from my carefully-put-together,
half-working, slow Emacs setup.</p><p>My common denominator for rage-quitting software seems to be
consistent: <i>bad performance</i>.</p><p>There has recently been more discussion than usual regarding “modernizing”
Emacs, by making keybindings more consistent with other applications and
using more attractive color schemes and visuals, with the end goal of
attracting more users and by extension more contributors.</p><p>In my view improving these aspects of user experience wouldn’t hurt. The
way I see it, though, is that for Emacs to attract more users it needs to
be objectively better than the alternatives. And the way to do it is for
Emacs to become <em>even more</em> like Emacs.</p><p>I see Emacs as being fundamentally two things: a programmable runtime,
and a beacon for free software. I'm talking more about the former.</p><p>It needs to be a <em>more</em> robust, <em>more</em> efficient, and <em>more</em> integrated
platform with a <em>more</em> powerful extension language, to empower its users to
build their own environment.</p><p>Getting LSP integrated <em>pervasively</em> in Emacs in a way that it reliably
<em>just works</em> and performs well out of the box, would go a long way towards
making Emacs more attractive not just to new users, but to existing ones
too. Imagine an experience similar to VSCode’s:</p><ol><li>Open Emacs for the first time</li><li>Open a source code file</li><li>Emacs asks if you want it to configure itself for the programming
language of that source file</li><li>Saying “yes” automatically sets up Emacs to have a modern programming
environment for that programming language with smart code completion,
navigation, and refactoring, rich hover information, highlighting,
automatic formatting, snippets, etc. Maybe even open a side window with
a buffer with a short “getting started” tutorial showing the available
keybindings.</li></ol><p>Given enough users, opinionated community-built Emacs “distributions” like
Spacemacs, Doom, and Prelude will do the job of making it easier for
newcomers to get started with typical contemporary tasks: building software
with popular programming languages, writing documents, managing machines,
etc.</p><p>Building and maintaining these “distributions” also becomes much easier
given a more robust, more efficient, and more integrated platform with a
more powerful extension language.</p><p>Having a <a href="https://blog.polaris64.net/post/could-emacs-have-a-set-up-wizard/">wizard</a> showing up in new Emacs installations might be a great
low-hanging fruit way of making Emacs more accessible. Assuming buy-in from
core maintainers, the wizard could even directly reference popular Emacs
“distributions” like the ones mentioned above, so that new users can
kickstart their lives in Emacs.</p><p>The way to attract contributors can also be <em>stated</em> simply: directly improve
the contribution process.</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8">Many</a> have created their Emacs <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/xemacs-wishlist.html">wishlists</a>. This is mine:</p><ol><li>Improved single-core efficiency</li><li>Improved display efficiency and rendering engine</li><li>Leveraging preemptive parallelism</li><li>Emacs Lisp improvements</li><li>Enhanced stability</li><li>Dealing with non-text</li><li>Improved contribution and development process</li></ol><p>Let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="1-dot-improved-single-core-efficiency">1. Improved single-core efficiency</h2><p>There are two dimensions to this:</p><ul><li>garbage collection efficiency</li><li>code execution efficiency</li></ul><p>For the past one and a half years, <a href="https://twitter.com/Koral%5F001">Andrea Corallo</a>, a compiler engineer,
has been <a href="https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html">working</a> on adding native compilation capabilities to the Emacs
Lisp interpreter. His work is available in a branch in the official Emacs
repository. Folks have been trying it out, and according to the reports
I’m hearing, the results are staggeringly positive. I am <em>very</em> excited
about Andrea’s work, which seems to bring enough improvement to the “code
execution speed” side of the equation to make it a non-issue for now.</p><p>Andrea’s work will also allow for more of Emacs to be implemented in Emacs
Lisp itself (instead of C), which is what most contributors are used to.
This is a great win for maintainability and extensibility: incrementally
having more and more of Emacs be implemented in the language with which
it’s extended.</p><p>The garbage collector is still in much need of improvement. Many resort to
hacks to ameliorate frequent and sometimes long pauses that seem to be
unavoidable while working on large git repositories, fast-scrolling
font-locked Eshell buffers, displaying dynamically updating child frames,
navigating big Org files, and many other tasks.</p><p><span>Also, try this out:</span> <code>(setq garbage-collection-messages t)</code></p><h2 id="2-dot-improved-display-efficiency-and-rendering-engine">2. Improved display efficiency and rendering engine</h2><p>The display implementation in Emacs core is… less than ideal.</p><blockquote><p>GNU Emacs is an old-school C program emulating a 1980s Symbolics Lisp
Machine emulating an old-fashioned Motif-style Xt toolkit emulating a
1970s text terminal emulating a 1960s teletype. Compiling Emacs is a
challenge. Adding modern rendering features to the redisplay engine is a
miracle.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-colascione/buttery-smooth-emacs/10155313440066102/">Daniel Colascione in “Buttery Smooth Emacs” (2016)</a></p></blockquote><p>It would be great if Emacs did like Neovim and decoupled the editor
runtime from the display engine. This would make it possible for the
community to build powerful <a href="https://neovim.io/news/2020/10/#guis">GUIs</a> without having to change <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/master/src/xdisp.c">Emacs core</a>,
possibly <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CAO2hHWbUmgirn1gJ4OGbRghhCkOPcEsL=moc82Q-6QO+C=189Q@mail.gmail.com/">using technology</a> <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jPGhC-0003i1-W4@fencepost.gnu.org/">not fully sanctioned</a> by core maintainers.</p><p>Take a look at the screenshots of these Neovim GUIs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Kethku/neovide">neovide</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/smolck/uivonim">uivonim</a></li></ul><p>They’re powerful, look great, perform well, and more importantly, are
based on industry standard, cross-platform graphics APIs (Vulkan and WebGL
respectively) that get lots of personpower contributions from companies
and individuals alike.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/40303878">Onivim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi</a> text editors could also be sources of inspiration:</p><ul><li>Separating the core runtime from the user interface</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope%5F(data%5Fstructure)">Ropes</a> for faster incremental changes and parallelization of text
operations</li><li>Game-like drawing pipelines</li></ul><h2 id="3-dot-leveraging-preemptive-parallelism">3. Leveraging preemptive parallelism</h2><p>Emacs does not support parallel code execution via multi-core processing.
Code execution happening on any buffer will freeze the whole program,
preventing not only user interaction but other cooperative threads of
execution from making progress as well.</p><p>Adding parallelism to Emacs in a way that automatically makes existing
code run in parallel is about as close to impossible as it can get. What
would be more feasible is including new primitives for parallel execution
that new code could leverage, to build more powerful extensions to Emacs.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng">Emacs-ng</a> is a recent effort that implements just that: an additive layer
over Emacs that brings not only parallelism, but also asynchronous I/O
capabilities via an embedded <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> runtime, and GPU-based rendering via
<a href="https://github.com/servo/webrender">WebRender</a>. I am <em>super</em> excited about the very fast progress from the folks
working on emacs-ng, and I think the project holds great promise for the
future of Emacs itself.</p><p>There also seems to be advances in the area of immutable data structures
that could be leveraged by the Emacs core, as seen in “<a href="https://public.sinusoid.es/misc/immer/immer-icfp17.pdf">Persistence for the
Masses: RRB-Vectors in a Systems Language</a>”. Persistent data structures
would make building thread-safe parallel code much easier.</p><h2 id="4-dot-enhanced-stability">4. Enhanced stability</h2><p>It is very easy to either freeze Emacs or cause it to run very slowly.
Multiple times a day I have to hit <code>C-g</code> incessantly to bring it back from
being frozen. When that fails, I am sometimes able to get it back with
<code>pkill -SIGUSR2 Emacs</code>. At least once per week I have to <code>pkill -9 Emacs</code>
because it turned completely unresponsive. I suspect doing more work
outside of the main thread might help with this?</p><p>There are many hacks to ameliorate issues caused by long lines, but
they’re still fundamentally there. Advancements in the “display efficiency
and rendering engine” effort would help with this too.</p><p>I recently tried a package that displays pretty icons on completion
prompts, and noticed that it made scrolling through candidates really
slow. Profiling showed that the package was creating thousands of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/elisp/Idle-Timers.html">timers</a>,
which were somehow causing the issue. There are lots of cases like this,
where folks attempt to create something nice, but inevitably have to
resort to <a href="https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el/issues/113">hacks</a> to either achieve acceptable performance, or to be able to
implement the thing at all. Having a more robust/efficient/integrated core
with a more powerful extension language would help here.</p><p>Impressive efforts from folks like Lars Ingebrigtsen who routinely comes
in and <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2020/10/26/5x10/">obliterates 10% of all reported Emacs bugs</a> also have a sizable
impact. We users should follow the lead and do a better job not only
creating good bug reports but also dipping in our toes and helping out:
fixing bugs, writing tests, and documentation.</p><p>Yuan Fu recently wrote a <a href="https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/contributing-to-emacs/">nice guide</a> for contributing to Emacs.</p><h2 id="5-dot-emacs-lisp-improvements">5. Emacs Lisp improvements</h2><p>Emacs Lisp is a much better language than Vimscript. Unfortunately, that’s
not saying much. It’s not a particularly good Lisp and has lots of room
for improvement.</p><blockquote><p>For example, if you want to use a map, you have three choices: you can use
alists, plists or hash maps. There are no namespaces in Emacs Lisp, so for
each of the three data types you get a bunch of functions with weird
names. For alists get is <code>assoc</code> and set is <code>add-to-list</code>, for hash maps get
is <code>gethash</code> and set is <code>puthash</code>, for plists get is <code>plist-get</code> and set is
<code>plist-put.</code> For each of those types it …</p></blockquote></div></div>

Examples include seeing the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items</a>, and the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches-with-no-results" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items with no results</a>.</p>
<p>Physical retailers don’t want to be left&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>So many different ways to monitor shoppers in physical stores have been&nbsp;developed.</p>
<p>Amazon Go stores extensively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/" target="_blank">use cameras</a> to track everything that happens inside their&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Many stores provide free WiFi so that they can <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/" target="_blank">track their customers</a>.</p>
<p>All these solutions have a big problem:&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Cameras see everything – much more than they need. And this data is collected and stored. Free WiFi hotspots may capture all kinds of&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>This is an obvious privacy problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>But it is not just a problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>It also creates a major problem for the companies storing the data: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/silicon-valley-terrified-california-privacy-law/" target="_blank">personally identifiable data is a liability</a>.</p>
<p>This is why we chose vibration sensors and light sensors. No liability from owning any personally identifiable&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual&nbsp;shoppers.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-shopper-behavior">Understanding shopper&nbsp;behavior</h2>
<p>As a shopper, you want to find the best products, and – ideally – pay the lowest possible&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>The retailers and producers have slightly different&nbsp;motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands want customer to buy their products, and not their&nbsp;competitors’</li>
<li>Retailers want to sell more&nbsp;products</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the motivations of shoppers, retailers, and brands align, business is made. And the more business, the better for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Understanding customer behavior is key to improving the experience for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The sensors detect when people are looking at items. And they report this immediately, so that we can see in real-time where shoppers&nbsp;are.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wireless-iot-mesh-network-">Why use a wireless IoT mesh&nbsp;network?</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a wireless network that automatically extend its&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh network solution uses so-called <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/what-is-subghz-networking/" target="_blank">sub-GHz wireless technology</a> that has way better range than traditional WiFi or&nbsp;Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But even with a longer range, it is not always&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Electronics stores can be very large. And there is plenty of metal inside them that hampers the wireless&nbsp;coverage.</p>
<p>A mesh network is the ideal technology in these&nbsp;situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Coverage</strong>. Electronics stores can be huge. With a mesh network, we can cover it&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It just works</strong>. No network planning is&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to install</strong>. Just put each device where it should&nbsp;be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to maintain</strong>. If there are issues with coverage, just add extenders as&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>. If something changes, the network will automatically adapt and&nbsp;overcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the wireless mesh network typically looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div>
<div data-layout="grid" data-controls="#filterControls" data-animation="quicksand" data-x-gap="32" data-y-gap="32" data-media-queries="[
{&quot;width&quot;: 1500, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 1100, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 800, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 480, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 300, &quot;cols&quot;: 1}
]">
<div>
<p><small>
The IoT mesh network uses range extenders to cover the entire area of the electronics store.
</small>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this deployment, the mesh network used one access point and two extenders. Most device are able to reach the access point directly, but some chose to talk to one of the&nbsp;extenders.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery&nbsp;life</h2>
<p>The sensors are equipped with batteries: one coin-cell battery&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh system is <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">tailored for extreme low-power operation</a>. Extreme low-power operation in this case means that the sensors can go for several months one a single&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>For example, the sensors are automatically turned off at night, to conserve their precious&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the Thingsquare system continuously collects power consumption data from each and every&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>This data lets us see the exact behavior at any given time: are there any sensors that behave in a way that require their batteries to be replaced earlier? The Thingsquare system knows the answers to this, and alerts us if this would be the&nbsp;case.</p>
<div>
<div data-layout="grid" data-controls="#filterControls" data-animation="quicksand" data-x-gap="32" data-y-gap="32" data-media-queries="[
{&quot;width&quot;: 1500, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 1100, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 800, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 480, &quot;cols&quot;: 1},
{&quot;width&quot;: 300, &quot;cols&quot;: 1}
]">
<div>
<p><small>
Each sensor measures and reports a detailed break-down of their power consumption.
</small>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2>
<p>The ioT mesh network is connected to the Internet via a 4G modem. The network maintains a stable encrypted connection to the backend system so that the devices always can be&nbsp;reached.</p>
<p>If the Internet connection would go down at any point during the deployment, the devices hold off from reporting their data until the Internet connection is&nbsp;restored.</p>
<p>With this technique, no data is ever&nbsp;lost.</p>

Broadly speaking, it is an attempt to give you an opportunity to take a look at Rome as it really was, by the eyes of humans who lived there in that time. Due to this, we are already paying much attention (and will proceed) to the level of details, adding realistic materials, colors, visual and weather effects. That’s why we are concentrating just on the center of the Rome for now, just to focus on quality and details.</p><p>Now we are planning to add a little additional territory (such as Circus Maximus, Velabrum area), and release our project as a 3d walkthrough application. I hope we will be able to complete it in a year approximately.</p> <img src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" data-src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" data-srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w"><p>Boasting some impressive in-video lighting features, the animation focuses on the monumental scale that was flaunted by Rome during its apical architectural stage.

    <div><p>Pioneered 2000 years ago by Aristotle and popularized most recently by Elon Musk, <em>First Principles</em> is a method of reasoning which involves breaking down a complex problem into its most fundamental parts and reasoning upwards from there.</p>
<p>In his interview with Kevin Rose, Musk says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So the normal way we conduct our lives is, we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are doing… with slight iterations on a theme. And it’s … mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world, and what that really means is, you … boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “okay, what are we sure is true?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given his ubiquitous popularity in the mainstream culture, it is easy to forget that what Musk is doing is literally <em>unearthly</em>! Take a minute and read <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">this page</a> on SpaceX's mission statement. It's hard to fathom how courageous, confident and clear one needs to be in their thinking, to come up with a plan to colonize Mars(!) and saying it publicly without the fear of being ridiculed. How does he do it?</p>
<p>He takes an insanely complicated problem, goes to the bottom of it and comes up with intuitive solutions which people before him never came up with because they reasoned by analogy. Notice how this theme of <em>first principles</em> based problem-solving underlies all of his work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SpaceX</strong> — Space flight is crazy expensive. Why? Because we use new rockets for every launch. That sounds dumb. Let's find a way to make reusable rockets. To the layman it sounds obvious. But why didn't people before him question these basics? Lack of <em>first principles</em> based thinking.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tesla</strong> — Fuel-based automobiles are bad for the planet. Why can't people switch to electric cars? Because they are not battery efficient, lack performance and are often poorly designed. Boom! Tesla now builds some of the most good looking and fastest cars on the planet.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Boring Company</strong> — There's too much traffic on the road. Why? Human settlements are multiple storeyed. But human transport is still archaic and restricted to one plane. Let's change that by boring underground transportation tunnels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this sounds so damn obvious and it is hard to believe that people never questioned these basic premises in their fields. It is mind-blowing how restrictive reasoning by analogy can be.</p>
<h2 id="first-principles-approach-to-life">First Principles Approach to Life</h2>
<p>I know. <em>First principles</em> seems overly simplistic in theory. But trust me, it can be quite difficult to implement. Now I don't know how to make rockets like Elon but over time I have learned how to use <em>first principles</em> as a strategy for living life.</p>
<p>Living abroad and building your life from scratch in a new country is a great way to identify with these principles. In retrospect, I realise that the most fundamental elements of my life were often the things which I took for granted while living at home. Which included my physical and mental health, my friends and family, and a sense of belonging which your homeland provides.</p>
<p>Lockdown-induced self-introspection made 2020 a year of tremendous personal growth and I realised that I had made a lot of decisions in my personal and professional life which did not allign with my principles. But that's okay. We all get influenced by culture and the people around us. We try to replicate other people's life strategies because we see them working. Once you identify and build your life around your own principles, you quickly become unapologetic and make decisions without seeking external validation.</p>
<p>Imagine your life is a tree and every decision you make branches you out into the world. Now all trees branch out differently so it is futile to imitate the trees around you. Of course, you can get some idea about what kind of decisions lead you where but it is really stupid to shape yourself in somebody else's reflection. The reason why <em>first principles</em> drastically improves your decision making and life satisfaction is because every decision you take, every new branch you create, is strongly attached to your own core. Even if it doesn't work out, you will love it as your own.</p>
<p>As it often happens with people, your principles may change over time and that's okay. You can rebranch your tree gradually but honestly, I do believe that there are some core, non-negotiable principles to live a good life. These can also be a good starting point to create your own list of <em>first principles</em>. Here are three undeniable ones — taking care of your body, maintaining healthy relationships and doing satisfying work which pays the bills. Everytime I find myself in a rut, I reason upwards from here.</p>
<h2 id="first-principles-as-opposed-to-backwards-induction">First Principles as opposed to <em>Backwards Induction</em></h2>
<p>I have never found it useful to set specific goals. An unpopular opinion, I know. A notoriously flawed concept in self-improvement circles is the concept of S.M.A.R.T. goals. It is an acronym for goals which are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. This life strategy is a derivative of <em>Backwards Induction</em> way-of-reasoning where you take the end goal in mind and reason backwards from there. Personally, I've found this strategy to be too restrictive and given my temparament and personality-type, I have always enjoyed some amount of spontaneity in life. I like to diversify my interests, trying different things and adjusting my sails as I move forward making sure that I don't miss the forest for the trees. In Tim Minchin's words, "the disciplined pursuit of short-term goals."</p>
<p>I would rather aim to build systems which are in allignment with my principles. Instead of setting a goal to run a sub-4 hour marathon in 6 months, it is more sustainable to create a system which allows me to become a better runner. This means I run every other day, focus on recovery and nutrition, and push my self everyday without injuring myself. Since I don't care about the specifics, I am never dissapointed even if I fail to reach these arbitary metrics. You might say that every system inherently has a goal, no matter how vague. That is true. But the important point is not to make these goals <em>too</em> specific.</p>
<p>This way, reasoning by <em>first principles</em> clears your head, getting rid of assumptions, external influences and perceived limitations drastically improving life satisfaction.</p>

<p>First occurrence on <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter" title="Eth0:2010 Winter">eth0:2010 Winterlan</a>, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270">LACK</a> (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block.
It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.
</p><p>The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer" title="Eth0:2010 Summer">eth0:2010 Summer</a>.
</p>

Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19" hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19" gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19" switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!
</p>
<p>You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/">this page</a>. This includes the proof that a 19" switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack-w-switch.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/d/d7/Lackrack-w-switch.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="188" data-file-width="2592" data-file-height="1944"></a></p><div><p>Close-up of the LackRack, with a switch, in its natural habitat (the IKEA)</p></div></div></div>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:5x_lackrack.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/9/99/5x_lackrack.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" data-file-width="800" data-file-height="800"></a></p><div><p>Illustration of the LackRack's modularity</p></div></div></div><p><i>For assembly in terms of a programming language, this is not the page you need.</i>
</p><p>However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:
</p>
<ul><li>1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea</li>
<li>Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)</li>
<li>Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1" in length)</li>
<li>Spare time</li></ul>
<p>That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK.
After that, the installation of your 19" hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/">this link</a> describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.
</p><p>The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.
</p>
<ul><li>If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.</li></ul>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/7/76/Lackrack2.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="400" data-file-width="1536" data-file-height="2048"></a></p><div><p>Due to their light weight design, Lackracks will grow to any required size without compromise</p></div></div></div>
<p>Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!
</p>
<ul><li><i>Optional but recommended</i> - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down</li>
<li>Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
<ul><li>If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
<ul><li>With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.</li></ul></li>
<li>&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Profit! (note how <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rackable.com/">lackable.com</a> has been bought by sgi recently)</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Note">Note</span></h2>
<p>Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2") is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s">these</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Goodies">Goodies</span></h2>
<ul><li>You can put food and/or drink on your rack.</li>
<li>You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.</li>
<li>The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
<ul><li>That means, no more dull black/gray racks!</li>
<li>Or you can put <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack2.jpg" title="File:Lack2.jpg">stickers of your favorite event</a> on them.</li></ul></li>
<li>It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. <span>red</span> for critical services, <span>grey</span> for office automation, <span>green</span> for file-servers, <span>black</span> for systems and network management.</li>

<ul><li>Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
<ul><li>A: Only if you add it yourself</li></ul></li>
<li>Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
<ul><li>A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances <b>in</b> the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/00095036">Ikea LACK coffee table</a>: almost twice as deep, and comes with a shelf. Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19" server rack photography.
It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.
</p><p>Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.

<p>It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products
rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19"
equipment. See <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/List_of_IkeaRacks" title="List of IkeaRacks">List_of_IkeaRacks</a>

In case you aren’t familiar with the term “data warehouse”, it’s basically a database that centralizes your data to be used for analysis. There are many databases you can choose from, for example in Simon Willison’s talk, he uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I chose <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> because I’m familiar with it and so far I have liked what Ive seen. Some features that make it stand out for me are things like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html">time travel</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table.html">undrop table</a>, a rich set of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-operators-functions.html">functions</a>, among many others.</p><p>Ok great, so we now have an empty database to start with. But a database is only useful when there is data in it to query. So we must choose which datasets to pull into our freshly minted database. I’m going to start with bringing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> data because I’m a big fan of the site and it has an actual <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> which means we wont have to be scraping HTML. I’m also going to bring in stock data into the warehouse to see if we can get any stock information out of Hacker News. Finally we’ll analyze the stock market and correlate stocks to the latest GameStop stock craze.</p><p>The first part of the plan will be to get the Hacker News data loaded into Snowflake. Then I’ll use Snowflake’s Data Marketplace to bring in the stock data, which will save me from writing an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).</p><h2>Getting an initial dump of the Hacker News data.</h2><p>I wanted to write as little code as possible to get this initial historical dump of Hacker News so I decided to use a combination of curl, bash and parallel to get the job done. I first used <a href="https://ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a> to find a relatively cheap CPU per dollar machine. I spun up a c5a.8xlarge on AWS which has 32 vCPUs.<br>I wouldn’t be surprised if there were cheaper options, but I just eyeballed it.</p><p>Let’s get the largest item ID:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611791428293_3993"><div><pre><code>curl https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json</code></pre></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611792427454_4138"><div><p>Which returned: 25,806,058</p><p>Sigh, looks like we’re going to have to do 25 million HTTP calls.

To quote Dyatlov from Chernobyl, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg5HOnq7zD0">“Not great, not terrible”</a>.</p><p>I ended up writing a python <a href="https://github.com/thomasdziedzic/hackernews-fill-gaps/blob/master/main.py">script</a> to calculate and download these missing items. If you know how one would generate the missing ids between the gaps (which could be of variable size), I would sure like to learn how you accomplish that because it might have spared me from writing this python script. Moving on…</p><p>I also found that the API returns some nulls for items. So I ran the following to clean those up:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611854158631_21920"><div><pre><code>delete from items where id is null;

We must do better, for the sake of my wallet.</p><p>I gave up trying to figure out how to do it purely from a shell scripting perspective, and wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/thomasdziedzic/hackernews-etl/blob/master/main.py">Python script</a> to figure out which items it needs to extract, and then load into Snowflake. This script can be run without user intervention and will keep the data up-to-date. Using Python to write the ELT gave me more flexibility to fix some things that I saw as issues. For example, the script starts N * 4 (where N is the number of logical cpus) jobs and only produces N * 4 files instead of 1 file per item. This approach will avoid having to do an expensive file combination step at the end. I also added some awesome progress bars to the script so that I knew how many requests remain thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar/issues/21#issuecomment-766468695">Tai Sakuma</a>.</p><p>Running this script from my laptop (a Dell 9370 Developer Edition with 8 logical cores) and spotty Wi-Fi, script extracts items from the API at about 130 items/second. This is slower than extracting from a c5a.8xlarge machine, but at least my laptop isn’t charging me $1.232/hour for using it. And my script has the benefit of not having to combine millions of tiny files at the end. Let’s test my incremental loading script out on an ec2 instance to see how it really compares with my naive approach.</p><h2>Downloading incremental data from Hacker News using my script</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611883239126_31321"><div><pre><code>$ time { poetry run python main.py ; }

<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>

<p>I have been engaging with WSB (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/r/WallStreetBets</a>) since 2014.</p>
<p>Every regular person on WSB understands it’s a game. You can loose it all, make it big, sometimes both in the same day — it’s all a game. The most accurate assessment of WSB culture was clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the influx of new users may change the community, prior to January 15, 2021 the above was indeed an accurate description.</p>

<p>Honestly, this world feels like we are in a simulation. The company GameStop appears to be poised to bring down the entire financial system — stopping the game.</p>
<p>The infinity squeeze appears to be coming, what is an infinity squeeze you ask? It’s a really massive short squeeze:</p>
<blockquote><p>A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock’s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Short positions can technically lead to infinite losses. Simply put, if I open a short position for $10 and the share price drops 10%, I make $1. However, if the stock price increases say 10,000% I now owe $1,000.</p>
<p>In the case of GameStop, the situation appears dire. At one point the short positions were 140% of available shares of the market. This means that more shares were lent out than were available on float, i.e. shorts were resold / lent several times. At this point, several things are happening[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsaleclosed.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those holding short positions are paying ridiculously high interest rates</li>
<li>If the short positions were forced to close, it would cause a major loss to multiple hedge funds (tens of billions total &amp; bankrupcies)</li>
<li>Due to the level of shorting, exiting the short positions would be excessively expensive and cause a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short squeeze</a></li>
<li>There is less GameStop stock available for purchase</li>
<li>The price of GameStop stock is rising</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it appears to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short holders cannot exit their positions without going bankrupt</li>
<li>Short holders are being hit by high interest rates</li>
<li>Closing other positions in the stock market should help them cover the interest rates</li>
<li>Best option for short position holders is is to wait &amp; pray the stock price drops</li>
<li>What happens if not enough people are willing to sell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believe all of this will suck all the liquidity from the stock market. Either those shorting suffer the loss and close their positions or wait as the stock continues to stay high… in either case hundreds of billions of dollars is leaving the market.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Short Positions</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to this story I’ll come back an fill in, but the gist is this — In mid-January 2021 GameStop was <em>extremely</em> shorted.</p>

<p>The massive short position and didn’t go unnoticed, WSB had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201222153244/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing it for months</a>. That being said, the massive spikes in purchases did not start until January 12:</p>

<p>What happened at that time? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210118091858/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO updates</a> definitely started at that time and stocks started to rise. Once the stocks started to rise, I believe institutions and WSB itself started piling into GameStop. The stock started to move and if they could get in they could make a boat load. It’s important to remember WSB is often visited by hedge fund mangers, CEOs, day traders big and small, etc. It’s not always the little guy(s). When they piled in, the price started to rise further.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Make Money</h3>
<p>As they purchased, I personally believe some short sellers managed to exit their positions (about 7m shares, per Yahoo Finance data)</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w"></a></p>
<p>What this indicates to me is that many of those holding short positions did not realize what was about to happen. They kept holding believing this was a classic pump-and-dump. Even WSB at the time didn’t not necessarily think about much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115023914/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">besides making money</a>. I know I even purchased call options during this week, particularly when the new data came out January 15, 2021. To me, it became clear the stock was about to rocket.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Stick it to the Man</h3>
<p>In light of the massive number of short position(s) open in January 15, 2021, WSB realized they could (a) make money and (b) stick it to the hedge funds. Frankly, WSB have been waging a war on short selling for years. With GameStop they had a company with relatively few shares&nbsp; in float (47m), a low market cap, basically something that purchases would have an outsized impact.</p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure this was intentional, but as people started buying and holding waiting for the squeeze the stock started to rise.The rising stock both led to discussions on news outlets and the stock started going viral on social media platforms outside of WSB – further raising the going rate for a share of GameStop.</p>
<p>Those holding short positions did not want to sell as they’d lose money, so they were searching for capital to cover their leveraged positions. Citadel and Point72 partners appears to have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come to at least one short sellers aid</a>. This showed they were weak and further emboldened the WSB folks – “Let’s make some money on the hedge funds behalf”</p>
<p>Purchases from Jan 19 to Jan 23, 2021 and the stock price increased exponentially as it went viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" alt="" width="507" height="423" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w"></a></p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – The Rebellion</h3>
<p>On January 27, 2021 across the board buying for GameStop was <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/money/2021/01/27/robinhood-td-ameritrade-other-brokerages-have-tech-problems-at-market-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricted (along with multiple other stocks) across various trading platforms</a>. This effectively forced purchase volume lower and as users of these platforms could only sell it drove down the share price. This likely startled many GameStop shareholds and many liquidated their positions, letting the short sellers exit some of their positions. Through January 29, 2021 the ability to purchase in an unrestricted manner has not been restored.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Personally, I’m of the opinion that there was not enough shares to go around and likely these platforms colluded to drive down the stock price. What’s more interesting is how few people sold. As of January 29, 2021 the price of a GameStop share was back at $325. This has led to some very VERY strong backlash and I know I’ll be joining a lawsuit at some point (if not filing my own), as this collusion cost me tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One essay that particularly struck me was made on WSB: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130034124/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading the comments on this essay to really get an under standing of what’s happening. Look at the charts. This is personal now. The market manipulation is obvious and people want revenge. For the current events, for 2008, for the entire corrupt system. They want to send a message. This is a protest.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="567" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w"></a>Many retail investors will hold until the bitter end.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – End Game</h3>
<p>So what happens next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting on January 27-29 people were trying to transfer funds off Robinhood and the other platforms which disabled purchasing of GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Come the <span>first week of February</span> these assets will be again available and can be used to purchase GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Everyone saw much fewer shares being traded Friday</li>
<li>Everyone is talking with their families</li>
<li>People are going to purchase more GameStop shares &amp; hold</li>
<li>I expect many are going to pull their assets out of the stock market</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some unknowns, for instance have the short positions been closed? Have there been backroom deals to stave off the infinity squeeze?</p>
<p>If neither of those assumptions above hold, then what happens when the price rises further and there’s not enough shares for sale?</p>
<p>Hedge funds either bleed out as they pay the massive interest rates on holding those short positions or they will close their short positions causing an infinity squeeze (GameStop shares will be priced in the thousands). In either case hundreds of billions would likely leave the market.</p>
<h3>Conclusion – The Black Hole</h3>
<p>It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nash Equilibrium</a>, essentially the share holders have every reason to ask the maximum amount they can get for a share of GameStop (i.e. make money). If for some reason these GameStop share holders are unwilling to sell at a low rate, then these hedge funds stand to lose hundreds of billions and will go bankrupt (slowly via interest payments or quickly via short squeeze). To try and pay for their debts, they’ll have to sell off market wide and the entire market collapses.</p>
<p>There are three ways to alleviate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>GameStop issues a massive number of new shares</li>
<li>Market manipulation (such as Robinood and friends only enabling selling – of course that didn’t work last time)</li>
<li>Government settles the matter by confiscating shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I view government involvement as inevitable. They could settle everyone accounts fairly by giving everyone the current share price or what they bought it for, which every is higher. That being said, I suspect the more likely course of action is some flat rate $100/share or something to that effect. In either case, if they don’t get involved, I suspect the system really will collapse.</p>
<p>Unless of course, I am wrong. I am not a financial expert and nothing in this article should be taken as advice.</p>
<p>It’s completely possible I’m inaccurately reading the situation and those shorting GameStop have already exited their position(s) and GameStop is currently just in a classic bubble.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355290296947499013" target="_blank">Google recently blocked the Matrix based chat app Element from the Play Store sighting sexual content on the platform.</a> It’s really hard to define the explanation because WhatsApp, Telegram users of other chat clients also share the same content. <a href="https://www.redpoints.com/blog/telegram-book-piracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telegram is also known to host groups sharing pirated content as well.</a></p>
<p>This post is not going to bash Google on the ban of Element. It’s about how Google can win the chat app, but how google can build a chat app based on an open chat protocol and create a winning chat platform for them.</p>
<p>Chat apps have been hot for the past couple of years. When I initially Tweeted that chat apps are the new social network, 6-7 years ago (I wish if I can find that tweet, but I can’t seem to find it, maybe it was lost when I deleted all my tweets sometime ago), I remember how people laughed replying how can that even possible, but now as Facebook is on the decline, chat apps are the goto place to hang out with friends.</p>
<p>Google currently doesn’t have a house in the chat app race. Google tried with several chat applications, like Allo, Hangout, Google Talk, none of them took off. Even though Allo looked promising, and was integrated into Android, people never jumped the ship to Allo. And since Google now allowing several chat/video platforms like Hangout, Meet etc, Google’s direction in communication platform seems big vague.</p>
<p>Google also has had a poor history with social networking, Google does not have social in their DNA, it feels like they are engineering, technology first in their approach, while Facebook feels more social first than anything else.</p>
<p>However, after seeing this ban I feel what Google should have a horse in the chat app race, and it should be a matrix/element based chat client. Allow me to explain,</p>
<p>Google should embrace an open protocol like Matrix and build a chat client on top of it, yes it’s against their pattern of hoarding data, and usage of open protocol.</p>
<p>But Google was able to win the email, the email protocol is an open protocol, anyone can implement it, anyone can use any client they want, but still Google was able to create the most popular email service available out their, and even monetise it. </p>
<p>Before Google started gmail, services like hotmail only allowed 200mb of storage, I remember Yahoo deleting my email account because I didn’t login for 6 months (I was still schooling at that time, and didn’t use email much), and not to mention Yahoo, and hotmail had atrocious ads on their email service. But google changed all that, they gave a better UI, more storage, and even a better ad experience.</p>
<p>So what makes then incapable of using an open chat protocol and build a great experience around it? With engineers and money to back a project like that Google can build a good chat service around an open chat protocol.</p>
<p>Even ads might not be a thing, Google can still provide enterprise chat service to organisations, powered by their data servers. They can even keep their source closed if they want to, like they are doing with Gmail, but an open source client would be great.</p>
<p>And Google’s backing for a open chat platform will make people interested about it, and even more people will use it just because it’s from Google. People will be able to use their own clients like Element, or another Matrix client, still and users can build a network greater than a centralised chat service, like we use gmail in our mail app to chat with someone else with a different email provider. </p>
<p>And the bottom line is Facebook, Telegram, Signal, and other chat platforms are going on a race without Google, all providing a centralised experience, with the exception of Signal, who is providing a semi-centralised experience. So even if you can’t beat them, why not try to destroy them all with an open chat protocol?</p>

They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote id="2408"><p>“We will move from mobile first to an AI first&nbsp;world.”</p></blockquote><p id="814d">Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/">famously predicted</a> in 2016 that “<em>the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away” </em>and that<em> “over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.”</em></p><p id="6d2f">Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.</p><figure id="179f"><div></div><figcaption>Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deb3">Google vs.&nbsp;Amazon</h3><p id="d2e7">Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1">smash success</a>.

The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.</p><p id="dde3">Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.</p><p id="c590">Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/">far from receptive</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565793939038_266584"><div><p>The human genome is an incredible thing. Six billion letters of DNA – that’s more than two metres of DNA in every single cell – containing all the genes that enable a single cell to grow into a fully-formed, fully functioning person. </p><p>So when the first draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001, researchers around the world were eager to discover exactly how many genes must be packed into our glorious genome.</p><p>The answer was a big surprise.</p><p>Many people thought that it must take at least a hundred thousand genes to make a human – with a sweepstake on offer to the person who made the closest guess to the final number – yet the human genome turns out to contain only 20,000 or so genes (roughly the same number of genes as a fruit fly or nematode worm).</p><p>This seems remarkably low to make an organism with as much dazzling complexity as a human being.  Even more perplexingly, the genes that we do have make up less than two per cent of all that DNA. So what’s the rest?</p><p>To find out, we need to go back in time to 1972.</p><p>That’s when geneticist Susumu Ohno published a paper entitled “So much ‘junk’ DNA in our genome” in an obscure scientific journal, the Brookhaven Symposia in Biology, in which he mused upon a mathematical problem.</p><p>By that point, scientists had already measured how much DNA was present in bacteria and figured out that these little bugs must contain a few thousand genes. They also knew that a single human cell contained at least 750 times as much DNA.</p><p>Ohno did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation – if the number of genes in any genome was directly proportional to the amount of DNA, then humans should have….. three million genes, more or less.</p><p>But, as he pointed out in his paper, ‘lowly lungfish and salamanders’ can have 36 times more DNA in their cells than is present in ours, suggesting that they should have…. A hundred million genes.</p><p>He didn’t believe it. What would a slimy salamander need with all those genes? Therefore, Ohno concluded, the vast majority of the human genome must be junk. And, correspondingly, varying proportions of other organisms’ genomes must be junk too. And once the Human Genome project revealed that the vast majority of our genome doesn’t seem to contain actual genes, it looked like he was right.</p><p>The function of this remaining 98% of the human genome - sometimes called ‘junk DNA’ but more accurately referred to as non-coding DNA – is a hotly debated topic in the world of genetics, fought out within the dignified pages of journals and the more febrile atmosphere of scientific conferences.</p><p>An absolutely massive study published in 2012, known as ENCODE, suggested that around 80% of the human genome was functional – namely, that it did something important for the proper functioning of our cells and bodies. Just under 10 per cent is thought to be control switches responsible for turning genes on and off at the right time and in the right place, while the rest does all manner of things, from producing little pieces of RNA that control gene activity to organising the three-dimensional structure of the DNA inside a cell.</p><p>Others were unconvinced. For example, evolutionary geneticist Chris Ponting suggests that less than 10% of the human genome is functional, based on how much has been strongly preserved through evolutionary time and must therefore be very important.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop we bring in the Onion Test, devised by T. Ryan Gregory and posted on his blog in April 2007. It was later formalised as a scientific paper that he published in 2014, together with Alexander Palazzo.</p><p>Put simply, the Onion Test goes like this.</p><p>The onion in your vegetable drawer has five times more DNA than humans. So if you’re a researcher who thinks that non-coding DNA has a particular function in the genome, can you explain why an onion needs about five times more of it than a human to do the same thing?</p><p>Unpeeling this idea a bit further, Gregory points out that some species of onions have around double the amount of DNA as your regular onions, while others have less than half. Yet they’re pretty much the same and have the same number of genes, so why would they need double or half the amount of non-coding DNA?</p><p>This argument works for all kinds of species, from Ohno’s lowly salamanders with their giant genomes containing roughly the same set of genes as other vertebrates, including humans, to the biggest genome discovered to date, which belongs to the Japanese canopy flower, Paris Japonica, with around 150 time more DNA in its genome than a human.</p><p>Then there’s the poisonous Fugu pufferfish – often eaten (very carefully!) as a delicacy in Japan.  They have remarkably compact genomes, roughly an eighth of the size of our own yet containing almost exactly the same repertoire of genes and very little junk.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with finding function for all the junk in our genome comes from a desire to think that humans are something special in the biological world – certainly more special than an onion.</p><p> But in the words of the grumpy geneticist Dan Graur, who I interviewed for my book Herding Hemingway’s Cats in which I dig into the junk in our genetic trunk,  “Either you have to assume that humans are the pinnacle of creation –that everything is functional and those organisms with more DNA than us have junk DNA but we don’t. Or you have to assume that humans are a regular organism that has junk DNA just like everything else.”</p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/04/onion-test/" target="_blank">T.

      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa9b988f899fba979b8e889382d495889d"><span data-cfemail="7c1d1e090f193c111d080e150452130e1b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

Unfortunately it doesn't. Apparently two signals from the power supply was permanently in low state, BUS DC LO L and BUS AC LO L. These are active low signals and in its' low state the inhibits the clock generation of the main CPU.</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">The schematics above describes the 5V regulator of the H777 power supply. The blue marked area is a current source circuit which is fed by incoming raw DC and which charges a 50uF capacitor which thus creates a nice ramp signal. A resistor ladder circuit and a number of comparators generate the BUS DC LO L, BUS AC LO L and an internal signal which causes the clock signal to the main PWM switch. The voltage over the capacitor never exceeded 20.4 V which was not enough to get the two of the comparators to change polarity. It seems like to much current is consumed from the current source. The capacitor was replaced, but no difference. But the current source was not only connected to the capacitor. It was also connected to the red marked area which is a crow bar circuit. If any of the main switch transistors would fail a 38 V raw DC would be the result on the output. Not very good. Therefore there is a zener diode and a couple of thyristors which fires off if the output voltage exceeded 5.6 VDC. This will also short circuit the current source, effectively stopping all activities in&nbsp; power supply. The problem seemed to be that even under normal circumstances 1.5 mA was consumed by leakage in the thyristor even though hasn't fired. Apparently all thyristors have leakages but not this much.<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Thyristor" height="389" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Change of thyristor to a modern BT145 resulted in a fully functional power supply!</p><p><span>Testing the CPU</span></p><p>All cables were connected and the power was switched on. No smoke leaked anywhere which was a good sign. But the RUN lamp were just flashing briefly. Pressing INIT switch on the console only gave a short blink of the RUN lamp. Not very promising.</p><p>A check with the oscilloscope on the main clock signal of then CPU board showed that is starts up does 8 cycles, the stops for a couple micro seconds then does three more cycles, yet another stop and the three cycles and then nothing.</p><p><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)"></span></p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="8 micro cycles" src="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png"></a></p><br>From the picture above one can deduce that the cycle time is closer to 250 ns rather than 260 ns&nbsp; specified in "Computer Engineering". However using a delay line in a feedback loop may not be that accurate. 4 MHz is a quite impressive speed at least in the mid seventies. </span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Further than this is probably not possible using an oscilloscope only. For that purpose I have gotten this little USB connected tool:<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">But to cover the entire machine with address and data bus one would need four of these.

On the data bus it then receives 165020 which is the to be PC to start execution at after power fail, this is also the first address of the diagnostics program of the M9312. But looking at the address the CPU subsequently outputs on the address bus it is 167020. For some reason bit 10 has became high! Measuring more closely on a bus receiver chip, DS8641 shows that even though the input is at 3.31 V the output is a 3.78 V! This seems to be wrong!</span></p><p><span><span face="verdana, sans-serif">It is alive</span></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b><br></b>This is the little evil thing:<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="DS8641" height="320" src="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" width="319"></a></p><br>Unfortunately DS8641 is not a very common IC.

First I tried XXDP 2.6 which I found an image for on bitsavers:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Unfortunately it required more memory than my machine had so it won't be possible to run this version.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>Ever since .Net v4, in all versions including the last classic .Net version v4.8, the built-in browser detection accessible in the Request.Browser (a HttpBrowserCapabilities object) has a serious flaw which will bite you as soon as your site gets several visitors per minute.</p>



<p>What happens, if you rely on this object, is that users will randomly report having their browser mis-identified.</p>



<p>This post shows why it happens and how to solve it. The issue is also easy to reproduce locally, worth a few fun minutes. If you are so inclined, the problem also lends itself to a DoS attack.</p>



<p>Even though this problem seems only to affect classic .Net (not .Net Core), there is a huge number of running web apps out there, and still new being developed, on this framework.</p>



<p>We have a website relying on some of the later browser features, so we are using browser detection to tell users with older browsers to upgrade, since we absolutely need these features. It works fine for a while, then randomly, users with recent browser versions are suddenly told they need to upgrade. Once this occures it typically lasts for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>To reproduce, create an asp.net project (web forms, MVC, doesn’t really matter) with this code in a .aspx file:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script language="c#" runat="server"&gt;
public void Page_Load(){
    Response.Write(Request.Browser.Browser 
    + " v" + Request.Browser.MajorVersion);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>Visit this page, locally or on a server, and you get for instance <code>Chrome v88</code>. So far, so good.</p>



<p>The browser is classified from the User-Agent HTTP header. My Chrome sends this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36</code></p>



<p>Now, quickly change the <code>Chrome/88</code> in the middle of the string to <code>Chrome/86</code> (or any other number) and retry. For instance in Curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl http://localhost:58571 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36"</code></pre>



<p>Still v88? How strange… Let’s refresh a few times. Still v88. Let’s think for a minute…hmm…refresh again. Gone! Now, at last, it shows v86! </p>



<p>I had to look into the <a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html#https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html,3774a0750f8cc853,references">offending source code</a> from the .Net framework.</p>



<p>What happens is, for performance, the result of the browser classification is stored in a hash-table with the User-Agent string as the key. But not the entire string, no, that would have saved us a lot of headache, no, the key is just the first 64 characters (source line 46).</p>



<p>The Chrome version number is located at position 90 and thus not part of the key at all. To add to the frustration, the cache has a sliding-window (source line 247,304, 369) 1 minute expiry (source line 147). This means: as long as the cache key is read at least once a minute, it stays. Hilarity ensues.</p>



<p>The fix is straight-forward, put this in your <code>web.config</code></p>



<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;browserCaps userAgentCacheKeyLength="512" /&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Why 512? It turns out that .Net caps the User-Agent string at 512 characters  to avoid resource attacks (source line 188). I imagine someone at Microsoft deciding that 512 characters ought to be enough for anybody.</p>



<h2>Denial-of-Service implication</h2>



<p>Without this line in your web.config, your site is also vulnerable to a DoS attack if you, like us, rely on browser identification to enable some functionality. An attacker would wait for low-traffic hours, typically the middle of the night, to issue requests with the first 64 bytes looking like the most commonly used User-Agents on the web, but the rest of the string tweaked with low version numbers or other content to lead the browser capabilities to think “it’s an older browser, sir, but it checks out”.</p>



<p>As long as one request per User Agent is issued per minute, these are permanently mis-identified. An exceptionally low-cost and low-effort DoS attack.</p>

The idea, broadly, is that you’d use the spray first thing in the morning, during the day after social interactions, and then again in the evening — and it would prevent the virus from taking hold and making you ill.</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Simple, cheap, portable. Sort of like cleaning your teeth regularly: prevention rather than cure. Combined with a <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/what-different-types-covid-19-vaccine-are-there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine</a>, particularly for anyone at high risk such as those in healthcare settings, it could put a stop to the whole thing — and might also turn out to be effective on other, less deadly but still annoying, viruses.</p>
<p>But, I hear you ask, what is it? Because if I’m going to squirt something up my nose several times a day, I have questions…</p>

<p>Fair enough. It’s actually, mostly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide</a>, which has the chemical formula NO.</p>
<p>Yes, there are plenty of wordplay options here. The researchers have already jammed the letters NO into their company name, and done the acronym thing, to get <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/sanotize-trials-nasal-spray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray</a> (NONS). If the trials are successful, it’s probably only a matter of time before we get: “Say NO to coronavirus!” marketing. (Any ad agencies reading this, I’m claiming copyright.)</p>
<p>But that aside, unless you’re a chemist you might be thinking about some half-remembered chemical names and frowning at this point. Isn’t that… used in rocket fuel? Or… wait… isn’t that… the nasty smoggy stuff that causes lung problems?</p>
<p>Ah, well, there are several nitrogen oxides. Let me summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>NO is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen monoxide or nitric oxide</a> — that’s what we’re talking about here.</li>
<li>NO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen dioxide</a> — forms when combustion happens in air, and it’s the one that’s brown and smells horrible, and is probably most associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog#Photochemical_smog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photochemical smog&nbsp;</a>(although atmospheric NO has a significant role there, too).</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrous oxide</a>, sometimes just “nitrous” — that’s the one that’s also called laughing gas and is used as an anaesthetic, and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recreationally</a>,” as well as being used to increase the power output of engines.</li>
<li>NO<sub>3</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate_radical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen trioxide</a> — this is a radical, with an unpaired electron. It’s unstable, but it is important in ozone chemistry.</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen tetroxide or dinitrogen tetroxide</a> — this is important because it forms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Structure_and_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an equilibrium with NO<sub>2</sub></a> so the two can be thought of an interconvertible, and also because it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Use_as_a_rocket_propellant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used as a rocket propellent</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other nitrogen oxides</a>, not to mention ions — but let’s not spend all day on this. Nitrogen forms this confusing hodgepodge of oxides because it has five electrons in its outermost shell (it’s in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen-group-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group 15</a> of the periodic table) and because there’s not much difference in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronegativities</a> of oxygen and nitrogen. So essentially, it can share electrons with oxygen to form bonds in a number of different ways to obtain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration#Noble_gas_configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stable, full outer shell</a>.</p>
<p>For any students reading this, I’m sorry. You… pretty much just have to remember these. Yes, I know. That’s why experienced chemists so often use the shorthand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOx </a>— we just can’t be bothered keeping all the names straight. (Okay, before someone shouts at me, actually NOx is handy because we’re often talking about more than one oxide at a time, and it allows us to easily express that.)</p>
<p>Back to NO. It’s a colourless gas, and it has an unpaired electron, which makes it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free radical</a>. And… here we go again. Aren’t we supposed to eat lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antioxidant-</a>rich fruit and vegetables to mop up free radicals? They’re bad, aren’t they?</p>

<p>Yes and no. Free radicals are reactive species which damage cells and can cause illness and ageing. Too much exposure to free radicals causes something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxidative stress</a>, which is definitely bad. But. It turns out that nitrogen oxide is an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_signaling_molecule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signalling molecule</a>, that is, a molecule which is the body uses to send chemical signals from one place to another. In particular, nitrogen oxide “tells” the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Biological_functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smooth muscle around blood vessels to relax</a>, causing those blood vessels to dilate, and increasing blood flow. Viagra (aka <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a>) uses the nitric oxide pathway, and I think we all know what that does, don’t we? Good.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide has also been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce blood pressure</a>, which is generally considered a good thing — <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-pressure-hypotension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to a point, obviously</a>. This is why you can buy lots of so-called <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide supplements</a>, which, since nitrogen oxide is a gas at room temperature, don’t actually contain nitric oxide on its own. Rather, they’re a mixture of amino acids and other things that supposedly help the body to <em>make</em> NO. But it might be cheaper, and healthier, to eat plenty of beetroot or drink beetroot juice, since there’s evidence that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does the same sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dose makes the poison</a>. Too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Occupational_safety_and_health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much nitric oxide is definitely problematic</a>, but administered in the right way and in appropriate doses, it’s extremely safe.</p>
<p>It’s suggested that the nitric oxide in the <a href="https://sanotize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize</a> nasal spray destroys the virus and also helps to stop viral replication within cells. Plus, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocks the receptors</a> that the virus uses to enter cells in the first place. Essentially, it locks the doors and rains down fire on the potential intruders — nice work.</p>
<p>You only need to use the spray occasionally, because developing a COVID-19 infection isn’t instant. First the virus gets into your nose, then it attaches to cells, then it replicates, and <em>then</em> it sheds into your lungs. There are timescales involved here — so long as the spray is used every so often it should do the trick.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that this should, theoretically, work on other strains — where the current vaccines may not. So it could provide a very important stopgap when vaccination isn’t immediately available.</p>

<p>All sounds fabulous, doesn’t it? It might be, but, we’re in the early stages with this. Clinical trials <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have now started in the UK</a>, are already in <a href="https://sanotize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SaNOtize_HC_USU_release_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase II in Canada</a> and have been approved to start in the USA. Researchers are hopeful, but we need to wait for the evidence.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, <a href="https://twitter.com/chronicleflask/status/1283015334732103682" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wear a mask</a>, <a href="https://chronicleflask.com/2020/03/26/cleaning-chemistry-awesome-soap/">wash your hands,</a> and take a vaccine if you’re offered one. Stay safe out there!</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Your stuff needs a home (yes, even in the "serverless" world. LOL). My personal preferences are <a href="https://azure.com/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23">Digital Ocean</a> <em>(affiliate link)</em>, or <a href="https://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.</p><p>Another honorable mention here is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.</p><h3 id="the-virtual-machines">The Virtual Machines</h3><p>For those side projects and many enterprise applications, <strong>scale is not an issue</strong>. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/">Scaleway's Developer line of servers</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack? When scale is not an issue then you don't need Kubernetes.</strong></em></p><h3 id="docker-just-plain-docker-">Docker. Just plain Docker.</h3><p>I do not rely on the OS vendor (Ubuntu) to make sure that I run the latest Docker on new VMs. Therefore I use the nice little <code>curl|bash</code> technique.</p><pre><code>curl -s https://get.docker.com | sudo bash</code></pre><p>This cure one-liner will get the best and most recent version for your machine running.</p><h3 id="traefik-for-reverse-proxy">Traefik for Reverse Proxy</h3><p>Traefik has been a God-send since I found it. Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:</p><ol><li>Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.</li><li>Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.</li></ol><p>My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Another note here: I have already <a href="https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/" title="Traefik 2 production ready configurations">published my production configuations for Traefik</a> here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="postgres-for-database">Postgres for Database</h3><p>Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down. I usually attach one of these containers to a project that needs it without any difficulty. I simply spin up the container, bind the ports, and then bind the data volume to my host disk. Done and Done.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="dockercomposeyml">docker-compose.yml</h3>
<pre><code>version: '3.1'

services:

  db:

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="dockerized-django-for-web">Dockerized Django for Web</h3><p>Docker deploys nicely in a container, and I have been doing it for a few years now. The benefits of matching your development environment to your production one cannot be overstated, and I have Docker to thank for that.</p><p>Edit: 2021, I've got a reference Django project up that I use as my template for new projects: <a href="https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation">https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation</a></p><h3 id="django-commands-for-asynchronous-tasks">Django commands for Asynchronous tasks</h3><p>Also, for asynchronous tasks I simply use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-management-commands/">custom Django commands</a> which are a part of the standard framework. The pattern here is a simple <code>while</code> loop with a <code>sleep()</code> period. It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing. &nbsp;</p><p>Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.</p><p>That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots</p><h3 id="intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity">IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?</h3><p>I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (<em>yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery</em>) to make parts of my applications <em>feel</em> like single-page-apps but not really.</p><p>IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school "Ajax" (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.</p><p>I strongly suggest you check it out: <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Learn more about IntercoolerJS</a></p><p>Edit 2021: The creator has released <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, the successor to IntercoolerJS.</p><h3 id="sentry-to-catch-production-errors">Sentry to catch production errors</h3><p>I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:</p><ol><li>Open source-ish (<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">relicensed here</a>), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.</li><li>Easy few lines added to your <code>settings.py</code> file in Django and that is it.</li><li>Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.</li></ol><p>Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.</p><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Check out Sentry here</a>.</p><h3 id="bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd">Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD</h3><p>Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.</p><p>There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files. </p><p>Using the <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Checkout Bitbucket here</a>.</p><h3 id="zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane">ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane</h3><p>Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have. &nbsp;Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.</p><p>Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.</p><p>Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.</p><p>The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it "just works" as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.</p><p>Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One way that some states are combating emissions is by selling a fixed number of pollution permits to power plants. Currently, governments reduce the number or pollution permits by 3% each year to force power plants to find cleaner ways to operate (more efficient power plants, renewable energy, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individuals to help lower emissions faster because permits Kotoo buys become unavailable to power plants, forcing them to reduce their emissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine the government has a concert venue and it’s throwing a renewable energy benefit concert by a band called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). All the power plants have attended the CO2 concert for decades. Some people want power plants to attend a concert by a new band called Renewable Energy so they buy and shred the tickets to the CO2 concert so that the power plants can’t attend. Since the power plants can’t do without music - they go to the Renewable Energy concert instead. They learn that Renewable Energy is so good (it’s cheaper!) that they never go back to the Carbon Dioxide concert. Eventually all the seats in Carbon Dioxide concert are empty so the band stops playing and shredding tickets is no longer needed.</span></p>

<p><span>While the Renewable Energy fans could just go to the RE concert - buying out the CO2 tickets still builds renewable energy since it’s a benefit concert while also preventing CO2 from being emitted. It ultimately converts old CO2 enthusiasts rather than waiting for Renewable Energy to become so dominant it overtakes CO2.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><a href="https://info.kotoo.earth/hc/en-us/articles/360058439833" target="_self">Why powerplants are the key to climate change</a></span></p>


<p><strong>Details</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Another way to think about emissions is by thinking about fuel because emissions are directly related to fuel burned.* But some powerplants get more electricity out of a given amount of fuel - just like how different cars go different distances on the same amount of fuel. So we can think about power plant emissions just like how you might think about gas mileage - some go further than others but the ones that are more efficient are more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s say that there was a fixed amount of fuel available every three months. Every three months, everyone shows up to buy the fuel but there's only a set amount available. Since people want more fuel than is available - the government sets up an auction and sells it to the highest bidders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>People who have less efficient, and therefore cheaper, equipment have more money for fuel but they need to buy more of it. And those that have more efficient equipment need less and may save money even though their equipment cost them more up front.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over time, the amount of fuel available decreases so if the amount of fuel people require doesn’t change, then the fuel gets more expensive. However, the more expensive the fuel, the more it makes sense for people to upgrade to more efficient machines to save money on fuel or run the risk of not being able to operate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The beauty of this is that everyone can choose an upgrade system that works for them on a time horizon that makes sense for them regardless of what type of fuel they need. And there is more than one option, here are a few:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>they can stop making electricity</span></li>
<li><span>they can operate their power plant more efficiently with the fuel they have</span></li>
<li><span>they can pay for upgrades to their plant to make their fuel go further. This costs money up front but saves them money when they have to buy less fuel.</span></li>
<li><span>they can build a fuel free power plant (aka renewable energy) which also costs money but saves them money on fuel</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Lastly, while all this is happening, the money raised from the auction are spent building new fuel free powerplants and helping people use less electricity - so those that need the fuel are also building a future in which no fuel is needed.</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individual people to drive this change faster by showing up to the auction and buying permits that we don’t plan to use. This makes less fuel available and increases the price. As prices increase, power plants will save more and more money by making one of the 4 choices above. And as prices increase more and more money is available to build fuel free powerplants.</span></p>

<p><span>*For a certain type of fuel, it is mostly true that a gallon of that fuel will always make the same emissions. Combustion nerds (aka the author) know that it is possible to burn fuels in dirty and clean ways but the analogy holds because technology to burn fuel more cleanly usually costs more money because it is newer. It is also true that different types of fuels create dramatically different amounts of emissions (coal is twice as dirty as natural gas) but more fuel always means more emissions and outside of this analogy, the price is set by emissions so it’s robust to how fuel is burned and what type of fuel is being burned</span></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>The first batch of the repaired Raspberry Pi’s have been sold! If you missed out on this, don’t worry! There are more to come as I repair them. </p><p>I sold a total of 27 Raspberry Pi’s, 3 people cancelled their orders as they somehow thought these were Raspberry Pi 4’s?! I will relist these  during the week along with a few freshly repaired devices with upgraded SD card slots.</p></div>



<p>After ebay fees and P&amp;P the total was £400 which I have donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation as can be seen below, more will be coming in a future post to show what this money will go towards. </p>

<h2>Replacing and Upgrading Damaged SD Card Slots</h2>



<p>A large amount of the Pi’s had damaged SD card slots, the original slots are made of plastic which was fairly brittle in 2012 when they were released and they really haven’t aged well! </p>

<p>As can be seen on this image the slots have crumbled meaning they no longer hold an SD card. I managed to source the original SD card slots although the seller wanted £2 each for them which just wasn’t worthwhile. I managed to source upgraded metal SD card slots for £0.14p each on aliexpress here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html</a></p>



<div><p>Removing the old SD card slot was easy, using a pair of snips I cut as much of the plastic away as possible leaving only the pins to remove. I did this using a soldering iron rather than hot air. </p><p>Installing the new SD card slot was equally as easy, the new slots don’t have the SD card detection switch built in meaning that the detection pads need to be bridged with Solder as can be seen in the image below:</p></div>

<p>Overall this was a very easy repair, I will post some detailed guides or maybe even videos on the repairs once I get through some of the backlog so don’t worry if this repair wasn’t in-depth enough for you. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>This SD card slots arriving from China allows me to repair a further 30 of the damaged Raspberry Pi’s which will be for sale soon – Remember that the profits from these sales goes to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>The pace will be slowing down a little once this batch of repairs are complete as I have some upcoming hardware reviews I need to prepare for which will be showcased in future posts. </p></div>



<p>As always please leave a comment and share your thoughts on the repair process. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I will attempt to convince you that 'awk' is a great tool to learn for solving one-off text manipulation and analysis problems. &nbsp;After learning awk, you'll immediately be accepted into the "10x engineer's club" and be cured of your imposter syndrome. &nbsp;From now on, your typical team meetings will go something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: &nbsp;"Hey, let's make a well-informed data-driven decision about which product to focus on selling. &nbsp;Do we have any numbers on which product(s) make the most profit in total?".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All 1x Engineers in the room</strong> (<em>speaking together in a synchronized monotone voice</em>): "Nah, we'd have to write an ETL job to import the .csv files and write many Java Classes. &nbsp;It would take at least 4 weeks.".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>: "I just spent 30 seconds writing an awk one-liner to calculate the profit for each product. &nbsp;Here is the list sorted from highest to lowest."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: "Thanks. I value your expertise, and have a great appreciation for your contributions to this company."</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awk is a command-line tool that can be used for processing text files line by line. &nbsp;The 'awk' command could be compared to the 'grep' or 'sed' commands. &nbsp;In fact, many of the basic use cases for 'grep' or 'sed' can actually be solved in a nearly identically way by awk. &nbsp;Therefore, an important question worth asking is: &nbsp;If some of the use cases for awk are replicated by 'sed' or 'grep', why would you ever want to use awk? &nbsp;The answer is that awk is a fully-fledged programming language. &nbsp;The 'grep' command is specifically designed for searching, and the 'sed' command is specifically designed for replacing. &nbsp;Awk is able to do both at the same time, but even more importantly, 'awk' gives you access to things that a 'real' programming language has, like math or logic operations, formatted printing, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you may wonder, if 'awk' acts like a 'real' programming language, why not stick to another established 'real' programming language like Python? &nbsp;The answer is that 'awk' was specifically designed to serve in this middle-ground area of 'sort of command-line' and 'sort of programming language'. &nbsp;It's definitely possible to insert Python into the middle of a shell pipe (with python -c), but it quickly gets pretty messy. &nbsp;Awk, on the other hand, is much better suited for the task, and it includes a <em>lot</em> of default assumptions that make it very terse (but also intimidating to beginners).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a specific example of a problem that 'awk' can solve, but 'grep' or 'sed' can't. &nbsp;The following file 'temps.csv' contains a list of temperature values:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
78.1	F
23.1	C
25.7	C
76.3	F
77.3	F
24.2	C
79.3	F
27.9	C
75.1	F
25.9	C
79.0	F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these temperature values are stated in Celsius, while other are stated in Fahrenheit. &nbsp;In a case like this, you might want to normalize these values to use the same unit so that you can graph them, or compute an average etc. &nbsp;You can do exactly that with the following 'awk' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6111	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6111	C
25.1667	C
24.2	C
26.2778	C
27.9	C
23.9444	C
25.9	C
26.1111	C
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how this awk command works, let's work on re-building it from scratch. &nbsp;Here is a much simpler awk command that shows how it will automatically parse and split up the two columns for us so we can work with them separately:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First column item: temp Second column item: unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the columns in the original file are separated by white-space, the awk command will automatically split up the 'columns' and make them accessible inside the '$1' and '$2' variables. &nbsp;As you can see, our last example simply prints these out without doing any kind of logic on them. &nbsp;This stuff inside the {...} characters is called the 'action' statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default (on my machine), awk will attempt to run every single 'action' statement on every line of the file. &nbsp;In our case, we don't actually want our special print statement to run on every line of the file. &nbsp;In particular, we don't want to make changes to the first line, since it's just the list of column headers. &nbsp;We can add the requirement that our special print statement should only occur on 'record number greater than 1', or 'NR&gt;1'. &nbsp;'NR' stands for Number of Record:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this won't print out the header <em>at all</em>. &nbsp;To print out the first line without changing it, we can add the statement 'NR==1;' to our awk command. &nbsp;The 'NR==1' part means "Only do this on the record #1", and the ';' part is an empty statement which defaults to printing out the current line without changing it:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the output from this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we're almost back at the full command that we started off with. &nbsp;We just need to add the temperature normalizing part. &nbsp;The logic/math for normalizing to Celsius units would look something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>if<span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span>-32<span>)</span> / <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> 
<span>}</span><span>else</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>$1</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, we could re-write this using the ternary operator as the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span> ? </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span><span>-32</span><span>)</span><span> / </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span> : </span><span>$1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting this back into our print statement gives us the full solution that was introduced previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final output that was shown before was not very nice to look at since most of the converted Fahrenheit values had way too many digits after the decimal place. &nbsp;To fix this, we can use the more sophisticated 'printf' to do a formatted print operation and make the output look even better:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6	C
25.2	C
24.2	C
26.3	C
27.9	C
23.9	C
25.9	C
26.1	C
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to split up the columns in each line, awk needs to know what the 'field separator' is. &nbsp;The default field separator can be different on different systems or different implementations of awk, but you can often assume it to be 'white-space' for some definition of white-space. &nbsp;You can also explicitly specify it using the '-F' flag. &nbsp;For example, here is the same awk command we just used, but using a comma for the field separator:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f,%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here it is again with an explicitly specified tab character:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field separators can even be regular expressions:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>col1-481-col2-981-col3</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>-[0-9]{3}-</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>{print $1" "$2" "$3}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>col1 col2 col3
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>False.</strong> &nbsp;Awk is extremely <em>easy</em> to learn. &nbsp;The reason that it <em>seems</em> so hard to learn is because awk has so many implicit defaults, but nobody ever seems to explain this fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can think of every awk command as a collection of 'if statements' that run against every line in the file. &nbsp;The syntax of every awk command looks pretty close to something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>if(PATTERN1){...print something...} if(PATTERN2){...print something...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the one exception beging that the 'if' keyword is never actually written out since it's assumed to be there by default (if you do write it, you'll get a syntax error). &nbsp;Therefore, the overall syntax for every awk command (that doesn't rely on defaults) is pretty much this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>(PATTERN1){...Action 1...} (PATTERN2){...Action 2...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above command, the 'PATTERN1' or 'PATTERN2' is the trigger you want to cause the stuff inside the '{' '}' characters to actually execute. &nbsp;Here are a few examples of commonly used patterns:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==2){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>

<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>there</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>($0 ~ /l/){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>hello
world
</pre></code>


<code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>acb def</span><span>\n</span><span>something else</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(length($1) &gt; 5){print $2}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>else
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provides some context on what you can do in the 'pattern' part, but what about the 'action' part? &nbsp;Well, you can use your imagination since that's where awk becomes a fully fledged programming language. &nbsp;Here is an example awk command that will iterate over every character in the 3rd column on the 4th line and print out each character on a different line:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a a a</span><span>\n</span><span>a a hello_there a</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==4){</span>
<span>  n_chrs = split($3, individual_characters, "")</span>
<span>  for (i=1; i &lt;= n_chrs; i++){</span>
<span>    printf("Here is character number %d : %c\n", i, …</span></pre></code></p></div></div></div>

			<p><em>In this piece, author Jessica Flanigan makes the case that UBI is a better solution than raising the minimum wage, because UBI reaches all workers, paid and unpaid, and would also provide all workers the bargaining power to better choose where and how they want to work. — Scott Santens, Editor, BIT</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">latest jobs report from the BLS</a> reports a sudden acceleration of an ongoing trend of job growth, and unemployment in the US is now around 3.7 percent. Despite these impressive job numbers, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/04/if-real-wages-arent-rising-how-is-household-income-going-up/?source=post_page---------------------------">real wages remain low</a> for American workers. Perhaps in light of this, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democratic-push-to-raise-minimum-wage-opens-rift-over-amount-of-hike/2019/04/12/05711400-5d2d-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html?utm_term=.70a79b170fa0&amp;source=post_page---------------------------">Raise the Wage Act</a> this week, which reflects the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_$15?source=post_page---------------------------">Fight for $15</a> campaign: increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The idea polls well. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">majority of voters</a> support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour as well. And most <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-embrace-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a>, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, support a $15 federal minimum wage too.</p>
<p>And it may seem that conditions are perfect for changing the federal minimum wage — unemployment is low, and the idea has a lot of support. But it’s worth thinking about proposals for a $15 federal minimum wage not only in light of Americans’ current economic circumstances but also in light of projected changes to the workforce going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>A higher minimum wage may benefit people who have jobs, but it doesn’t make life easier for people who aren’t workers. This is what makes the idea of a Universal Basic Income or Negative Income Tax a more promising route. Essentially, if we are interested in helping those most in need, we should focus on policies that put cash in all people’s pockets instead of just the pockets of hourly employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the advantage of these programs over a $15 minimum wage is that they benefit all citizens and do not disproportionately benefit workers and burden employers. And unlike other costly redistributive policies such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, UBI is better suited to reflect each person’s distinctive circumstances, preferences, and personal values. Below, I outline several reasons why more people should consider the UBI as a viable public policy.</p>
<p>Considering the UBI over the Fight for $15</p>
<p>Overall, the UBI does not rely on maintaining our current economic order in the way that policies that focus on benefiting workers do. This is an advantage because the economy is very likely going to change radically in the next century. Though today’s workers are <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-05-49-Of-Workers-Believe-AI-And-Automation-Will-Have-No-Impact-On-Their-Job?source=post_page---------------------------">not very concerned</a> about automation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17524822/robot-automation-job-threat-what-happens-next?source=post_page---------------------------">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/06/automation-destroy-millions-jobs-change?source=post_page---------------------------">policy experts</a> argue that they should be.</p>
<p>Even if new technology does not cause significant job losses, workplace transformations associated with new technology are likely to have significant <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/?source=post_page---------------------------">political and economic consequences</a>. Tying the provision of public benefits to participation in the workforce needlessly raises the stakes of any policy that could change the composition of the workforce, and therefore increases the political and economic risks associated with automation. Moreover, the UBI doesn’t limit its benefits to people who are engaged in paid employment. This has four benefits that a higher minimum wage does not.</p>
<p>First, a UBI would benefit people who do valuable unpaid labor, such as childcare and eldercare, as well as people who are employees.</p>
<p>Second, a UBI would not interfere with workers’ and employers’ freedom to set the terms and conditions of their labor. If it is possible to benefit low-income Americans without restricting their freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment relationships, officials should favor the less restrictive policies.</p>
<p>Third, a UBI would not tie people to their employers. This means that a basic income would potentially enable more economic mobility, enhance workers’ bargaining power, and enable people to stop working if they need to leave the workforce due to disability or caregiving obligations.</p>
<p>Fourth, policies that do not tie assistance to employment would not disproportionately burden employers. The debate over minimum wage increases is often framed as if employers are failing to benefit workers sufficiently. But low-wage work often helps low-skill workers more than anyone else. Without these employment opportunities, they would be even less capable of meeting their basic needs. If the justification for a higher minimum wage is that everyone should be able to support themselves, why should employers bear the full cost of meeting that goal? In contrast, a basic income enables citizens to share the cost of supporting a social safety net rather than treating employers as the only way to achieve it.</p>
<p>A significant benefit of a UBI, in contrast to other recent entitlement reforms such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, is that it doesn’t tell people how to spend it. People have different values, but in-kind benefits assume that all people have the same interest in healthcare or being debt-free. This may be broadly true, but there are tradeoffs. Given the cost of these programs, it’s fair to ask whether people would be better off if we just gave them the money instead. But evidence from developing countries suggests that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/let-them-eat-cash.html?source=post_page---------------------------"> cash does help people better than alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it, the main challenge to a Basic Income proposal is affordability. Estimates vary, and some argue that a UBI would be <a href="https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/resource/universal-basic-income-proposals-in-light-of-ilo-standards-key-issues-and-global-costing-ess-%e2%94%80-working-paper-no-62/?source=post_page---------------------------">catastrophically</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/05/23/basically-unaffordable?source=post_page---------------------------">expensive</a> whereas others suggest that it is “<a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/basic-income-is-easily-affordable-8389995528b3?source=post_page---------------------------">easily affordable</a>.” Plausibly, while a UBI would save on administrative costs, it does seem that funding sustainable UBI could require making some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/04/of-course-we-can-afford-a-universal-basic-income-do-we-want-one-though/?source=post_page---------------------------#50c7d99f323c">hard choices</a> about other social programs such as healthcare, education, and defense.</p>
<p>The UBI and Social Security</p>
<p>UBI may seem like a radical idea, but there’s a precedent for it in America. Elderly people already receive what is effectively a basic income through Social Security. Some of them continue to work, while others use their basic income (and retirement savings) to pay their bills so that they can focus on spending time with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies. Some elderly people are disabled, and Social Security enables them to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>Yet older voters <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/435278-poll-most-voters-oppose-a-universal-basic-income-programs?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/375587-gallup-poll-americans-split-on-giving-a-universal-basic-income-to-workers?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> Universal Basic Income proposals while younger voters are in favor of it. Even more curiously, older voters <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://socialsecurityworks.org/2019/03/26/social-security-polling/?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> cuts to their basic income, Social Security. The difficult position for older voters is that the reasons for opposing a basic income are also reasons to oppose social security. And those who support Social Security should support a basic income as well. Those who oppose the UBI should rethink their support for Social Security. If anything, the case for a UBI is stronger than the case for Social Security because as it is currently structured, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Social Security may be a slightly regressive policy</a>, in part <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mortality-social-security-20180912-story.html?source=post_page---------------------------">because wealthy people live longer.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2014/09/political-authority-and-the-basic-income/?source=post_page---------------------------">Elsewhere</a>, I have argued in favor of a basic income because it is a kind of compensation for the injustices associated with our existing property system. In contrast, minimum wage requirements only compound the injustices of the current system by doubling down on the idea that elevates paid employment over other kinds of potentially valuable work, discourages opportunities for low-skilled workers, and leaves non-workers out of the social safety net. A basic income is more respectful of people’s freedom, more sensitive to recipients’ values, and better suited for a rapidly changing economy.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The original version of this post highlighted the disadvantages of using a fixed key frame interval. I’ve since learned that this problem can be avoided using intra refresh in the H264 stream.</p>



<p>Streaming media. specifically video, is a fickle beast. This will be a short post, but it will cover everything you need to know to stream media using FFmpeg to WebRTC clients. This technique has many applications, such as streaming synchronized videos to users. </p>



<h2>Setting up the input</h2>



<p>Before inputting a file into FFmpeg, we need to pass a few flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \</code></pre>



<p>These flags set the log level to info, generate pts if they’re missing, and sets up the protocols we can use. Next we need to provide the input to FFmpeg.</p>



<pre><code>-i in.mp4</code></pre>



<p>In this example, a file name <code>in.mp4</code> is used, but a http(s) URL could also be used. This command starts playback at the beginning of the input file. If you want to start playback in the middle of the input file, then you can add the <code>-ss &lt;time in secs&gt;</code> flag <strong>before</strong> <code>-i</code>.</p>



<h2>Video arguments</h2>



<p>Now the video needs to be converted to an appropriate format for streaming. The format is specific to the application, but common codecs are H264, VP8, and VP9. This example uses H264 due to its ubiquitous support.</p>



<pre><code>-vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
-map 0:v:0 \
-c:v libx264 \
-x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
-threads 3 \
-profile:v baseline \
-level:v 3.1 \
-pix_fmt yuv420p \
-tune zerolatency \
-minrate 500K \
-maxrate 1.3M \
-bufsize 500K \</code></pre>



<p><code>-vf</code> specifies the video filters to apply. Here, two filters are applied. The first is <code>realtime</code>, which causes playback to happen in real time, which is necessary for streaming. This filter is similar to the <code>-re</code> flag, but works much better with the start time flag (<code>-ss</code>). The second filter scales the video width to a maximum of 1280 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is important to keep the bitrate appropriate for real time streaming. </p>



<p>The <code>intra-refresh</code> parameter allows users to consume the video stream mid-way through by providing enough metadata over multiple inter frames to decode a full frame. The <code>fast-pskip=0</code>is required for <code>intra-refresh</code> to work if the source video files contains very few frames, which can happen if the video displays static images for long periods of time. There may be another way around this, but I’m not aware of it. </p>



<p>Another important parameter is the <code>-threads 3</code> flag. FFmpeg will use many threads by the default. Normally, this is good because it produces the final result as fast as possible. For real time encoding, however, using a large number of threads has some overhead that can slow down real time output. Using many threads is also a bad idea if you’re running multiple instances of FFmpeg concurrently.</p>



<p>The next two parametrs <code>-profile:v</code> and <code>-level:v</code> specify the profile and level to use for the encoding. These are specific to H264. WebRTC clients can only decode certain profiles and levels, so these need to match the specific configuration of the application. These roughly correspond to the profile-level-id of <code>42e01f</code>. </p>



<p>The pixel format is set to <code>yuv420p</code> using the <code>-pix_fmt</code> flag. This is required as this is the only pixel format supported by WebRTC. <code>-tune zerolatency</code> tunes the encoder for low latency streaming.</p>



<p>Next up are the bitrate parameters. When streaming media, the bitrate should be as low as possible while maintaining the desired quality. This ensures all clients can consume the video in real time. Omitting the <code>-minrate</code> parameter can cause FFmpeg to produce output with an unnecessarily high bitrate. Setting the <code>-maxrate</code> is equally important. A DSL connection can only pull down around 2 Mbps. In order for users to watch the video, they must be able to download it in real time, so the maximum bitrate has to be lower than the slowest connection among your users. Another consideration is that the streaming video might not be the only bandwidth consuming task on the user’s network.</p>



<h2>Audio arguments</h2>



<p>The audio arguments are much simpler.</p>



<pre><code>-af arealtime \
-map 0:a:0 \
-c:a libopus \
-ab 128k \
-ac 2 \
-ar 48000 \</code></pre>



<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>arealtime</code> filter is used, which is similar to the <code>realtime</code> filter, but for audio.</p>



<h2>Output arguments</h2>



<p>The output can be piped to an RTP endpoint using the <code>tee</code> psuedomuxer. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not support multiplexing over RTP, so you’ll need two separate RTP endpoints, one for the video stream and one for the audio stream. </p>



<pre><code>-f tee \
[select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;audio-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;audio-ip&gt;:&lt;audio-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;audio-rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;video-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;video-ip&gt;:&lt;video-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;video-rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now you can stream video over RTP! The full command is</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \
  -i in.mp4
  -vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
  -map 0:v:0 \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
  -threads 3 \
  -profile:v baseline \
  -level:v 3.1 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -tune zerolatency \
  -minrate 500K \
  -maxrate 1.3M \
  -bufsize 500K \
  -af arealtime \
  -map 0:a:0 \
  -c:a libopus \
  -ab 128k \
  -ac 2 \
  -ar 48000 \
  -f tee \
  [select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg" alt="A picture of my home office."></a></p>

<p>As part of that switch, I needed to configure parts of my Linux environment (which was originally
stock Ubuntu, but is now <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> with a heavily customized userspace) to function
correctly on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>This post will document most of the changes I applied. Hopefully others will find it useful for
their own HiDPI setups.</p>

<h2 id="90-of-the-way-x11-resources">90% of the way: X11 resources</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a (nearly) one-stop location for configuring the default DPI for
X11 applications: the <code>Xft.dpi</code> setting.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to configure X11, but I personally use an <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Xft</span>.<span>dpi</span>: <span>163</span>
<span># not used directly; more on this later
</span><span>janus</span>.<span>fractionalDpi</span>: <span>1</span>.<span>63</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>163</code> and <code>1.63</code> are my DPI and its fractional form, respectively.</p>

<p>On my system, <code>~/.Xresources</code> gets loaded into the X resource database automatically by some
magic that I never configured. However, if yours doesn’t (or you use a different resource file),
you can always tell i3 (or your WM of choice) to load it explicitly with <code>xrdb</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> xrdb ~/.Xresources
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With just this, about 90% of my applications (including GTK based ones, like Firefox) scaled
correctly and were usable without any font or custom scaling changes. Not bad for a single line!</p>

<h2 id="per-application-fixes">Per-application fixes</h2>

<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify’s Linux application is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/">CEF</a>
shell. For reasons that are unclear to me, it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code> while normal Chromium
(via <code>snap</code> or <code>apt</code>) does.</p>

<p>To get it to scale correctly, I needed to pass <code>--force-device-scale-factor=1.63</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>spotify <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span>1.63
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it became clear to me that the fractional form of my DPI would be nice to set in
as few places as possible, to avoid duplication. Hence the <code>janus.fractionalDpi</code><sup id="fnref:hostname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hostname">1</a></sup> above,
and
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spotify">this little <code>spotify</code> wrapper</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span># see the actual script linked above for some program-finding stupidity</span>
<span>real_spotify</span><span>=</span>/snap/bin/spotify

<span># grab the correct fractional DPI from the X resource DB</span>
<span>dpi</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>xrdb <span>-query</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>hostname</span><span>)</span><span>.fractionalDpi"</span> | <span>cut</span> <span>-f2</span><span>)</span>
<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>real_spotify</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dpi</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> as my primary editor. As far as I can tell
it doesn’t use either GTK or Qt (or any other open-source GUI framework), which is probably why
it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code>.</p>

<p>To get Sublime Text to scale correctly, I had to set <code>ui_scale</code> to the appropriate fractional DPI
in my user preferences (<code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Preferences.sublime-settings</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"ui_scale"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.63</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some lingering pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sublime Text’s input is noticeably laggy when the UI is scaled. It’s not so laggy as to be
unusable, but it’s definitely noticeable even if you aren’t sensitive to latencies (I’m not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousing between Sublime Text and other windows causes noticeable stutter/hiccuping during
video playback. I haven’t dug into the X events yet, but my guess is that it’s got some kind
of pessimistic (and serial) <code>XFlush</code> or <code>XSync</code> that takes a decent bit of time on a larger window
buffer. It doesn’t happen with smaller windows (either floating or fixed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-broadcaster-software-obs">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</h3>

<p>I haven’t used it recently, but I used to use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to stream myself
working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When I switched monitors, I noticed that the embedded preview window for my scenes had stopped
working. OBS <em>itself</em> was still fully functional and the <em>separate</em> preview window still worked,
but the embedded preview was always filled in with black pixels.</p>

<p>After a decent bit of hair-pulling, I found a Qt environment variable that “fixed” it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR</span><span>=</span>0 obs
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I still don’t understand why that fixed it, but now my OBS is scaled correctly <strong>and</strong> has a
functional preview embed. I also posted this fix to the
<a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/bug-fix-black-preview-embed-window-on-linux-w-hidpi-monitors.135041/">OBS forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feh">feh</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh"><code>feh</code></a> as my image viewer. By default, it seems to use
a bitmap font that’s incredibly small on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>To fix it, I modified by default theme to use my distro supplied Ubuntu Roman-face font in
14pt.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/feh/themes</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>feh <span>--borderless</span> <span>--scale-down</span> <span>--conversion-timeout</span> 1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--fontpath</span> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu <span>--menu-font</span> Ubuntu-R/14
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I haven’t figured out: when I open some higher-resolution images in <code>feh</code>, they’re
occasionally shifted to the right with transparent pixels where some of the image should be.
Clicking and dragging inside the image window causes it to re-render correctly, as does
resizing the window. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.</p>

<h3 id="dunst">dunst</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://dunst-project.org/"><code>dunst</code></a> as my notification daemon.</p>

<p>It didn’t <strong>need</strong> any HiDPI-specific configuration, but I took the opportunity to make its
notifications slightly more readable on these newer displays.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code> (among many other settings):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>monitor</span> = <span>0</span>
<span>follow</span> = <span>mouse</span>
<span>geometry</span> = <span>"600x120-30+20"</span>
<span>icon_position</span> = <span>left</span>
<span>max_icon_size</span> = <span>64</span>
<span>icon_path</span> = /<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>status</span>/:/<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>devices</span>/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>

<h3 id="mouse-acceleration">Mouse acceleration</h3>

<p>My new displays are individually larger and significantly more dense than my previous ones, making
my mouse feel sluggish. I originally configured my mouse acceleration with
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xset.1.html"><code>xset</code></a>, but at some point my
system switched to <code>libinput</code> and <code>libinput</code>-based inputs apparently don’t respect <code>xset</code> anymore
(or never did?). Sigh.</p>

<p>The fix is to use <code>xinput</code> instead, with either symbolic names or XIDs for the device and setting
being controlled. For example, this is what I use to set my mouse’s acceleration to the maximum
(<code>1.0</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>xinput <span>--set-prop</span> <span>"USB Optical Mouse"</span> <span>"libinput Accel Speed"</span> 1.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your device and setting names may vary, of course, as may their value ranges (mine happened to be
<code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>). You can use <code>xinput</code> on its own to list the names and XIDs of your devices;
<code>xinput list-props &lt;XID-or-name&gt;</code> can be used to dump a particular device’s properties and
their current values.</p>

<h3 id="i3-workspaces">i3 workspaces</h3>

<p>I use i3’s <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html">layout saving/restoring</a> functionality
to automatically load all of my workspaces and their applications when I log in.</p>

<p>Those layouts are stored in a (relaxed) JSON format via <code>i3-save-tree</code>, and contain hardcoded
coordinates. To update them for my new monitors, I just had to recreate each of my workspaces
once on my new monitors and dump them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># for each workspace (1A, 1B, ...)</span>
i3-save-tree <span>--workspace</span> 1A <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/i3/workspaces/1A.json
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and then fix them up manually to enable the appropriate application swallowing rules.</p>

<h3 id="hexchat">HexChat</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat</a> for IRC.</p>

<p>HexChat’s config file includes individual offsets for each of the sub-panes in the GUI,
which means that it breaks badly if you change your monitor dimensions. I couldn’t figure out
how to fix them, so I ended up deleting my main <code>~/.config/hexchat/hexchat.conf</code> entirely and
recreating my preferred layout from memory. YMMV.</p>

<h3 id="system-icons">System icons</h3>

<p>I didn’t have to make any changes with respect to my system icon sizes, which is <em>probably</em>
because I actually see very few icons during normal i3 usage. Once again, YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Switching from a set of 3 FHD monitors to two 4K HiDPI ones was <em>relatively</em> painless. The
problems that I had, unsurprisingly, were primarily with the few proprietary applications I use
needing to be spoon-feed DPI information in their own ways — every other problem was
either a bug (OBS + Qt) or a matter of more general reconfiguration.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" role="main"><p>A reflection on Ram Dass’ 1971 classic, <em>Be Here Now</em>, and the book’s connection to information and our state of being.</p>

<p>Like many who walk the hallways of elite institutions, Ram Dass’ life intersected with influential mid-century thinkers and doers. His most famous collaborator might have been Timothy Leary in the early 1960s. Their landmark studies of psychedelic drugs lead to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.</p>
<p>Ram Dass’ association with David Padwa is of more immediate interest to me. Padwa established a company called Basic Systems and became a millionaire by the time he met the young author in the late 1960s.<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>From David Padwa’s <a href="http://www.cuke.com/people/padwa.htm">Curriculum Vitae</a>: “1960-1965. Founder and CEO of Basic Systems Inc.&nbsp;Principal offices in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Pasadena, and Washington, DC. Firm specialized in educational and curricular technologies as well as the provision of systems integration services in education and training markets. In 1964 Xerox Corporation acquired Basic Systems; continued as division executive at Xerox and Director of Planning for educational markets.”</span></span> Basic Systems automated employee training and student education, often integrating into an institution’s existing computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company caught the eye of Xerox Corporation and was soon acquired. It fit nicely with Xerox’s growing digital portfolio. As the copier company sought to establish the office of the future, it would soon acquire the influential minicomputer manufacturer <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/340">Scientific Data Systems</a> and establish the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/karateka-2.png" alt="Karateka Atari 7800 (1988)"> <em>Karateka</em> Atari 7800 (1988) <i></i> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77183/karateka-1984">Board Game Geek</a>
</figure>
<p>Padwa founded Basic Systems with the influential psychologist Francis Mechner. I was first exposed to Francis Mechner as a child playing <em>Karateka</em> (1984) on my Atari 7800<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The original version was written by Jordan Mechner and published by Broderbund in 1984. The Atari 7800 version was written by Jack Sandberg, Sr.&nbsp;at Ibid Inc.&nbsp;and published by Atari in 1987.</span></span> and then later <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) on my family’s PC. Francis Mechner was the composer for these games, both written by his son <a href="http://jordanmechner.com/">Jordan Mechner</a>. The elder Mechner is something of a renaissance man: starting several successful businesses, speaking five languages, publishing cross-disciplinary theoretical insights, performing as a concert pianist, and achieving a 5-dan rating in Go.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Padwa and Mechner’s company also published the <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=TnVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">original edition</a> of “Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess” in 1966. The best-selling book is still in print today.</span></span></p>
<p>These characters provide a sampling of the environment that nurtured Ram Dass. He would soon leave these comforts to join Padwa and his Land Rover on a road trip from Tehran to India in search of a spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Ram Dass ultimately stayed in India for some time (as did Padwa’s Land Rover), leading to the insights that birthed the book <em>Be Here Now</em>. This book’s influence is without question. It was a significant contributor to the American counterculture movement and a starting point for many Western practitioners of Buddhism and Yoga.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/be-here-now.webp" alt="Be Here Now by Ram Dass (1971)"> <em>Be Here Now</em> by Ram Dass (1971) <i></i> <a href="https://www.gardenfairyco.com/product/be-here-now-ram-dass">Garden Fairy Co.</a>
</figure>
<p>Ram Dass spends the first part of the book describing his journey. It involves a dive into the world of psychedelic drugs and their benefits and limitations. His experience essentially opens him up to Eastern mysticism. He finds surprisingly few charlatans on the road through Central Asia and India. The book’s pivotal guru broadens Ram Dass’ mind through a process of “no teaching” because “his lessons aroused in me just affirmation… as if I knew it all already.”</p>
<p>The author strikes an important difference between <em>teacher</em> and <em>guru</em>. “A teacher points the way” while “a guru is the way.” Ram Dass’ awakening, and this book, is the result of the guru’s care.</p>
<p>This leads to a beautifully illustrated but overtly dogmatic section where Ram Dass attempts wake the reader up. The writer’s intention is rooted in Buddhism’s long practice of shifting the practitioner’s habitual and unquestioned perception of the world.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>The guru offers a few clever turns of phrases in this effort, “If a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets” and “If you wear shoe leather, the whole earth is covered with leather.”</span></span> Ram Dass’ spiritual youth feels most pronounced here. He doesn’t have the language of a guru or a teacher; it is the voice of an enthusiastic lecturer who is convinced that he has uncovered the Truth.</p>
<p>The final section of the book is a collection of quotes and techniques divided into various “ingredients for a sacred life” such as <em>Sleeping</em>, <em>Truth</em>, <em>Time and Space</em>, <em>Pranayam</em>, etc…. It is pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ram Dass makes it clear that there can be no <em>knower</em> if one truly wants to <em>know</em> the wisdom contained in <em>Be Here Now</em>; the rational mind that separates <em>subject</em> from <em>object</em> is an illusion.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>(Loc. 4594, 4613)</span></span> This illusion is driven by an attachment to the self as special and wholly separate from everything else.</p>

</figure>
<p>Deep within the cartridge of <em>Karateka</em> on the Atari 7800 are a list of instructions that drive the machine. But the programmer did mix in one human-readable message with the computer code: “Mommy and Me Are One.” This bizarre statement is unique to the Atari 7800 cartridge. It does not appear in other versions. It never appears on screen. It is only visible to those who are looking at the code contained within.<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>“<a href="https://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/78karateka.htm">Digital Press Easter Eggs: Karateka</a>”, <em>digitpress.com</em>, 2010.</span></span></p>
<p>The phrase is almost certainly related to a paper published by Lloyd Silverman and Joel Weinberger in a 1985 edition of <em>American Psychologist</em> entitled “<a href="https://content.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.40.12.1296">Mommy and I Are One: Implications For Psychotherapy</a>”. The authors assert that the titular message can help motivate people even when stated subliminally.</p>
<p>Countless studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefits of “oneness.” In the case of the mother, oneness is self-evident. We were all physically connected at one point. And deep within us exists a DNA code that has been directly passed from mother to child for millennia. This is the ancient information that sets the foundation for consciousness.</p>
<p>The reality of a consciousness larger than ourselves is at the root of <em>Be Here Now.</em> But rather than establish a God or a single methodology, Ram Dass continually asserts that the ego blinds us to the grand web of connections that pervade our everyday experience. The way to lift the veil is to simply practice living in the moment. Or as Suzuki Roshi is quoted, “a Zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously.”<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>(Loc. 4728)</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/russia">Russia</a>‘s parliament, is looking at placing fines on individuals and companies in the country who use Western-based satellite Internet services. The bill, if passed into law, is to avoid access to the Internet using <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/spacex">SpaceX</a>‘s Starlink service, OneWeb, or other network means aside Russian satellite constellations under development.</p>
<p>in the Russian edition of Popular Mechanics</p>
<p>According to a recent report , the proposed fines is ranging from 10-30 thousand rubles ($135-$405) for ordinary users, and from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles ($6,750 to $13,500) for companies who make use of the Western satellite services.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Elon Musk has responded to the tweet with “We’re just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated”</p>
<p>Members of the Duma believe that accessing the Internet freely would skip the country’s System of Operational Search Measures, which is monitoring Internet usage and mobile communications..<br>
Being part of the Russia’s strict control on media and communications, all Russian Internet traffic are compelled to navigate via a Russian communications provider.</p>
<p>Russia may, over time, however, block Starlink service. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia;s Space chief sees SpaceX as a chief competitor in spaceflight.</p>
<p>Starlink, Rogozin had said in August 2020 that it’s part of “a rather marauding, strong, high-technology policy of the United States, which makes use of Shock and Awe so as to improve, ahead of other, their military interests.</p>
<p>The ban on OneWeb is rather funny, with the notion that the company uses the Russian Soyuz rocket to launch almost all of its fist constellation into orbit. Every month, OneWeb satellite launches are planned, mainly from spaceports in Baikonur, Kazahkstan, and Vostochny, Russia. OneWeb is effectively assisting to shore the striving Russian launch industry in a period when SpaceX is undersell the country on commercial launch agreements.</p>
<p>Russia has it in plan to design its own satellite internet constellation, Sfera. While its affordability is yet to stand, it is most likely to be launched in 2024, according to IntelliNews. Expected cost of the project is about 1.5 trillion rubles (around $20 billion), it would supposedly allow the Russia to effectively monitor domestic internet traffic,</p>

      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa9b988f899fba979b8e889382d495889d"><span data-cfemail="7c1d1e090f193c111d080e150452130e1b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

using a template called <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumen</a> and it was just what I needed at the
time. Since then I have have gone from using a template to creating my
blog.</p><p>Over the years I have made my own <a href="https://lengstorf.com/progressive-disclosure-of-complexity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Disclosure of

and themes out there to get you up and running in minutes, this post
is going to focus on what you need to do to build your own blog.
Starting with the most basic “Hello World!” to deploying your code to
production.</p><h2 id="what-youre-going-to-build"><a href="#what-youre-going-to-build" aria-label="what youre going to build permalink"></a>What you’re going to build</h2><p>You’re going to build a developer blog with MDX support (for some
React components in Markdown goodness), so you will be able to add
your own React components into your Markdown posts.</p><p><strong>There’ll be:</strong></p><div><ul><li>Adding a Layout</li><li>Basic styling with styled-components</li><li>Code blocks with syntax highlighting</li><li>Copy code snippet to clipboard</li><li>Cover images for the posts</li><li>Configuring an SEO component</li><li>Deploying it to Netlify</li></ul></div><h2 id="whos-this-how-to-for"><a href="#whos-this-how-to-for" aria-label="whos this how to for permalink"></a>Who’s this how-to for?</h2><p>People that may have used Gatsby before as a template and now want to

(bash, zsh or fish) and a text editor.</p><p>I do like to use <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codesandbox.io</a> for these sort of guides to reduce
the barrier to entry but in this case I have found there are some
limitations with starting out from scratch on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codesandbox.io</a> which
doesn’t make this possible.</p><p>I have made a guide on getting set up for web development with
<a href="http://scottspence.com/2018/12/24/wsl-bootstrap-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Web-Dev Bootstrap</a> and covered the same process in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAsdQuQ-1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu as
well</a>.</p><p>Ok? Time to get started!</p><h2 id="hello-world"><a href="#hello-world" aria-label="hello world permalink"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Kick this off with the Gatsby ‘hello world’, you’ll need to initialise
the project with:</p><p>I suggest that you commit this code to a git repository, so you should
start with a <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>touch</span><span> .gitignore</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"# Project dependencies</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>.cache</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>node_modules</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span># Build directory</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>public</span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span># Other</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>.DS_Store</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>yarn-error.log"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> .gitignore</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok now is a good time to do a <code>git init</code> and if you’re using VSCode
you’ll see the changes reflected in the sidebar.</p><h3 id="basic-hello-world"><a href="#basic-hello-world" aria-label="basic hello world permalink"></a>basic hello world</h3><p>Ok a Gatsby hello world, get started with the bare minimum! Install
the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby react react-dom</span></p></pre></div></div><p>You’re going to need to create a pages directory and add an index
file. You can do that in the terminal by typing the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p src/pages</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/pages/index.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, now you can commence the hello word incantation! In the newly
created <code>index.js</code> enter the following:</p><div><div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you need to add the Gatsby develop script to the <code>package.json</code>
file, <code>-p</code> specifies what port you want to run the project on and <code>-o</code>
opens a new tab on your default browser, so in this case
<code>localhost:9988</code>:</p><div><div data-language="json"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>"dev"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gatsby develop -p 9988 -o"</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok it’s time to run the code! From the terminal type the npm script
command you just created:</p><blockquote><p>Note I’m using Yarn for installing all my dependencies and running
scripts, if you prefer you can use npm just bear in mind that the
content on here uses yarn, so swap out commands where needed</p></blockquote><p>And with that the “Hello World” incantation is complete 🧙!</p><h2 id="add-content"><a href="#add-content" aria-label="add content permalink"></a>Add content</h2><p>Ok, now you have the base your blog you’re going to want to add some
content, first up we’re going to get the convention out of the way.
For this how-to, the date format will be a logical way, the most
logical way for a date format is <strong>YYYYMMDD</strong>, fight me!</p><p>So you’re going to structure your posts content in years, in each one
of those you’re going to have another folder relating to the post with
the (correct) date format for the beginning of the file followed by
the title of the post. You could drill into this further if you like
by separating out months and days depending on the volume of posts
going this may be a good approach. In this case and in the examples
provided the convention detailed will be used.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p posts/2019/</span><span>{</span><span>2019</span><span>-06-01-hello-world,2019-06-10-second-post,2019-06-20-third-post</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-01-hello-world/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-10-second-post/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-20-third-post/index.mdx</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok that’s your posts set up now you need to add some content to them,
each file you have in here should have frontmatter. Frontmatter is a
way to assign properties to the contents, in this case a <code>title</code>,
published <code>date</code> and a <code>published</code> flag (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).</p><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Hello World - from mdx!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-01</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>#</span><span> h1 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>My first post!!</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>##</span><span> h2 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>###</span><span> h3 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Second Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-10</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my second post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>####</span><span> h4 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>#####</span><span> h5 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>######</span><span> h6 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Third Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-20</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my third post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span> with a block quote!</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="gatsby-config-api"><a href="#gatsby-config-api" aria-label="gatsby config api permalink"></a>Gatsby config API</h2><p>Ok, now you’re going to configure Gatsby so that it can read your
super awesome content you just created. So, first up you need to
create a <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file, in the terminal create the file:</p><h2 id="plugins"><a href="#plugins" aria-label="plugins permalink"></a>Plugins</h2><p>And now you can add the plugins Gatsby needs to use for sourcing and
displaying the the files you just created.</p><h3 id="gatsby-source-filesystem"><a href="#gatsby-source-filesystem" aria-label="gatsby source filesystem permalink"></a>Gatsby source filesystem</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> collects the files on the local

our Markdown documents and the heart of how the content is displayed
in the blog.</p><p>Now is a good time to also add in dependent packages for the Gatsby
plugin MDX which are <code>@mdx-js/mdx</code> and <code>@mdx-js/react</code>.</p><p>In the terminal install the dependencies:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-source-filesystem</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now its time to configure <code>gatsby-config.js</code>:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  siteMetadata</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-plugin-mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        extensions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>`</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>.md</span><span>`</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-source-filesystem</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>        path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>        name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="query-data-from-graphql"><a href="#query-data-from-graphql" aria-label="query data from graphql permalink"></a>Query data from GraphQL</h2><p>Ok now you can see what the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> and
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-plugin-mdx</a> have done for us. You can now go to the Gatsby
GraphQL GraphiQL explorer and check out the data:</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  allMdx </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    nodes </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      frontmatter </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>        title</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        date</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata"><a href="#site-metadata" aria-label="site metadata permalink"></a>Site Metadata</h2><p>When you want to reuse common pieces of data across the site (for
example, your site title), you can store that data in <code>siteMetadata</code>,
you touched on this when defining the <code>gatsby-config.js</code>, now you’re
going to separate this out from the <code>module.exports</code>, why? It will be
nicer to reason about once the config is filled with plugins. At the
top of <code>gatsby-config.js</code> add a new object variable for the site
metadata:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> siteMetadata </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now query the Site Metadata with GraphQL.</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  site </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    siteMetadata </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      title</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      description</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata-hook"><a href="#site-metadata-hook" aria-label="site metadata hook permalink"></a>Site metadata hook</h2><p>Ok, so, that’s cool n’ all but how am I meant to use it? Well do some
of the code stuff and make a React hook so you can get your site data
in any component you need it.</p><p>Create a folder to keep all your hooks in and create a file for our
hook, in the terminal do:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>mkdir</span><span> src/hooks</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/hooks/useSiteMetadata.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, and in your newly created file were going to use the Gatsby
<code>useStaticQuery</code> hook to make your own hook:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> graphql</span><span>,</span><span> useStaticQuery </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'gatsby'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useSiteMetadata</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> site </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useStaticQuery</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    graphql</span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      query SITE_METADATA_QUERY {</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>        site {</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>          siteMetadata {</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>            title</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>            description</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>          }</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>        }</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      }</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> site</span><span>.</span><span>siteMetadata</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you can use this hook anywhere in your site, so do that now in

<p>
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com/">TechZing</a> a few months back and
is something I've been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
<a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/about/">Lance Jones</a>
who referenced the concept in a recent <a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/">blog post</a> I have finally been spurred into
action.
</p>
<p>
If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of
serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly
proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is
that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words,
you make your own luck.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. When you pour energy into a passion, you develop an expertise
and an expertise of any kind is valuable. But quite often that value can actually
be magnified by the number people who are made aware of it. The reason is that
when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take
action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never
have predicted. Maybe they'll want to hire you, or partner with you, or invest in
you, or who knows what. But in whatever way it happens, it will be serendipitous.
</p>
<p>
But it's not just the expertise that's important, the very passion that created
the expertise has value in its own right. This is because people want to be excited
about things and passion is infectious. When you do something you're excited about
you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you
share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy my mathematically oriented brain I've gone one step further and formalized
the concept into the equation L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling.
This demonstrates clearly that the more you do and the more people you tell about it,
the larger your Luck Surface Area will become. And while I like equations, it's the
graphical representation that really brings the concept home.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Stories, not people, rule our world. We’re always telling ourselves a story about how the world works, and this makes stories very powerful.</p>

<p>For example, consider this story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An American couple crash their car, die, and ascend to Heaven. God meets them, and they ask “What were the real results of the 2020 election, and who was behind the fraud?”
</p><p>
God says, “There was no fraud, my children. Biden won fair and square.” After a few seconds of stunned silence, the husband turns to the wife and whispers, “This goes higher up than we thought.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the couple’s political belief supercede God?</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, what was an entertaining story became something people believed in. This matters because the stories we tell ourselves change how we view the world.</p>

<p>The unreasonable impact of stories confused me. How can a story have so much power?! For the past year, I’ve explored this question, and stumbled upon some surprising connections.</p>

<p>This post explores these connections and what they mean for you: from how stories create beliefs, to lessons from master storytellers about what to be wary of, ending with four powerful stories that have shaped humanity.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ll also figure out why our couple in Heaven think as they do.</p>

<h2 id="the-belief-hypothesis-spectrum-of-stories">The Belief-Hypothesis Spectrum of Stories</h2>

<p>Consider two stories. Story One is about the economy - how we’re doing great, or not so great, this year. Story Two is about Alice, a rabbit, and a rabbithole.</p>

<p>Which story are you more likely to believe?</p>

<p>Ask young kids, and they’ll probably connect with Alice and the rabbit. The economy? That’s too abstract - sounds like someone created it out of thin air.</p>

<p>While you might believe the story of the economy more, little kids might believe the story of Alice in Wonderland more.</p>

<p>So, we believe in some stories more than others. This degree of belief changes the nature of stories so much so that each kind of story has its own name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories we believe in are beliefs</li>
  <li>Stories we don’t believe in are lies, or fiction</li>
  <li>Stories we’re not sure about are hypotheses</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting question to ask here is ‘How do we start believing in stories? How does a story move from fiction to belief?’</p>

<p>Everything starts as a story created by someone. Some call it fiction, others call it lies, some others call it belief, and a small minority calls it a hypothesis.</p>

<p>For many of us, an oft-repeated story, spoken by people we love or admire, becomes a belief.</p>

<p>However, a small minority believes a different story. Their story says not to believe any story just because someone we love or admire said it. Evidence reigns supreme. This is the story of science and rationality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, stories materialise a little too easily. If a boss is scolding an employee, others can make up stories - hypotheses - about why this might be the case. When they finally hear from the employee, some, or maybe all stories become false, and the current story, as told by the employee, becomes the leading belief.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The most common way of creating new stories though, is using templates we’ve heard before. More familiar stories give us more confidence in what’s going on.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example, consider three colleagues making up the story of what happened.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Colleague 1: “He talked to aliens without reporting them”</li>
  <li>Colleague 2: “He banged the bosses’ wife”</li>
  <li>Colleague 3: “He made a mistake on the report”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first colleague’s story is wildly imaginative (and hard for us to take seriously), while the second and third  are templates we’ve seen before. Given the boss isn’t going bat-shit crazy, it’s probably the second colleague’s story, and not the third’s.</p>

<p>Stories might have seemed invisible beforehand, but they’re our primary sense-making tool to understand the world.</p>

<h2 id="mental-models-are-stories">Mental Models are Stories</h2>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental models</a> are frameworks and heuristics that help explain the world. Sound familiar? They are stories we repeatedly tell ourselves.</p>

<p>This gives a second dimension to stories. If the X axis is degree of belief, the Y axis is degree of explaining-power.</p>

<p>Remember how we prefer stories we’ve heard before, fitting them into templates? The templates are our mental models. They are things we’ve seen happen.</p>

<p>All models are necessarily a simplification of real life - the map isn’t the territory, which means you lose some information when you create the model. The quality of the model depends on what kind of information you lose.</p>

<p>If a map of roads in your country removes all information about trees and their varieties, you’ll probably still find the map useful. However, if you’re a forester, this map is all but useless for you.</p>

<p>Hence, all models are wrong, yet some remain useful.</p>

<p>Stories are also a simplification of real life. Further, simple stories are easy to tell, easy to understand, and easy to spread. Complicated stories don’t go too far.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, on the story of his success, echoes the same sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Steve [Jobs] and I will always get more credit than we deserve, because otherwise the story gets too complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember our couple in Heaven contesting the election results? They have a single story in their mind with no room for alternatives: The elections were rigged. They don’t have a story to help them test out new stories. They stick to their own story, until they find a new more powerful story to replace it.</p>

<p>Since mental models are stories, meta-mental models apply to stories too. This leads to interesting implications.</p>

<p>For example, a famous meta-mental model goes: “to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Applied to stories, “to a man with a single story, everything fits into the same story.”</p>

<p>What can our couple in Heaven do about this?</p>

<p>The above example hints at another interesting implication: we can use stories to counteract other stories.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are stories about human psychology. In the face of pressure, poor mental hygiene, or a great sounding story, we end up making catastrophic mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, availability bias is a story professing that what comes to mind first is usually not the complete picture.</p>

<p>This story is counteracting other stories.</p>

<p>It’s  fighting simple stories that are top of mind. It’s a story telling you to beware of stories that have been designed to be so simple (and thus necessarily wrong) that they stay on top of your mind.</p>

<p>If the biases are cancer, learning the story to beware of them is chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="stories-are-a-vehicle-for-change">Stories are a Vehicle for Change</h2>

<p>A big question we haven’t yet touched upon is ‘Why do we tell stories?’</p>

<p>Stories move people. A story that moves us, compels us to change. It may not be enough to effect change, but it’s a necessary ingredient.</p>

<p>For example, people donate more to charity when they hear a story about one death, instead of a statistic about how many people died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling new stories isn’t just for generating new hypotheses, but for eventually changing your mind, and forming new beliefs.</p>

<p>This third dimension of stories is how effective they are at driving action.</p>

<p>Because of this potency, advertising leads with stories instead of raw facts.</p>

<p>Not just advertisers - news channels do this too. A lot of news is telling new stories for you to believe. Depending on the news channel, there can be zero, or a lot of evidence supporting their stories. And, without a story to counteract these stories, you’ll either believe what they’re saying, without checking the evidence, or completely discard it, based on who is telling the story.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why kids believe everything they’re told when they’re small. They haven’t learned a story that says “Judge for yourself what is true - other people often tell lies to further their own agendas.”</p>

<p>There are three ways to counteract a new story that we’ve already seen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Story of Science - the hunt for evidence</li>
  <li>The power of believing in only a single story - or the man with a hammer</li>
  <li>Learning about cognitive biases</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story.  - <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/04/an-anecdote-and-a-statistical-analysis-walk-into-a-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third meta-story has lots of heuristics, and lots of literature to explore.</p>

<p>Specific to advertisers, salesmen, and news channels telling you a story, one good way to counter their story is learning why you’re being told a story. If the storyteller has something to gain, and they’re a master storyteller, they’ll be able to move you to action quickly. Beware their motives for telling you a story.</p>

<p>All the warnings aside, if you can harness this power yourself - you can tell yourself compelling stories - then you can effect change in yourself. That’s something we’ll explore soon, too.</p>

<h2 id="stories-create-blindspots">Stories Create Blindspots</h2>

<p>Just like how all models are wrong, and some are useful; all stories are wrong, some are useful. It’s very easy to make useless stories sound useful.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/07/our-top-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you talk about your last job, your last vacation, the things that happened when you were 12…<br>
What do you lead with?<br>
Do you lead with, “I broke my ankle that summer and rarely got out” or is it, “I stuck with my reading regimen and read all of Shakespeare.”<br>
Because both are true.<br>
The top story is the one that informs our narrative, and our narrative changes our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A story is a lens that is prone to framing: how you frame the story changes its focus. This creates blindspots.</p>

<p>Stories are never going to be the …</p></div></div>

<p>We started wondering if we might have lost something in this transition. Sure,
machine learning covers a lot of ground but it is also capable of making bad
decision. We've also reached a stage of hype that folks forget that many
classification problems can be handled by natural intelligence too.</p>
<p>This package contains scikit-learn compatible tools that should make it easier
to construct and benchmark rule based systems that are designed by humans. You
can also use it in combination with ML models.</p>

<p><span><b>TL;DR</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s the game. Flip a coin. You win 50% of your net worth on heads, but only lose 40% on tails. How many times should you play?</li>
<li>Despite the apparently favourable odds, chances are you’ll eventually go bust. Why?</li>
<li>This is because of the path-dependency of time. Because of the fallacious ergodicity assumption.</li>
<li>Ergodicity is when the ensemble-average equals the time-average. For instance, when 10 people doing something once produces the same result as 1 person doing it 10 times.</li>
<li>Essentially, ergodicity lets you conveniently convert time into a space equivalent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For non-ergodic systems, the aggregate’s performance is a misleading indicator of individual performance. As a whole, the average might look like it’s winning, despite majority of individuals losing.</li>
<li>The Kelly criterion allows us to optimize our bet size to maximize long-term winnings.</li>
<li>While most financial systems are non-ergodic, the foundations of classical economic theory rests on fallacious ergodic assumptions – from DCF valuations to the way we measure GDP growth.</li>
<li>Putting these ergodicity concepts to practical use, I’ve now increased the weighting I give to non-recoverable risks.</li>

<p>You’re probably familiar with these common mistakes in interpreting data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <strong>average</strong> when you should be looking at <strong>median.</strong> <span>e.g. for personal income distributions</span></li>
<li>Looking at <strong>aggregates</strong> rather than more <strong>granular</strong> <strong>segments.</strong> <span>e.g. sales increased 10% this year, but all of it came from a new business line, while the core businesses remained flat</span></li>
<li>Mistaking <strong>non-linear</strong> outcomes to be <strong>linear</strong> ones <span>e.g. cumulative number of COVID-19 cases</span></li>
</ul>
<p>But you’re probably less familiar with the <strong>ergodicity assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly prevalent in systems, but generally poorly understood and barely known.</p>
<p>Much like Black Swans, <a href="https://neurabites.com/antifragility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antifragility, non-linearity, and optionality</a>, it’s another concept that Nassim Taleb has raised his voice on. But this one has received far less attention than others.</p>
<p>And hence I write this post in parts:</p>

<h3><span><strong>1. Going bust despite favourable odds</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><b>1.1. Definition</b></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more formal definition from Ole Peters from his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dec-19 Nature journal article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the <strong>time</strong> <strong>average</strong> and the <strong>expectation</strong> <strong>value</strong> of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mouthful right? Let’s park the definition here for now, and take baby steps with a more digestible example.</p>

<p><span><b>1.2. Rigged coin flip game</b></span></p>
<p>Flip a coin. If heads, your net wealth is <strong>increased by 50%</strong>. If tails, your net wealth is <strong>decreased by 40%</strong>.</p>
<p>Would you play? If so, how many times?</p>
<p>At first glance it seems like the game is rigged in your favour. We expect an equal number of heads and tails in the long run. Given you are paid more from each head than you are penalised for on each tail, you should just play as many times as possible right? Besides, even if you end up on a losing streak, you don’t ever lose all your money, you only lose 40% of whatever you were on. You can win it back with the favourable payoffs. Right?</p>
<p>Well, here’s a simulation of what could happen if you played 50 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal axis is time.</li>
<li>Vertical axis is net worth, a function of time.</li>
<li>N=1 means we’re looking at the outcome for 1 individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a trend here. We were expecting an upward gradient given the favourable odds. But we end up at a loss. Strange. Maybe this guy was unlucky?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the simulation for this one individual into 1,000 rounds.</p>

<p>Looks like they’re stuck at zero. This is surprisingly given the favourable odds. We expected the math to offset the unlucky first 50 rounds. Is this guy just really unlucky?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green line shows the <strong>average</strong> y-values (wealth) for 100 players at each x-value (time). Again, no clear trend.</p>
<p>Simulate for 10,000 players (red line) and we start to see a trend. On average, this group of 10,000 players is sitting on a nice ~10x profit.</p>
<p>Simulate a million concurrent players, and the trend is more apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, a logarithmic axis shows this more clearly.</p>

<p>The average wealth of a million people increases exponentially as they play this game. <span>(Recall from all the March COVID-19 graphs that a linear increase on logarithmic axis means exponential growth. It’s a neat trick to distinguish exponential growth from mere very fast growth.)</span></p>
<p>This trend persists as we extend time to 1,000 rounds and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But wait. This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Earlier, we showed that for an <strong>individual</strong> player, wealth trends to <strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>over time.</p>
<p>But for the <strong>aggregate</strong> of individuals, wealth trends <strong>exponentially upwards</strong> over time.</p>
<p>How can many things that trend to zero sum up to exponential growth?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>there’s a few really lucky bastards that distort the average.</strong></p>
<p>A more technical answer: <strong>ergodicity</strong>. Or more specifically, a false assumption of ergodicity for this non-ergodic game.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper dive and explore some scenarios for an individual starting with $100.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: 2 scenarios</p>
<ul>

<p>Some observations.</p>
<p>(i) In aggregate, payout is favourable to the players since average wealth is consistently above starting value of $100. This is the ensemble-average.</p>
<p>(ii) But this asymmetric payoff is only favourable on the <strong>ensemble dimension</strong> (taking the aggregate and dividing it by number of players). The pay-off structure is not favourable to an individual on the <strong>temporal </strong>(time) <strong>dimension</strong>. On an individual level, people are actually more likely to lose the longer they play. Gambler’s ruin. Thus, looking at ensemble returns is a poor indicator of individual returns.</p>
<p>So as the game goes on: the house loses money as they’re paying out more than they receive, while more people become losers, and just a lucky few get obscenely rich. <span>(For context, the winnings from 100 consecutive heads, $4.1 x 10<sup>19</sup> is taking the global GDP of ~$100t and multiplying it by 400k years. So all of the wealth we’re creating today multiplied by longer than Homo sapiens’ existence. The probability of 1 in 2<sup>100 </sup>is even more ludicrous.)</span></p>
<p>There’s many variations to the example we explored: e.g. a triple-or-nothing coin flip. We get similar results except instead of decaying to zero, people go completely bust and end the game there, while some extremely lucky get fanatically rich.</p>

<p><span><b>1.3. Back to ergodicity</b></span></p>
<p>Recall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, simulating an individual playing 10,000 rounds gives a drastically different result to simulating 10,000 individuals playing 1 round.</p>
<p>The trajectory of an individual over a long time (time-average) gives a different result to the aggregate of many individual’s trajectories at an instant in time (ensemble-average, aka. space-average).<span>&nbsp;(Note: we can substitute ‘average’ in this statement with expectation value/outcome/probability/pay-off.)</span></p>
<p>What accounts for this difference is the <strong>path-dependent property of time</strong>. This distinction between the ensemble …</p></div></div>

		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The $1.1 trillion wealth gain by 660 U.S. billionaires since March 2020 could pay for:</strong></p>



<ul><li>All of the relief for working families contained in President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, $400-a-week supplements to unemployment benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. (See table below)</li><li>A stimulus check of more than $3,400 for every one of the roughly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank">331 million people in the United States</a>. A family of four would receive over $13,000.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/530913-gop-senator-blocks-bill-for-12k-stimulus-checks-for-second-time" target="_blank">Republicans in Congress resisted</a>&nbsp;sending families stimulus checks most of last year, claiming we couldn’t afford them.</li></ul>

Billionaires are overwhelmingly white men.</p>



<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire. That $154 billion growth in wealth is also about seven times NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2020-budget#:~:text=NASA%27s%20budget%20in%20fiscal%20year%20%28FY%29%202020%20is,by%20a%20supplemental%20budget%20request%20on%2013%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$22.6 billion budget in FY2020</a>, the federal agency Musk has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited with saving his company</a>&nbsp;with a big federal contract when the firm’s rockets were failing and it faced bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Jeff Bezos’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $113 billion on March 18 to $182 billion, an increase of 61%. Adding in his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s wealth of $55 billion on Jan. 18, the two had a combined wealth of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars thanks to their&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;If Bezos’s $68.6 billion growth in wealth was distributed to all his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">810,000 U.S. employees</a>, each would get a windfall bonus of almost $85,000 and Bezos would not be any “poorer” than he was 10 months ago.</li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $54.7 billion on March 18 to $92 billion, an increase of over two-thirds fueled by his&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong></li></ul>



<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>



<p><strong>The $1 trillion wealth gain by 651 U.S. billionaires since mid-March is:</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>
