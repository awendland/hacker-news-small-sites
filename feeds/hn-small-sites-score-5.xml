November 2, 2020 | https://blog.ostorlab.co/hardcoded-secrets.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ostorlab.co/hardcoded-secrets.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Hardcoded secret keys are a convenient target to Bug Bounty hunters and Attackers. They are easy to spot and they can
open a wide gate to sensitive data and privileged access.</p>
<p>Hardcoded secrets caused several high profile breaches in the past, notable ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MyCar</strong>: MyCar is a vehicle telematics systems. The maker  left hardcoded credentials inside its Android and iOS
mobile apps. This left tens of thousands of cars vulnerable to hackers, who could locate car, identify them, unlock them,
start the car or trigger the alarm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uber</strong>: An Uber employee published plaintext credentials within source code that was then posted on Github. 
An attacker found the embedded credentials on GitHub, then used them to gain privileged access on Uber’s Amazon
AWS Instances. The attacker then demanded a 100k$ ransom, that Uber did pay.
 The Uber breach resulted in the exposure of information of 57 million customers, plus roughly 600,000 drivers. Once the
 story became public, Uber paid a settlement of 148M$ and had to delay its IPO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uniguest</strong>: Uniguest provides kiosks (PC, iMac, tablet) available in hotel lobbies (and other places). User can use
them to run simple tasks, such as browsing the web or printing boarding passes.
The API credentials were hardcoded within the application and were used to dump all the data in the Uniguest
cloud database. The data included admin credentials, router and BIOS passwords, product keys and various other sensitive information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardcoded secrets are also commonly reported by Bug Bounty hunters. If you check any of the different Bug Bounty programs, you will
find many disclosed reports pointing to the hardcoded keys in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, <code>Info.plist</code> or some resource file. </p>
<p>Depending on the permissions and use of the key, these vulnerabilities might be awarded up to 1k$. The severity ranges from
elevating privileges, accessing sensitive information, over-bill/theft of a service or conducting a denial of service attack.</p>
<h2>How to find and validate secrets?</h2>
<p>Secrets can be found either statically or dynamically. A common static approach is to search known patterns, for instance
searching for strings matching the following regular expression <code>AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ app8 egrep -r <span>'AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}'</span> . 
Binary file ./resources.arsc correspondant
Binary file ./app.apk correspondant
Binary file ./classes.dex correspondant                                
./assets/google-services-desktop.json:          <span>"current_key"</span>: <span>"AIzaSy....................."</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can find in this repo <a href="https://github.com/l4yton/RegHex">l4yton/RegHex</a> a list of regular expressions to use.</p>
<p>Because not all API keys and secrets are bad or dangerous, and not all pattern outputs are correct; the keys must be checked and the
permissions, roles, scopes, and restrictions (more on that latter) must be enumerated and verified.
<code>streaak</code> published a repo <a href="https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks">streaak/keyhacks</a> listing <code>curl</code> commands to check a wide range of keys.</p>
<p>Below are some examples for Firebase keys and Facebook secrets:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl -s -X POST --header <span>"Authorization: key=AIzaS........."</span> --header <span>"Content-Type:application/json"</span> <span>'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send'</span> -d <span>'{"registration_ids":["1"]}'</span>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;INVALID_KEY_TYPE&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY <span>BGCOLOR</span><span>=</span><span>"#FFFFFF"</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>=</span><span>"#000000"</span>&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;INVALID_KEY_TYPE&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Error <span>401</span>&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token<span>\?</span>client_id<span>\=</span>51XXXX<span>\&amp;</span>client_secret<span>\=</span>0cbd4XXXXX<span>\&amp;</span>redirect_uri<span>\=\&amp;</span>grant_type<span>\=</span>client_credentials
<span>{</span><span>"access_token"</span>:<span>"5181XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</span>,<span>"token_type"</span>:<span>"bearer"</span><span>}</span>% 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once a key is found, the API documentation should be your best-friend to determine what permissions does it have and what
sort of actions can be performed. Take for instance instance a facebook application, you can then use the <code>https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/{applicationId}/permissions</code> endpoint to list permissions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl <span>"https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/51XXXXXXXX/permissions?access_token=51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</span>
<span>{</span><span>"data"</span>:<span>[{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"email"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_show_list"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_messaging"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"groups_show_list"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_read_engagement"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"public_profile"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}]}</span>%   
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another CLI friendly tool is Yelp's <code>detect-secret</code>: <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets">Yelp/detect-secrets</a>.
The tool detects a smaller subset of keys and implements validation for some a well.</p>
<p>Ostorlab automates the process of finding and checking keys and secrets and covers 53 secret types at time this article is written. 
A secret agent collects keys matching patterns or used dynamically by specific APIs or intercepted over the wire. The agent
then checks these keys to confirm if valid by iterating over all known services. </p>
<p>This a screenshot showing an example confirming a valid key and the matching service**.</p>

<p>Just out of the last 10k apps scanned, we have reported over 200 valid secrets granting access to highly sensitive data
or critical services, like Payment or Source Code. Below are some statistics of the number of keys found per service:</p>

<h2>How to fix it?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding is Acceptable, nothing to do here</strong>: Most services provide best practices for how to use the API or secret. Some APIs are acceptable if embedded in an application. Firebase is an example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Unlike how API keys are typically used, API keys for Firebase services are not used to control access to backend resources; 
that can only be done with Firebase Security Rules. 
Usually, you need to fastidiously guard API keys (for example, by using a vault service or setting the keys as environment variables); 
however, API keys for Firebase services are ok to include in code or checked-in config files.
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternatives are encouraged, I should switch</strong>: Some services offer more secure alternatives to embedding credentials (such as Amazon and Google, example from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">AWS recommendation</a>):</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>You have a mobile app. Do not embed access keys with the app, even in encrypted storage. 
Instead, use Amazon Cognito to manage user identities in your app. This service lets you authenticate users using Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)–compatible identity provider. 
You can then use the Amazon Cognito credentials provider to manage credentials that your app uses to make requests to AWS. For more information, see Using the Amazon Cognito Credentials Provider on the AWS Mobile Blog. 
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding is Dangerous, delegate the actions to the Server</strong>: For some services, embedding keys is an invitation to get hacked, see for instance <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/keys#safe-keys">Stripe documentation</a>. In these cases, having the server must perform the interaction with the service.</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account, such as creating charges or performing refunds. 
Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. 
Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using. 
Control access to your key using a password manager or secrets management service.

In live mode, new secret keys are only visible the first time you access them. 
After that, the Dashboard redacts the API key. When the key is revealed, you can leave a note on the Dashboard describing the location on your own systems where you’ve copied it. 
If you lose your secret key, you can’t recover it from the Dashboard and must roll the key or create another one.
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardening through Remote Key fetching and Key Pinning</strong>: For services that don't provide a per-user authentication service, and
need to be embedded in the application, it’s recommended to retrieve the
key from the server. It is also best practice to restrict the key's permissions (principle of least privilege).
Some service provide the possibility to PIN keys to an application or domain name. Because this 
protection is not perfect, rotating the keys is recommended to limit exposure.</li>
</ul>

    <p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taipei.jpg" alt="Taipei"></p>

<p>Currently living in Taiwan, I recently joined the <a href="https://github.com/taiwangoldcard/taiwan-bot">Taiwan Bot 🤖</a> project along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-lim-0a307550">Shawn</a> and <a href="https://erickhun.com/about/">Eric</a>. The idea is to build a go-to assistant to help foreigners answer their questions about moving to, working, and living in Taiwan (pro-tip: ask the bot where to find cheese or chocolate).</p>

<p>Building a functional and useful chatbot is a non-trivial project. Fortunately, there has been impressive progress in the fields of machine learning and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong> in the past few years. Moreover, the democratization and open-source sharing of cutting-edge deep learning models from research work at large tech companies like Google or Facebook is making it possible for anyone to implement the latest state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/advances-in-semantic-textual-similarity.html">Universal Sentence Encoder</a>, recently released by Google AI, is one of these new models available via <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4">Tensorflow Hub</a>. Trained in a <strong>multi-tasking</strong> fashion, the model can encode sentences into meaningful continuous representations that work well on a range of different tasks. It is thus ideal for <strong>transfer learning</strong> and performs competitively with more complex models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>. Moreover, it can run much faster than BERT or other similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer</a> models and is thus more applicable to real-world problems. There is even a <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2">Lite version</a> of the model, small enough to run in Javascript on the client-side.</p>

<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>

<p>Despite being an amazing place to live, <strong>Taiwan is still misunderstood by most foreigners</strong>. We think that a fun and approachable chatbot could help people understand a lot more about all the great things this place has to offer, as well as answer most of the questions they might have about living here.</p>

<p>We decided to start with a limited scope first and to focus on answering practical questions about moving to and living in Taiwan. Specifically, we chose to focus on visa issues and the recently created <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/">Gold Card program</a>. We plan to expand the bot capabilities in future versions.</p>

<p>When it comes to chatbots, there are a lot of ways to go, and many tools and libraries out there to help you make your plan a reality. However, being just a small team of 3 doing this in our spare time, we didn’t have enough resources and time to build something very sophisticated. We also didn’t want to spend a lot of time to compile a large training dataset. So we looked for the best way to build a system that would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧩 Easy and quick to build</li>
  <li>⚡️ Lightweight and runnable on a small server</li>
  <li>🔧 Iterable and easy to improve</li>
  <li>🧠 Focused on finding relevant answers</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose to build our bot with Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk">Bot Framework SDK</a> for easy development, user management and to be able to easily publish it to multiple platforms like Messenger or Line, the most popular messaging platform in Taiwan. <strong>The only thing remaining was to build the brain behind the messages.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-meaning-behind-a-question">Understanding the meaning behind a question</h2>

<p>The main challenge when building a bot is <strong>relevancy</strong>, and this starts by having a clear understanding of what the user’s intention is. There are many approaches possible to make sense of what the user wants. At the most simple, one could simply look for some keywords such as <code>hello</code>, <code>restaurant</code>, or <code>visa</code>. However, this doesn’t take at all into account all the nuances of the language.</p>

<p>We didn’t have the resources to build a full-scale bot that could recognize the user intention among thousands of possibilities, yet we wanted to create something that could be relevant enough so that people would find it useful. So we needed to find an ideal middle ground between complexity and performance.</p>

<p>One of the most important concepts in NLP is one of <strong>distributed representations</strong>, inspired by the linguistic field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">distributional semantics</a>. The core idea is to encode linguistic items (words, sentences) into <strong>embeddings</strong> (vectors in a large dimensional space) such that items with similar properties should be closer in the resulting space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall know a word by the company it keeps.</p>

  <p><em>- John Rupert Firth (1957)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, similar words will cluster together in the vector space:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/word-embeddings.png" alt="Word Embeddings"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/08/introducing-semantic-reactor-explore-nlp-sheets.html">TensorFlow Blog</a></em></p>

<p>You could do the same as the above but with sentences, effectively encoding them into large vectors which can be compared between themselves using <strong>similarity functions</strong>. Hence sentences with similar vector representations are sentences with similar meaning, topic, syntax…</p>

<h2 id="encoding-questions-with-the-universal-sentence-encoder">Encoding questions with the Universal Sentence Encoder</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> is a powerful Transformer model (in its large version) allowing to extract <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture">embeddings</a> directly from sentences instead of from individual words. It already powers some impressive Google projects such as <a href="https://books.google.com/talktobooks/">Talk to Books</a> or <a href="https://google.github.io/mysteryofthreebots/">Mystery of the Three Bots</a>.</p>

<p>For our chatbot project, we are first using the model to encode all the questions that we think users would want to ask to the bot. This can be done in a few lines of code thanks to the convenient TensorFlow Hub library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>tensorflow</span> <span>as</span> <span>tf</span>
<span>import</span> <span>tensorflow_hub</span> <span>as</span> <span>tfhub</span>

<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tfhub</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>"https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4"</span><span>)</span>

<span>questions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>...</span> <span>]</span>  <span># questions most likely to be asked to the bot
</span><span>answers</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>....</span> <span>]</span>  <span># all answers to the questions above
</span>
<span>batch_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>embeddings</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>questions</span><span>),</span> <span>batch_size</span><span>):</span>
    <span>embeddings</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>(</span><span>questions</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>:</span><span>i</span><span>+</span><span>batch_size</span><span>]))</span>
<span>questions_embeddings</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>embeddings</span><span>,</span> <span>axis</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then whenever a user asks a question, we can just extract its embedding and find the most similar question in our database of embeddings. In our case we use a simple vector dot product as a similary function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_best_answer</span><span>(</span><span>question</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>embedding</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>([</span><span>question</span><span>,])</span>
    <span># compute dot product with each question:
</span>    <span>scores</span> <span>=</span> <span>questions_embeddings</span> <span>@</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>transpose</span><span>(</span><span>embedding</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>answers</span><span>[</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>argmax</span><span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>squeeze</span><span>(</span><span>scores</span><span>).</span><span>numpy</span><span>())]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="google-sheets-as-a-collaborative-database">Google Sheets as a collaborative database</h2>

<p>We built our dataset using a simple Google spreadsheet with 2 columns: questions and answers. Whenever a user asks a question, we just find the most relevant question and return the appropriate answer.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-database.png" alt="Questions Answers Dataset"></p>

<p>This approach, while relatively simple, is a flexible enough for efficiently working together. Querying the data is done once during startup with a few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>gspread</span><span>.</span><span>authorize</span><span>(</span>
    <span>ServiceAccountCredentials</span><span>.</span><span>from_json_keyfile_dict</span><span>(</span><span>SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INFO_DICT</span><span>,</span>
        <span>[</span><span>'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds'</span><span>,</span><span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'</span><span>])</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>sheet</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_FAQ_FILE</span><span>).</span><span>worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_SHEET_NAME</span><span>)</span>
<span>questions</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
<span>answers</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is an example of a conversation with the bot:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-conversation.jpg" alt="Conversation with the bot"></p>

<h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous improvement</h2>

<p>We did our best to think about what would be the most commonly asked questions but, of course, we cannot predict everything people will ask. This is why if you ask a question that is not present in our database, the bot can answer with something completely unrelated. To prevent this, we built a small logging system to be able to track the questions asked to the bot and which question it thought was the most similar (along with the similarity score).</p>

<p>For example, here is what happened behind the scenes during the small conversation above. The first column is the user message. The second column is the most similar question (as based on the embeddings similarity). The third column is the best answer and the last column the computed similarity score. If the similarity score is not good enough, the bot will answer with a generic reply <em>” Sorry, I cannot help with that yet “</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-logs.png" alt="Conversation Logs"></p>

<p>This logging system will also help us improve our answers as more people use the bot and new edge cases are found. Still, no chatbot is perfect, and we think the bot will be most useful in a context where humans can take over when the bot fails. For example, on Slack, we added the bot to a general FAQ channel where people can get assistance from both the bot and humans for more specific information.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-slack.png" alt="Chatbot on Slack"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building an effective chatbot doesn’t have to be a complex project. As long as the scope is relatively narrow, it is possible to use a general encoder model like the Universal Sentence Encoder to build something useful. The hard part is collecting enough questions/answers for the bot to be able to answer most questions. It is also important to regularly monitor what users are asking and complement new data whenever the bot can’t find a relevant answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, when I went from having only Facebook-login on <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> to allow registrations with email address and password, one of my concerns was how to implement this is a way that protects the data and privacy of my users. I don’t have any ads or analytics on the site, the users can select whatever display name they want, and I never stored the email addresses I got from Facebook when a user registered or logged in - only a hashed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> version of the ID. Email addresses and passwords, on the other hand, are a whole other beast, and the consequences of a database breach much worse.</p>
<p>Considering that the only kind of emails I ever need to send out are transactional - no newsletters or other kinds of notifications - the only thing I need to store them for are as identifiers, and can safely be hashed.</p>
<p>For every transactional email I need to send out - registration, account recovery, and email change verification - the user always initiates this by submitting their email address, and it will at that time be available to the backend to perform the needed action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you only use email addresses for transactional emails, you might be able to only store hashed versions of them. For <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> I use SHA512 with a fixed salt, and this has been working perfectly since implementation in June.</p>

While they're still a work in progress, here are some things we think you'll like:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/client/supabase-client">Reference Docs</a> are auto-generated from our Typescript definitions and then enriched with examples. This forces us to document our code and makes it easier to keep everything in sync.</li><li>We added placeholders for the other languages that the community is developing. They have already started with Python, C#, Dart, Rust, and Swift. Expect to see the docs filling up soon!</li><li>We've added sections for all of the open source tools we use, including <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/server/about">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgrest/server/about">PostgREST</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/gotrue/server/about">GoTrue</a>, and <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/realtime/server/about">Realtime</a>. We'll be filling these with lots of valuable information including self-hosting, benchmarks, and simple guides.</li></ul><h3>Errors are returned, not thrown</h3><p>We attribute this improvement to community feedback. This has significantly improved the developer experience. Previously we would throw errors:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> body </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>And now we simply return them:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> data</span><span>,</span><span> error </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><p>After testing this for a while we're very happy with this pattern. Errors are handled next to the offending function. Of course you can always rethrow the error if that's your preference.</p><h3>We created <code>gotrue-js</code></h3><p>Our goal for <code>supabase-js</code> is to tie together many sub-libaries. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing open source tools.</p><p>To maintain this philosophy, we created <a href="https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>gotrue-js</code></a>, a library for Netlify's GoTrue auth server. This libary includes a number of new additions, including third-party logins.</p><p>Previously:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  body</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>signup</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'someone@email.com'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'password'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Now:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user</span><span>,</span><span> error </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>signUp</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'someone@email.com'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  password</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'password'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Enhancements and fixes</h3><ul><li>Native Typescript.

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname2.jpg" alt="slide2"></p>

<p>Resolving a domain name is complex.  It’s not limited to the DNS, the
Domain Name System — A decentralized and hierarchical system to associate
names and other information to IP addresses.<br>
It’s not something we, as users, usually pay attention to.  We notice
it only when we’re facing an issue. It normally works out of the box
but really nobody get the crux.<br>
You search online for clarifications but they barely help and add more
confusion.</p>

<p>Here are some schemas trying to decipher the mystery that domain name
resolution came to be.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname3.jpg" alt="slide3"></p>

<p>One, two, and three, I think you get me, it is not easy.  It’s never as
simple as taking a hostname as a string, getting the DNS address in the
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> config, then sending a request to the DNS on port 53
to be greeted back with the IP.<br>
Behind the scene there are ton of files and libraries involved, all of
this to get a domain name solved.</p>

<p>So in this talk we’ll try to create some order to try to understand thing
as an end-user. Let’s make sense and reason behind this mess even if I
have to say, I don’t get it much myself.<br>
I can’t assess I haven’t made mistakes but if I did, please correct me,
that would be great!</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname4.jpg" alt="slide4"></p>

<p>Let’s start with the misfits, the ones that don’t follow the rules,
the not-invented-here syndrome found within our tools.<br>
When it comes to DNS resolution, there’s no one-size fit all
solution. Obviously, many of us don’t want to deal with all the
complexity, so we say, “let’s pack these bytes ourselves, and forget
the hassle”.<br>
That’s pure heresy though. We’d prefer everything to work the same way,
so that it’s easier to follow. It would be preferable that they all use
the same lib, to all have the same behavior. That is, in our case to rely
on the C standard lib, or the POSIX API our savior.</p>

<p>In all cases, let’s note some software that don’t rely on it, as we said,
all the misfits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ISC/BSD BIND tools: from host, to dig, to drill, to nslookup,
and more, used for debugging chores.</li>
  <li>Firefox/Chrome/Chromium: There are the browsers, because they are one
of a kind, bypassing libc and POSIX mechanism, implementing their own
DNS API for performance reasons and perfectionism.</li>
  <li>Any applications needing advanced DNS features, other than simple name to IP.</li>
  <li>Language that don’t wrap around a libc: The Go programming language
comes to mind. It implements it’s own resolver API.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, I can ease your mind by letting you know that all
of these will at least respect <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and <code>/etc/hosts</code>
configurations. Files that we’ll see in the next sections.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname5.jpg" alt="slide5"></p>

<p>I’ve taken a look at over a dozen different technologies and I think the
best way to understand them is through their archaeologies. There’s a
lot that can be explained about DNS resolution simply based on all the
historic reasons.<br>
The main thing you need to understand, is that there’s not a single
clean library call to resolve a hostname. Standards and new specs have
pilled up over the years, with some software that haven’t followed,
but risking to disappear.</p>

<p>Overall, libc and POSIX provide multiple resolution APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s the historic, low level one provided by ISC/BSD BIND resolver
implementation within libc. Accessed though <code>libresolv/resolv.h</code>
incantation.</li>
  <li>The <code>gethostbyname(3)</code> and related functions, implementing an obsolete
POSIX C specification.</li>
  <li>The <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>, that is the modern POSIX C API for name
resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these combinations, ladies and gentlemen, are the standard ways
to resolve a name.<br>
Newer applications will use <code>getaddrinfo</code> while older ones will use
<code>gethostbyname</code>. Both of these 2 will often rely on something called
NSS and another part to manage <code>resolv.conf</code> access.</p>

<p>Now let’s dive into each of these and you’ll get them like a breeze.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname6.jpg" alt="slide6"></p>

<p>The resolver layer is the oldest and most stable in our quest. It
originates from 1983, today almost 37 years ago, at Berkeley university.</p>

<p>It comes from a project called BIND, Berkely Internet Name Domain, which
was sponsored by a DARPA grants. And like the Berkeley socket that gave
rise to the internet, it has now turned into much much pain.<br>
It was the very first implementation of the DNS specifications. It got
released in BSD4.3 and today the BIND project is maintained by the
Internet Systems Consortium, aka ISC.</p>

<p>It not only offers servers and clients, and the debug tools which we
mentioned earlier, but also offers a library called “libbind”. This
library is the defacto implementation, the standard resolver, the one
of a kind. It is initially based on all the original RFC discussions,
namely RFC 881, 882, and 883.<br>
The BSD people wrote technical papers assessing its feasibility, and
went on recommending and implementing it within BSD.</p>

<p>At that point BIND wasn’t a standard yet, it was an optionally-compiled
code for those who wanted to get their feet wet, those who wanted to
try DNS.<br>
Then it got part of the C standard library interface through <code>resolver</code>,
<code>libresolv</code>, <code>-lresolv</code>, <code>resolv.h</code>, and closed the case</p>

<p>If you take a look at most Unix-like systems today, from MacOS, to
OpenBSD, to Linux, and company, you’ll see clearly in <code>resolv.h</code>, the
copyright going back to 1983, to that very date. But obviously, it depends
on the choice of the implementer, a case by case</p>

<p>So then the code diverged, there’s the libresolv provided
by the C standardization and the libbind provided by the BIND
implementation. However, most Unix only add small specific changes to
their needs. For example, resolver in glibc is baselined off libbind
from BIND version 8.2.3.</p>

<p>This layer is normally used for low level DNS interactions because it’s
missing the goodies we’ll see later in this presentation.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about environments and configurations.</p>

<p>The resolver configuration file</p>

<p>The resolver configuration files were mentioned in BIND first release,
in section 4.2.2.2 of “The Design and Implementation of ‘Domain Name
Resolver’” by Mark Painter based on RFC883, part of the DNS RFC series.</p>

<p>This particular file being <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, you’ll see it hardcoded in
<code>resolv.h</code> and if that file is missing, it’ll fall back to the localhost
as the DNS, just to be safe.<br>
Additionally, there’s <code>/etc/host.conf</code>, according to the manpage also
“the resolver configuration file”, it’s so appropriately named. It’s a
conf that dictates the working of <code>/etc/hosts</code>, the “static table lookup
for hostsnames”.</p>

<p>So what’s in these files.<br>
<code>resolv.conf</code> takes care of how to resolve names and which <code>nameserver</code>
to use for that, while <code>hosts</code> simply has a list of known host aliases,
ip + name, as simple as that.</p>

<p>Within <code>resolv.conf</code> you can also have a <code>search</code> list for domains.
That’s if a name you’re searching for doesn’t have the minimum number
of dots in it then it’ll add one of these TLD to it, top-level-domains,
and keep searching until it finds something that fits.<br>
This can also be manipulated in an environment variable <code>LOCALDOMAIN</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>'example www.example.com'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ./host_aliases
<span>$ HOSTALIASES</span><span>=</span><span>"./host_aliases"</span> getent hosts example
93.184.216.34   www.example.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>There can also be a sortlist IP netmask, for when there’s many results
to match but you don’t want to give priority to the cloud VPS that lives
only for cash.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the <code>option</code> field, also overriden on the command
line by the <code>RES_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. It manipulates the minimum
number of dots we mentioned and also if you want can set debug as enabled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <code>hosts</code> file is but a key-value db, simply made of domain
names and IPs.</p>

<p>Its config also lets you change the order of results and for the rest
you have <code>host.conf</code> to consult.</p>

<p>So remember, that all of these are mostly used everywhere because it’s
the lowest layer.  So it’s used by libbind and libresolv but also the
custom NIH syndrome</p>

<p>Alright, so far that’s all classic clean stuff. Let’s move on to the
next sections, you’ll scratch your head until there’s no dandruff.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname7.jpg" alt="slide7"></p>

<p>The C library POSIX specs create a superset over the C standard
library. They add a few simpler calls to resolve hostnames and make it
easy. These focus on returning A and AAAA records only, ipV4 and ipV6
respsectively.<br>
There’s <code>gethostbyname(3)</code> which is deprecated, and there’s the newer
<code>getaddrinfo(3)</code> defined in IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which mainly adds
RFC3493 aka ipV6 is now supported.  So applications are recommended to
use this updated version unless they want to divert from mainland.</p>

<p>There are functions to resolve IP addresses to host names, but let’s
focus only on name to ip for today, I know it’s lame.</p>

<p>Apart from ipV6 support being added, some internal structures have been
updated as they weren’t so safe between subsequent calls and thus could

<p>Obviously they both return different structures.</p>

<p><code>hostent</code> struct is returned to <code>gethostbyname</code> function caller.
while <code>getaddrinfo</code> returns an <code>addrinfo</code> structure.
Both being defined in the <code>netdb.h</code> header.</p>

<p>Some libc implementations will get fancy and add their own modified
versions of <code>gethostbyname</code>. For instance in glibc they add support for
ipV6 in their modified <code>gethostbyname2</code> for backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Regarding configuration files, <code>getaddrinfo</code> will consult <code>/etc/gai.conf</code>

<p>By Joe Byerly<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-box-3"></span></p>
<p>Anyone who has worked directly for a battalion commander or above probably has experience writing “ghost notes.” These are emails a subordinate writes and addresses for their boss to send to other people. Ghost notes can be weekly or monthly sitreps, updates on an ongoing situation or emails asking for additional resources. No matter the type, they are the “easy button” for the commander because all they have to do is hit “send.”</p>
<p>Recently, I worked for a senior Army leader who encouraged his subordinate commanders to own their communications—meaning, write their own emails. As I reflected on his guidance, I realized there are benefits to communications ownership. I witnessed many of these benefits firsthand as I watched him communicate with senior military leaders, senior civilian leaders and his own commanders.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>

<p><strong>Greatness and Writing</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to work through a problem is to write it down. Throughout history, leaders who found themselves in tough situations sat alone with their thoughts and worked through them using pen and paper.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, who served as Roman emperor for almost two decades, wrote his <em>Meditations</em> to work through daily leadership challenges, wars and a pandemic. In the week leading up to the D-Day landings, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower wrote himself letters to help work through risks, opportunities and necessities of operations.</p>
<p>Both Marcus and Eisenhower used writing to achieve clarity of thought. This point is underscored by author Stephen King, who has said writing is “refined thinking.” In our minds, our thoughts are clear, but real clarity doesn’t come until those thoughts are solidified in writing. The process of framing an email, capturing important points and discarding nonessential elements helps us gain more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Authentic</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I have worked under multiple commanders while in staff positions, and the best ones never let me draft their intent for operations orders. They wanted to own those. At the time, I didn’t understand it—thinking it was one more staff drill I could handle for them. But as I gained experience, I realized they wanted that section of the operations order to reflect their voice.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-box-4"></span></p>
<p>We all have a voice when we write. This voice is our certificate of authenticity. When commanders write their own correspondence, their voice comes through. When someone else drafts an email, using words and phrases the commander wouldn’t normally use, others can tell someone else wrote it.</p>
<p>Authenticity in communications is important for two reasons. First, subordinates will know if the intent, the guidance, the policy, etc., is the commander’s, or if it is another product produced by staff. They are more likely to follow it and adhere to it when they know it comes directly from the commander’s mind and is not a draft by a random staff officer.</p>
<p>Also, commanders who write their own communications tend to reinforce the message by repeating what they wrote. The senior Army leader I worked for occasionally wrote guidance that he sent out in an email. He then repeated key words and phrases from the document in meetings, during battlefield circulation and in one-on-one discussions. Everyone knew he wrote the email because he owned it and talked about it; his guidance didn’t become memorandums left on a bulletin board in a headquarters.</p>
<p>The second reason authenticity in communications is important is that it signals leader involvement in an issue. I have learned that many senior leaders can tell when a subordinate commander’s email is authentic or a staff-produced ghost note.</p>
<p>Every time there was a change or inflection point in the strategic situation, my boss would provide a one- or two-page update to his commanders. He always wrote these himself, for the reasons mentioned above. I found out from those commanders’ staff members that their bosses read these emails because they knew it was from him, and that if he took the time to write it, they should take the time to read it.</p>
<p>Communication can be frustrating. Sometimes it is like tapping out a song you have in your head and expecting another person to immediately know the tune. It is hard to convey an idea in your head to someone who may not have the same background or experiences as you, or who wasn’t in the same room when you had a conversation.</p>
<p>Communication is a skill that takes practice. We need repetition. Leaders who write their own emails gain needed communication experience when it matters. I have also learned that speed comes with practice. I can write in hours what used to take days.</p>
<p><strong>Honing the Skill</strong></p>
<p>I recognize that commanders have a lot on their plates, and it isn’t feasible for them to spend hours writing and responding to emails. There are many ghost notes best produced by staff in the interest of time. However, when it comes to communicating up or down the chain of command on key issues, or writing guidance on important topics, it is best for commanders to own those.</p>
<p>Great leaders are also great communicators, but the ability to communicate effectively and efficiently takes time to develop. By owning communications, commanders refine and hone this skill. They also have an opportunity to work through problems and refine their thinking through the process of writing. Finally, they gain authenticity in their communications—an important factor in ensuring that “message sent” is “message received.”</p>

<p>Haskell programmers spend a lot of time talking about <em>type safety</em>. The Haskell school of program construction advocates “capturing invariants in the type system” and “making illegal states unrepresentable,” both of which sound like compelling goals, but are rather vague on the techniques used to achieve them. Almost exactly one year ago, I published <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, Don’t Validate</a> as an initial stab towards bridging that gap.</p>

<p>The ensuing discussions were largely productive and right-minded, but one particular source of confusion quickly became clear: Haskell’s <code>newtype</code> construct. The idea is simple enough—the <code>newtype</code> keyword declares a wrapper type, nominally distinct from but representationally equivalent to the type it wraps—and on the surface this <em>sounds</em> like a simple and straightforward path to type safety. For example, one might consider using a <code>newtype</code> declaration to define a type for an email address:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>Text</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This technique can provide <em>some</em> value, and when coupled with a smart constructor and an encapsulation boundary, it can even provide some safety. But it is a meaningfully distinct <em>kind</em> of type safety from the one I highlighted a year ago, one that is far weaker. On its own, a newtype is just a name.</p>

<p>And names are not type safety.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>To illustrate the difference between constructive data modeling (discussed at length in my <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/08/13/types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types/">previous blog post</a>) and newtype wrappers, let’s consider an example. Suppose we want a type for “an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.” The natural constructive modeling would be an enumeration with five cases:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>One</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Two</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Three</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Four</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Five</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>We could then write some functions to convert between <code>Int</code> and our <code>OneToFive</code> type:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>One</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>2</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Two</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Three</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>4</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Four</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Five</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This would be perfectly sufficient for achieving our stated goal, but you’d be forgiven for finding it odd: it would be rather awkward to work with in practice. Because we’ve invented an entirely new type, we can’t reuse any of the usual numeric functions Haskell provides. Consequently, many programmers would gravitate towards a newtype wrapper, instead:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>=</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>Int</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as before, we can provide <code>toOneToFive</code> and <code>fromOneToFive</code> functions, with identical types:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span>        <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>(</span><span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If we put these declarations in their own module and choose not to export the <code>OneToFive</code> constructor, these APIs might appear entirely interchangeable. Naïvely, it seems that the newtype version is both simpler and equally type-safe. However—perhaps surprisingly—this is not actually true.</p>

<p>To see why, suppose we write a function that consumes a <code>OneToFive</code> value as an argument. Under the constructive modeling, such a function need only pattern-match against each of the five constructors, and GHC will accept the definition as exhaustive:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"first"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"second"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>"third"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The same is not true given the newtype encoding. The newtype is opaque, so the only way to observe it is to convert it back to an <code>Int</code>—after all, it <em>is</em> an <code>Int</code>. An <code>Int</code> can of course contain many other values besides <code>1</code> through <code>5</code>, so we are forced to add an error case to satisfy the exhaustiveness checker:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>n</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"first"</span>
  <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"second"</span>
  <span>3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"third"</span>
  <span>4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
  <span>5</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
  <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: bad OneToFive value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this highly contrived example, this may not seem like much of a problem to you. But it nonetheless illustrates a key difference in the guarantees afforded by the two approaches:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The constructive datatype captures its invariants in such a way that they are <em>accessible</em> to downstream consumers. This frees our <code>ordinal</code> function from worrying about handling illegal values, as they have been made unutterable.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The newtype wrapper provides a smart constructor that <em>validates</em> the value, but the boolean result of that check is used only for control flow; it is not preserved in the function’s result. Accordingly, downstream consumers cannot take advantage of the restricted domain; they are functionally accepting <code>Int</code>s.</p></li></ul>

<p>Losing exhaustiveness checking might seem like small potatoes, but it absolutely is not: our use of <code>error</code> has punched a hole right through our type system. If we were to add another constructor to our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype,<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> the version of <code>ordinal</code> that consumes a constructive datatype would be immediately detected non-exhaustive at compile-time, while the version that consumes a newtype wrapper would continue to compile yet fail at runtime, dropping through to the “impossible” case.</p>

<p>All of this is a consequence of the fact that the constructive modeling is <em>intrinsically</em> type-safe; that is, the safety properties are enforced by the type declaration itself. Illegal values truly are unrepresentable: there is simply no way to represent <code>6</code> using any of the five constructors. The same is not true of the newtype declaration, which has no intrinsic semantic distinction from that of an <code>Int</code>; its meaning is specified extrinsically via the <code>toOneToFive</code> smart constructor. Any semantic distinction intended by a newtype is thoroughly invisible to the type system; it exists only in the programmer’s mind.</p>

<p>Our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype is rather artificial, but identical reasoning applies to other datatypes that are significantly more practical. Consider the <code>NonEmpty</code> datatype I’ve repeatedly highlighted in recent blog posts:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>It may be illustrative to imagine a version of <code>NonEmpty</code> represented as a newtype over ordinary lists. We can use the usual smart constructor strategy to enforce the desired non-emptiness property:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Foldable</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>toList</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as with <code>OneToFive</code>, we quickly discover the consequences of failing to preserve this information in the type system. Our motivating use case for <code>NonEmpty</code> was the ability to write a safe version of <code>head</code>, but the newtype version requires another assertion:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>toList</span> <span>xs</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>[]</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This might not seem like a big deal, since it seems unlikely such a case would ever happen. But that reasoning hinges entirely on trusting the correctness of the module that defines <code>NonEmpty</code>, while the constructive definition only requires trusting the GHC typechecker. As we generally trust that the typechecker works correctly, the latter is a much more compelling proof.</p>



<p>If you are fond of newtypes, this whole argument may seem a bit troubling. It may seem like I’m implying newtypes are scarcely better than comments, albeit comments that happen to be meaningful to the typechecker. Fortunately, the situation is not quite that grim—newtypes <em>can</em> provide a sort of safety, just a weaker one.</p>

<p>The primary safety benefit of newtypes is derived from abstraction boundaries. If a newtype’s constructor is not exported, it becomes opaque to other modules. The module that defines the newtype—its “home module”—can take advantage of this to create a <em>trust boundary</em> where internal invariants are enforced by restricting clients to a safe API.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>NonEmpty</code> example from above to illustrate how this works. We refrain from exporting the <code>NonEmpty</code> constructor, and we provide <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> operations that we trust to never actually fail:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>module</span> <span>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</span>
  <span>(</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>cons</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>nonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>head</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>tail</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span>
<span>cons</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>    <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>

<span>tail</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>     <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Since the only way to construct or consume <code>NonEmpty</code> values is to use the functions in <code>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</code>’s exported API, the above implementation makes it impossible for clients to violate the non-emptiness invariant. In a sense, values of opaque newtypes are like <em>tokens</em>: the implementing module issues tokens via its constructor functions, and those tokens have no intrinsic value. The only way to do anything useful with them is to “redeem” them to the issuing module’s accessor functions, in this case <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, to obtain the values contained within.</p>

<p>This approach is significantly weaker than using a constructive datatype, since it is theoretically possible to screw up and accidentally provide a means to construct an invalid <code>NonEmpty []</code> value. For this reason, the newtype approach to type safety does not on its own constitute a <em>proof</em> that a desired invariant holds. However, it restricts the “surface area” where an invariant violation can occur to the defining module, so reasonable confidence the invariant really does hold can be achieved by thoroughly testing the module’s API using fuzzing or property-based testing techniques.<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup></p>

            </p> <div data-v-154a69ab=""><p>hat November evening, the people of Charkhi Dadri town, about 100km west of Delhi, were done with the day’s work out in the fields. Some of them heard the sky detonate with thunder and erupt into flames. On the ground, doors and windows crumbled. Glass shards flew through the air.</p><p>Mistaking it for an earthquake, residents streamed out of their homes, only to find over 500 tonnes of material pouring out from the sky—what an <em>India Today</em> story vividly described as “the equivalent of 600 Maruti cars”. The planes plunged into the mustard and cotton fields, miraculously hitting no one on the ground. There were rumours of a few survivors found in the wreckage, but none were ever brought to a hospital.&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>At about 9pm, as Prannoy Roy finished reading for <em>The News Tonight</em>, the daily English bulletin on Doordarshan, wire services broke the story of a mid-air collision just outside Delhi. Most journalists had already left for the day, and the crowd at the studios of NDTV, a private news production company, was thinning. Writer and film-maker Natasha Badhwar, then a 25-year-old cameraperson two years out of Jamia Millia Islamia University, quickly volunteered herself for the story. Along with reporter Radhika Bordia and camera assistant Kanan Patra, she got into an office vehicle and headed towards Charkhi Dadri. As they approached the site, they saw a massive inferno raging in the distance, ringed by smaller fires. </p><p>They got out of the car and began to walk through the debris and darkness. When Badhwar struck something, the group stopped and switched on the camera light. A stiff body swam into view, dead, but not burnt or broken. The man looked in death as he might have in life. How do you film a dead body, Badhwar wondered. “There was a sense of horror I could not shut out,” she said. “There was a sense of incredulity: How could this happen? How could two planes collide?”</p><p>Through the night, journalists arrived to scenes of damage and disarray. Passports, bags of food, toys, slippers, wallets, wrenched-open suitcases and airplane seats were flung around. Disembodied human limbs lay scattered like confetti. The full horror would not be apparent until sunrise, but the acrid stench of burning fuselage and singed remains had already begun choking the air.</p><p>At one point, the grandson of a prominent politician waltzed in,<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="2pzmabfu9t5s">[4]</sup></a> chaperoned by a group of sidekicks and handlers. He had no reason to be there but quickly became the centre of attention. When asked what he was doing there, he smarmily replied, “Plane curiosity.”&nbsp;</p><p>Through the night, villagers tried to find survivors as emergency services arrived. By the morning, several bodies were moved into a school which had been converted to a makeshift morgue. Debris had scattered over a radius of several kilometres, complicating search and rescue operations. </p><p>KPS Nair was among the first team of investigators and diplomats to reach the scene as dawn broke. Then a Deputy Director with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Nair had been in a meeting on air safety when news filtered in the previous evening. The irony was inescapable. “My first thought was, my god!” he recalled over the phone in June 2020. “Why do such things happen in spite of the efforts of human beings to make better flying machines and systems?”</p><p>As lead investigator, his first impulse was to locate the “black boxes”, vermilion-coloured crash-proof casings that held the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR). The CVR, which saved the last 30 minutes of cockpit conversation, could provide precious insight into what the crew had said to each other. The FDR would provide readings on altitude, speed, flight path and engine power to help build a picture of both planes’ vital parameters. “This,” Nair explained, “is the most important tool in the hands of an investigator from the accident site.”</p><div data-v-154a69ab=""><p>Both black boxes were found before nightfall on the day following the accident. The cockpit of the Saudi aircraft was stuck deeper in the ground, irrevocably damaged, none of its instruments readable. All three of its altimeters were destroyed in the fire.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kazakh plane had suffered less damage and yielded four altimeters. Two of them, curiously, showed different readings: 4,443m (14,576 feet) and 4,540m (14,895 feet). The other two were unreadable.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Nair scoured the fields, analysing the debris scattered across two sites seven kilometres apart, searching for clues in the carcasses of the two planes. “We approach any accident with an open mind,” he said. “We ask, did everyone involved apply the necessary procedures? The contributing factors we look at include the ATC communications, pilot error, engineering and maintenance aspects.” </p><p>AK Chopra, then head of air safety for the North region at the DGCA, also reached the site with his team. Chopra sensed something puzzling, even counter-intuitive. The frontal structure of the Kazakh flight was mostly intact, which indicated that this hadn’t been a head-on collision. If the Kazakh plane was supposed to have been higher (15,000 feet), why did a primary assessment suggest that it had hit the Saudi plane from below? </p><p>By mid-afternoon, just 19 bodies had been claimed from the morgue. Rescue workers tried to pick through the debris, retrieving limbs and luggage. Badhwar even encountered the studio in-charge from Jamia’s Mass Communication Research Centre, mourning the loss of a younger brother who had been on the flight.&nbsp;</p><p>For at least 15 hours after the crash, there was little sense of sanctity about the site, which was only cordoned off much later.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="z5s3bz6hivmy">[5]</sup></a> Some people rifled through the wreckage and corpses, trying to make off with the spoils. But for the most part, people were kind and helpful, bringing sheets from their homes for the bodies, volunteering tractors in search efforts, and offering tea to families. </p><p>Over time, the horror of losing a loved one morphed into the numbing pain of dealing with paperwork. Relatives scrambling to apply for compensation and obtain death certificates shuttled from one office to another. The Saudis announced compensation of up to GBP 12,000 for the families of passengers, and some compensation<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="k4yf7bl2nlj4">[6]</sup></a> for the villagers in whose fields the flights had crashed.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, 94 bodies were charred beyond recognition or totally mutilated. They lay piled up in the morgue, their limbs on ice. Many of the dead were from mofussil areas. Their families would hear about the tragedy only much later, particularly since some didn’t even know their relatives were on board.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="xjunwbq7ccht">[7]</sup></a> Others, perhaps, never found out at all, given the underhand manner in which agents and touts recruited people for jobs abroad.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="am1u2ycez0x2">[8]</sup></a></p><p>After 15 days in the morgue, the unclaimed bodies were divided in proportion to the Hindus and Muslims on board according to the passenger manifest, a compromise between community leaders following an initial dispute. First, everyone went to the Muslim burial ground; later they went to the crematorium. Badhwar, still processing the disaster she had covered, attended the mass funerals and filmed them. “The smell of burning flesh still haunted me,” she said. “I felt I had some undone mourning to do.”</p></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s in words that the magic is—Abracadabra, Open Sesame, and the rest—but the magic words in one story aren’t magical in the next.
The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what; the trick is to learn the trick.</p>

<p>It’s been quite some time since Hooks were officially stabilized in <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React 16.8</a>, and with them came a fundamentally different way of understanding the way our applications work.
This is both a blessing and a curse: Hooks are much closer to the React programming model and help avoid a certain class of subtle and confusing bugs, but some developers have also expressed concerns that <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/blog/react-is-becoming-a-black-box" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React is becoming a black box</a>.
These concerns are completely valid; Hooks can often seem “magical,” since most of the complexities are hidden away in React’s internals.</p>
<p>Much of that “magical” feeling is simply due to the fact that Hooks are based on some <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#what-is-the-prior-art-for-hooks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">prior art</a> and programming language research that many developers simply aren’t familiar with.
Understanding some of the motivations and inspirations for Hooks can help build a mental model for what’s happening behind the scenes.
While there are several sources of influence on the original Hooks proposal, arguably the most important is the notion of algebraic effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❗❗ Note that this article is <em>not</em> an introduction into how to <em>use</em> Hooks or how Hooks work internally.
This is merely a way to <em>think</em> about Hooks. For more information about how to use them, I suggest
starting with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before diving into the details of algebraic effects, let’s first take a step back.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-hooks"><a href="#why-do-we-need-hooks" aria-label="why do we need hooks permalink"></a>Why Do We Need Hooks?</h2>
<p>Class components seemed to be working well enough, why add <em>another</em> way of writing components that, at least at face value, do the same thing?</p>
<p><img src="https://reesew.io/media/DysfunctionalClassComponents.png" alt="First tweet by @rickhanlonii: &quot;The existence of functional components implies the existence of dysfunctional components&quot;. Reply tweet by @sebmarkbage: &quot;We call those 'class components'.&quot;"></p>
<p>One of React’s core principles is the idea that an application’s user interface is a pure function of that application’s state.
Here, “state” can refer to any combination of local component state and global state, such as a Redux store.
When that state changes and propagates through your component tree, the output represents your new UI after that state change.
This is, of course, an abstraction over the nuts and bolts of how that update actually happens, since React handles the actual reconciliation and DOM updates that are necessary, but this core principle means, at least in theory, that our UI is always synchronized with our data.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t always true.
Class components expose certain scenarios that allow us to ignore changes in state if we don’t effectively handle those state changes in our lifecycle methods.
Dan Abramov wrote an <a href="https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/#dont-stop-the-data-flow-in-side-effects" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">excellent article</a> on some common pitfalls related to this that’s worth a read for more detail.
In short, class components use different lifecycle methods to handle side effects, but that maps side effects to DOM operations, <em>not</em> state changes.
This means that while the visual elements of our UI may respond to state changes, our side effects might not.</p>
<p>Because class components have to do these internal updates to synchronize their internal state when props change, they are by definition <em>impure</em>.
<em>But wait</em>, you say, <em>I thought we said that UI was a <em>pure</em> function of state</em>.</p>
<p><em>Precisely</em>.
This is where Hooks come into play.</p>
<p>Hooks represent a different way of thinking about effects.
Instead of thinking about the entire lifecycle of a component, Hooks allow us to narrow our focus to only the current state.
We can then <em>declare</em> the states in which we want our effects to run, ensuring that those state changes are reflected in our effects.
Of course, an “effect” can be many things, from handling state with <code>useState</code>, making network requests or manually updating the DOM with <code>useEffect</code>, or calculating expensive callback functions with <code>useCallback</code>.</p>
<p>But how do we reason about those side effects within a pure function?
I’m glad you asked!</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-to-algebraic-effects"><a href="#an-introduction-to-algebraic-effects" aria-label="an introduction to algebraic effects permalink"></a>An Introduction to Algebraic Effects</h2>
<p><em>Algebraic effects</em> are a generalized approach to reasoning about computational effects in pure contexts by defining an <em>effect</em>, a set of operations, and an effect <em>handler</em>, which is responsible for handling the semantics of how to implement effects.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>
Algebraic effects generalize over a whole host of potential uses, like input and output, handling state, <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, and many more.</p>
<p>This is a little abstract, so let’s write some code to see how this works in practice.
Unfortunately, JavaScript doesn’t actually support algebraic effects, although React might mimic them internally.
While there are a few different languages<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> that support algebraic effects, we’re going to use <a href="https://github.com/matijapretnar/eff" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eff</a>, a functional programming language designed specifically around algebraic effects.
Don’t worry, <em>most</em> people won’t know Eff, so I’ll explain some syntax as we go along<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A common use case for algebraic effects is handling stateful computations.
Remember that effects are just in an interface with a set of operations.
In Eff, we defined effects with the <code>effect</code> keyword and a type signature:</p>
<!---
I'm using OCaml tags in the markdown here because there's obviously
no highlighting options for Eff.
-->
<div data-language="ocaml"><pre><code>


<span>type</span> user <span>=</span> string <span>*</span> int

effect <span>Get</span><span>:</span> user
effect <span>Set</span><span>:</span> user <span>-&gt;</span> unit</code></pre></div>
<p>Once we’ve defined what effects our effects will look like, we can define how our effects are handled by using the <code>handler</code> keyword.</p>
<div data-language="ocaml"><pre><code><span>let</span> state <span>=</span> handler
  <span>|</span> y <span>-&gt;</span> <span>fun</span> currentState <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span>y<span>,</span> currentState<span>)</span>
  <span>|</span> effect <span>Get</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> currentState <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span>continue k currentState<span>)</span> currentState<span>)</span>
  <span>|</span> effect <span>(</span><span>Set</span> newState<span>)</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span>continue k <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> newState<span>)</span>
<span>;</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Hmm, this looks a little trickier — let’s break it down a bit.
We have a <code>handler</code> with three branches, and all of them return a function.
That function will be used to handle some effect (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>The first branch, <code>y -&gt; fun currentState -&gt; (y, currentState)</code>, represents <em>no</em> effect, which happens when we reach the end of the block we’re handling (which we’ll see shortly). <code>y</code> here is the return value of the function, so this simply returns a tuple of the inner return and the state.</p>
<p>The second and third branches match our effects, but there’s a suspicious argument <code>k</code>.
<code>k</code> here is a <em>continuation</em>, which represents the rest of the computation <em>after</em> where we perform an effect.</p>
<div><p>GOTO, but better</p><div><blockquote>
<p>At my heart, I am something like the goto instruction; my creation sets the label, and my methods do the jump. However, this is a really powerful kind of goto instruction. If your hair is turning green at this point, don’t worry as you will probably only deal with users of continuations, rather than with the concept itself.</p>
</blockquote><p>This little gem comes from the GNU Smalltalk <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual-base/html_node/Continuation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Continuation</code> documentation</a>.
For some of you, the reference to <code>GOTO</code> might make you a little nauseated, but there’s a reason that continuations still have their place as a control flow, which is about <em>context</em>.
One of the more treacherous aspects of <code>GOTO</code> is getting plopped into an invalid context, but with continuations, you’re really storing an in-flight <em>process</em>, so the variables, pointers, and so on will all be valid.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p></div></div>
<p>Because continuations represent the entire process in action, they’re essentially a snapshot of the call stack at the time of the effect.
When we get to an effect, it’s almost as if we hit a giant pause button on the computation until we properly handle the effect.
Calling <code>continue k</code><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> is like hitting the play button again.</p>
<p>Alright, I think we’re ready to see our effect handlers in action.
Right now, we have a user in state; let’s wish them well on their birthday:</p>
<div data-language="ocaml"><pre><code><span>let</span> celebrate <span>=</span> <span>with</span> state handle
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span>name<span>,</span> age<span>)</span> <span>=</span> perform <span>Get</span> <span>in</span>

  print<span>_</span>string <span>"Happy Birthday, "</span><span>;</span>
  print<span>_</span>string name<span>;</span>
  print<span>_</span>endline <span>"!"</span><span>;</span>

  perform <span>(</span><span>Set</span> <span>(</span>name<span>,</span> age<span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  perform <span>Get</span>
<span>;</span><span>;</span>

celebrate<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>"Henry"</span><span>,</span> <span>39</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we start off this computation, we first <code>Get</code> our user from state, which runs the second branch in our handler.
At this point, we’ve hit the pause button, so the function has stopped running while we get this from state.
The handler gives us back a function, which calls <code>continue k currentState</code>, resuming our computation with the value of <code>currentState</code>.</p>
<p>This same flow happens every time we <code>perform</code> an effect.
Hit pause, do some work, hit play.</p>
<p><img src="https://reesew.io/media/CelebrateToBeContinued.png" alt="Our code for the celebrate function, overlaid with the &quot;To Be Continued&quot; meme from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure."></p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<figcaption>I'm so sorry</figcaption>
<p>And here, dear reader, is where the power of algebraic effects really shines.
You see, it doesn’t really <em>matter</em> how we hold state.
Sure, right now it’s just an object in memory, but what if it was in a database?
What if it was stored in a browser’s <code>localStorage</code>?
As far as <code>celebrate</code> knows, these are <em>all the same</em>.
If we wanted, we could swap out our <code>state</code> handler with a <code>redisState</code> handler that stored state in a key-value store.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, your code has to be aware of what’s synchronous and what’s not.
If this were to change in the future, and state was handled asynchronously, we would need to start handling Promises, which would require changes across <em>everything</em> that touches this function.
But with algebraic effects, instead of maintaining a running process that holds a reference to a <em>different</em> process, we can simply stop the current process altogether until our effects are finished.</p>
<p>Of course, state isn’t the only thing that we can handle with algebraic effects.
Let’s say we have some network request we want to make or cleanup we want to execute, but we only want to do it <em>after</em> our function is done.
We’ll call it a <code>Defer</code> effect.</p>
<div data-language="ocaml"><pre><code>effect <span>Defer</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span>unit <span>-&gt;</span> unit<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> unit

<span>let</span> defer <span>=</span> handler
    <span>|</span> y <span>-&gt;</span> <span>fun</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span> effect <span>(</span><span>Defer</span> effectFunc<span>)</span> k <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
            continue k <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
            effectFunc <span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span>
<span>;</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that <code>continue k ()</code> doesn’t have to be the last part of the handler, as it was in our <code>state</code> handler.
We can call continuations <em>whenever</em> we want and however many times we want — remember, they’re just representations of a process.</p>
<p>To make sure this works as intended, let’s make a quick sketch of how this might work in practice:</p>
<div data-language="ocaml"><pre><code><span>let</span> runWithCleanup <span>=</span> <span>with</span> defer handle
    print<span>_</span>endline <span>"Starting our computation"</span><span>;</span>
    perform <span>(</span><span>Defer</span> <span>fun</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> print<span>_</span>endline <span>"Running cleanup"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    print<span>_</span>endline <span>"Finishing computation"</span>
<span>;</span><span>;</span>

runWithCleanup<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we run this, we get the following in our terminal:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code>$ eff defer.eff</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>Last updated: November 01, 2020<br>

<p>Winamp has remained a firm favourite for many tech geeks and music lovers alike. It had appeared to lose its way for a while, as it was slow in coming forward with newer versions, which could be supported by more modern software. This all looks set to change and could be the revival that Winamp truly deserves. The new update, BETA version 5.8, seems to have found its way onto the internet, hinting that this could be a step towards this fan favourite being supported by Windows 10. Although its Belgian owners, Radionomy, are yet to make a formal release statement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Winamp-Windows-101.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Winamp-Windows-101-300x225.jpg" alt="Download Winamp for Windows 10" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Winamp-Windows-101-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Winamp-Windows-101.jpg 1024w, http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Winamp-Windows-101-541x406.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Support for Windows Audio seems to be one of the key developments and this change allows for complete compatibility with Windows 10. No doubt, it will have the usual teething problems, but as has been shown before, it’s the fans and enthusiasts who have helped to push the software in the right direction when it comes to tweaks and apps. Winamp has launched their own forum for just this purpose and it’s great to see fans new and old being able to discuss both their excitement and, as to be expected at this early stage, some of their frustrations.</p>
<p>The goal of this new set of developers has been clearly defined as, the intention to make Winamp the player of today and provide an up to date and complete listening experience. One of the best things they’ve done so far is to remove any old pro licences, making Winamp 100% free to use again. There are also some other current fixes which have been included in the new version, these fixes include, resolved – slow loading issue, improved – updated scroll bar and buttons, fixed – various memory leaks. There are tons more additions and you can see the complete list of updates, fixes and resolutions within the new BETA version.</p>
<p>The go-to functions of customisable skins, visualisation, plugins and the ability to design and make your media player unique to you, are all still high on the agenda and remain some of the software’s key features. The fact that it can now be supported by Windows 10 has also opened up other new avenues. There are more advanced video plugins which can now be supported whereas previously there were some issues with this. There is no multinational version available with Lang packs as yet, but they’re working on the language packs, with Spanish and Polish currently available on the BETA version.</p>
<p>For more avid users of Winamp, they’ll be pleased to know the CD playback and ripping functions now use native Windows API instead of Sonic. The AAC decoder now uses Media foundation, Vista and higher and the H.264 decoder is now also using Media foundation, Vista and higher. These technical changes demonstrate that Winamp is taking itself seriously and has finally understood there is still a huge legion of fans who will willingly support and promote this unequalled media player. There is still nothing as flexible, yet as technically delightful as Winamp when it comes to creating and building your own individual home for music.</p>
<p>Back in October 2018, Radionomy’s CEO, Alexandre Saboundjan hinted that we could expect to see a version 6 available in 2019. 5 months into the year there have been no further corporate updates, including whether or not it will be able to support newer services or how it might integrate with the big players such as Apple Music and Spotify. However, the fact that the owners of Winamp are starting to understand the true potential behind this awesome media player can surely be nothing but good a sign for hardcore Winamp enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The beauty of Winamp is that you experience all of your music in a single place and this makes it a singular experience. There’s no need to go switching between platforms and getting lost in remembering where dedicated playlists are saved. The visualization aspect of Winamp and its spectrum analyser has always allowed people to bring their music to life. To see and feel it. It’s fantastic to see the BETA version available, and the input this is allowing fans and users alike to generate.</p>
<p>We’ve touched on some of the updates but there are a few others that deserve a mention. You can slow down the pop-up buttons, so they don’t overtake the screen and they’ve also improved the browse path and edit title functions in Editor. The OpenMPT-base module player has also been improved and they’ve replaced the MikMod player. The added functionality which can now be supported by Windows 10 is set to continue and we can expect to see more and advances over the coming months.</p>
<p>With only the BETA version being released so far, it’s safe to say, this is a work in progress, but I for one look forward to being a part of the continuing journey to restoring Winamp to its former and well-deserved glory.</p>
<p>Here you can find the Winamp for Windows 10 (Windows media player) with contain required update patches. Windows 10 had backward compatibility with Winamp skins and popular plugins. Compatibility Winamp updates for security&nbsp;support are have already installed. Winamp works perfectly well with Windows 10.</p>

  <div><p>The web has a long and rich history dating back to the nineties at CERN. Back then <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> laid the foundation of HTML that is still around today. There have been attempts to replace it with varying success but none have been successful, for good reason. HTML and the later invention of CSS are a remarkably powerful set of tools to build all kinds of experiences on the web. People are still trying to replace HTML, which brings us to the topic of this post: Flutter Web.</p>

<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/web">Flutter Web</a> is part of Google’s <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> framework for building cross platform UI. Hailed by many developers as the best thing since sliced bread, my opinion of it lacks the rose coloured glasses. I haven’t looked at Flutter for other platforms than web so I cannot comment on it other than that the general principle of Flutter is a terrible idea. Flutter works by throwing away the native UI toolkits provided by the platform and rendering everything from scratch using OpenGL et al. This translates extremely poorly to the web platform in particular. It’s worth noting that Flutter for Web is currently in beta and the problems I am about to detail could be addressed. However, I believe these issues are fundamental to Flutter’s design choices so I feel confident in my criticism.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-html">Semantic HTML</h2>

<p>Anyone learning HTML these days would have encountered the term “Semantic HTML” because it is such an important part of modern web. <a href="https://www.petelambert.com/">Pete Lambert</a> describes why this is important in the excellent blog post <a href="https://www.petelambert.com/journal/html-is-the-web">HTML is the Web</a>. In short, the visible portion of a website, i.e. presentation, is only half the story. To take an example Pete used, a <code>div</code> with an <code>onClick</code> handler might be clickable and can be styled to look like a button, but that doesn’t make it a button. The semantic structure of a document matters because that’s how machines, not humans, understand the web. A <code>div</code> with an <code>onClick</code> handler doesn’t look like a link or a button to a screen reader, search engine crawler, or accessibility extension, it looks like a <code>div</code>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, semantic HTML is key for accessibility and other tools that let a user experience the web as they wish.</p>

<h2 id="a-fractal-of-bad-design">A Fractal of Bad Design</h2>

<p>Does Flutter Web generate semantic HTML? Not even close. It generates a patchwork of <code>canvas</code> elements, custom elements, and a few other HTML elements. In the demo app <a href="https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/reply">Reply</a>, how many buttons and links are there? If you guessed <strong>zero</strong>, congratulations you are as jaded and cynical as me. Let me reiterate that, an email app with no buttons and links! Because there are no links in particular, features like cmd/ctrl clicking to open a new tab, hovering links to see the URL, and using the context menu do not work.</p>

<p>I use the browser extension <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a> to navigate the web, it’s an amazingly powerful tool that relies on, you guessed it, semantic HTML. Does it work on pages built with Flutter Web? Fuck no. It doesn’t work because it tries to find things that are semantically clickable, like <code>button</code> or <code>a</code> elements, of which, as we have established, Flutter Web generates none. Vimium works on almost all websites I use because most developers, thankfully, don’t just stick <code>onClick</code> handlers on <code>div</code>s. However, whatever crazy shit Flutter Web does, doesn’t look clickable. Things being clickable that don’t look clickable is a good proxy for poor accessibility. For example, screen readers can navigate by landmarks, such as headings, <strong>links</strong>, forms, and other semantic elements, does any of this work with Flutter Web? Fuck no.</p>

<p>Even worse, unless you use special “selectable” text, Flutter Web doesn’t even support selecting text. No joke, their own code examples have a “copy all” button to get around this.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/code-example.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/code-example.png?1604348346" alt="Screenshot of Flutter's Navigation Bar component with preview, code, and &quot;copy all&quot; button"></a></p>

<p>How did anyone look at this and say “yeah nah, selecting text isn’t an important use case on the web”? Why does selecting text matter you ask? Some people use it to aid with reading by selecting the text they are currently reading, other people use it to(and I know this is wild) copy parts of the text, people with dyslexia use tools that read out selected portions of the text to help them read. Does any of this work with Flutter’s default, unselectable text? Fuck no!</p>

<p>While we are talking about dyslexia, another useful feature that help people who suffer from it is the ability to change the fonts of web pages to one they find easier to read, such as <a href="https://www.opendyslexic.org/">OpenDyslexic</a>. There are many tools that help with this and they all rely on the ability to inject custom CSS in a web page, to my surprise this actually looked to work when I tried it on some of the Flutter Web demos. However, looks deceive and while the font does apply it causes text to get cut off in almost all instances because of the terrible HTML Flutter generates. For example, in the “Reply” email client here’s the tag for the word “Reply” in the upper right</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal; font-family: WorkSans_regular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); letter-spacing: 0px; position: absolute; white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow: hidden; height: 27px; width: 54px; transform-origin: 0px 0px 0px; transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 59, 3.5); left: 0px; top: 0px;"</span><span>&gt;</span>REPLY<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Cleaned up a bit and these are the attributes</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">font-size: 18px;
font-weight: normal;
font-family: WorkSans_regular, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
letter-spacing: 0px;
position: absolute;
white-space: pre-wrap;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
overflow: hidden;
height: 27px;
width: 54px;
transform-origin: 0px 0px 0px;
transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 59, 3.5);
left: 0px;
top: 0px;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Flutter Web generates absolutely positioned fixed sized HTML which instead of adopting to the text layout specified by the browser just cuts the text off.</p>

<p>Another useful feature that is common in accessibility extensions is making links stand out more. This works by injecting global CSS rules that target <code>a</code> tags on the page.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/link-underlines.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/link-underlines.png?1604348346" alt="Screenshot of links with link emphasis turned on which underlines them in multiple colours"></a></p>

<p>Does this work with Flutter Web (this questions is starting to feel redundant because the answer is almost always “No”)? Fuck no! In general, users use custom stylesheets for a multitude of reasons not limited to accessibility. As a “fun” exercise try this <a href="https://ssb22.user.srcf.net/css/">low vision stylesheet</a> on one of the <a href="https://gallery.flutter.dev/">Flutter Web demos</a> and see how readable the content is.</p>

<p>Another one of the <a href="https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/fortnightly">demos</a> in the Flutter Web Gallery is a news site. On news sites, I like to use the built-in “reader mode” in my browser to get a reading experience that is free from clutter and better suites me. For example, when reading in bed late at night (which I know I shouldn’t do) it’s nice to have a soft, dark mode experience instead of the glaring black text on pure white that many publications use. Does reader mode work with Flutter Web website? Nope. It doesn’t work because, you guessed it, it relies on semantic HTML.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/enable-accessibility.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design/enable-accessibility.png?1604348346" alt="Screenshot of Firefox accessibility inspector showing a single button with the text &quot;Enable accessibility&quot;"></a></p>

<p>Like any good writer, I’ve saved the best for last: the screen reader experience with Flutter Web. When you first focus on  one of the Flutter Web demos with a screen reader you are greeted with a “button” that says “Enable accessibility”. Admittedly, when you click this button there is a resemblance of screen reader content but it’s terrible. In the “Reply” app things are read out with unnecessarily high detail in the list view, things that can be clicked aren’t identified as such, you cannot even get to the menu as far as I can tell, and as previously identified there are almost no landmarks which are used for navigation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Flutter is a misguided attempt to achieve the impossible: quality cross platform experiences. Flutter Web in particular is fundamentally flawed and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up if it has any hopes of being viable tech that generates semantic, accessible, and modern web experiences. I have serious doubt that when Flutter Web leaves beta any of this will be addressed properly, unless the whole approach is reconsidered. If you see Flutter Web, turn around and run in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Developers, designers, and product people all love cross platform solutions because it saves them time and energy while achieving the “same” outcome as the costlier alternatives. Flutter Web nicely illustrates that the outcomes aren’t the same, the visible part of a product is only one part of the puzzle.</p>

<p>I’m merely an accessibility novice and I didn’t even mention SEO in this post. I didn’t stop writing because I stopped finding flaws, but because this post was getting too long and I have other things to do. I’m sure accessibility users and experts can find even more issues than I have presented here(feel free to DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/k0nserv">Twitter</a> and I’ll include them).</p>

<p>To end I’d like to leave you with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNX6XJOeGU">quote</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/characters/nm0000156?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Dr. Ian Malcolm</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.</p>

E.g. I don’t need to know the quantum state of every single subatomic particle in a baseball in order to calculate how long it takes to reach the floor if I drop it. I need merely two variables (the downward acceleration caused by Earth’s gravitational field and the height from the ball to the floor), resulting in a simple yet accurate model. In highly complex systems such as business, things like butterfly effects can cause massive distortions rendering our models flawed. Pretending, as we (correctly) do in physics, that there’s a near-perfect bijection between our simple model and reality often causes major mistakes. We must caution against an over-reliance on numbers and the easily measurable because for us, the valuable and the (easily) measurable aren’t always synonymous. Until we have better models or are able to collect enough of the right data points (big and minute), it’s often preferable, as well as faster, to simply try things out on a small scale in the real world and use a feedback loop to iterate.</em></p><blockquote><p>The specific anticipative understanding of the conditions of the uncertain future defies any rules and systematization.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>What are ZK-SNARKs and how do they work? This is a question I’ve had for years, and always felt like the resources I found gave no clear intuition as to how all of that stuff worked. So today, after a breakthrough in my own understanding, I thought it would be good to re-share what I’ve learned in a more understandable picture. Something that tells you what is the right way of thinking about these things, and what are the gaps that you can fill for yourself if you want to.</p>
<h2>Getting terminology out of the way</h2>
<p>The first part of the question is pretty easy to answer. ZK-SNARKs, no matter what their funny name might imply, are simply <strong>zero-knowledge proofs</strong> that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>non interactive</strong></li>
<li><strong>general purpose</strong></li>
<li>and <strong>succinct</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Huh, what are all these words? you ask, intimidated by their vagueness.</p>
<p>Well first, <strong>zero-knowledge proofs</strong> are cryptographic proofs that you know something, without revealing the something (zero-knowledgeness). That “something” is usually called the <strong>witness</strong>, but this detail doesn’t matter much. There are a lot of resources about zero-knowledge proofs so I won’t explain much about how they work, or what their exact cryptographic properties are (completeness, soundness, zero-knowledgeness).
Zero-knowledge proofs are often seen used to prove that you know the discrete logarithm in some base of an element of some group (e.g. what is $x$ in $g^x \mod p$), or similarly-limited statements.<br>
“<em>Limited yes, but still useful!</em>” yells Schnorr, inventor of the Schnorr signature scheme which is fabricated by taking a zero-knowledge proof of the knowledge of a discrete logarithm, and making it <strong>non-interactive</strong>. A zero-knowledge proof or <strong>ZKP</strong> is an interactive protocol between a prover (who knows the <strong>witness</strong>) and a verifier (who has to be convinced). An interactive protocol sucks in the real world, as it often limits the number of potential use-cases of the primitive, and slows down protocols depending on the number of round trips that need to happen between the prover and the verifier. Fortunately, some ZKPs can be constructed without interaction with a verifier. In other words, a prover can simply create a proof, and that proof can be verified by anyone at any point in time later without further help from the prover. When ZKPs are made non-interactive, we simply call them non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs or <strong>NIZKs</strong>. I talk more about <a href="https://www.cryptologie.net/article/193/schnorrs-signature-and-non-interactive-protocols/">the link between signatures and zero-knowledge proofs here</a>.<br>
ZKPs and NIZKs can also be constructed on much more general statements like “I know an input to some function such that the execution gives some output”, or more specifically “I know $a$ in $f(a, b) = c$”. If this still doesn’t make sense think about the usual example given to illustrate general-purpose ZKPs: “I know the solution of the sudoku”. <br>
We’re almost there: <strong>ZK-SNARKs</strong> are general-purpose non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and more! They are also <strong>succinct</strong>, meaning that the proofs they produce are small in size and are fast to verify, which makes them so special they deserve to be called ZK-SNARKs. Not every modern proof systems deserve that special classification, for example STARKs don’t :(</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>zero-knowledge proof: a cryptographic proof that you know something, without revealing the something</li>
<li>non interactive: a proof that was constructed without the help of a verifier</li>
<li>general purpose: a proof of a more general statement, like the knowledge of secret inputs or outputs of a program</li>
<li>succinct: a small proof that is fast to verify</li>
</ul>
<p>But not only did you ask, what are ZK-SNARKs, but you also asked about how they work.</p>
<h2>The actual stuff</h2>
<p>And oh boy, this is a complex subject to answer. First and foremost, there are many many schemes, too many of them, and so I’m not sure exactly how to answer that question. But I have some idea of how some of them work, and so I imagine that most of them follow that pattern, or improve on it, so let me explain…</p>
<p>There’s two parts to your typical ZK-SNARK: </p>
<ol>
<li>The proving system, which I'll explain in this post.</li>
<li>The translation or compilation of a program to something the proving system can prove, which I'll explain in part 2 of this post.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first part is not too hard to understand, while the second sort of requires a graduate course into the subject…</p>
<h3>Proving your knowledge of a constrained polynomial</h3>
<p>Here it is, remember that one: ZK-SNARKs are all about proving that you know some polynomial $f(x)$ that has some roots.
By roots I mean that the verifier has some values in mind (e.g. $1$ and $2$) and the prover must prove that the secret polynomial they have in mind evaluates to $0$ for this values (e.g. $f(1) = f(2) = 0$).
By the way, a polynomial that has 1 and 2 as roots (in our example) can be written as $f(x)=(x-1)(x-2)h(x)$ for some polynomial $h(x)$. (If you’re not convinced try to evaluate that at $x=1$ and $x=2$.)
So we say that the prover must prove that they know an $f(x)$ and $h(x)$ such that $f(x) = t(x)h(x)$ for some target polynomial $t(x) = (x-1)(x-2)$ (in the example that $1$ and $2$ are the roots that the verifier wants to check).</p>
<p>But that’s it, that’s what ZK-SNARKs proving systems usually provide: something to prove that you know some polynomial. I’m repeating this because the first time I learned about that it made no sense to me: how can you prove that you know some secret input to a program, if all you can prove is that you know a polynomial. Well, that’s why part 2 of this explanation is so difficult: it’s about translating a program into a polynomial. But more on that later.</p>
<p>Back to our proving system, how does one prove that they know such a function $f(x)$? Well they just have to prove that they know an $h(x)$ such that you can write $f(x)$ as $f(x) = t(x)h(x)$. Ugh… Not so fast here. We’re talking about <strong>zero-knowledge</strong> proofs right? How can we prove this without giving out $f(x)$? Well, by using three tricks!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>homomorphic commitments</strong></li>
<li><strong>bilinear pairings</strong></li>
<li><strong>different polynomials evaluate to different values most of the time</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>So let's go through each of them shall we?</p>
<h3>Homomorphic commitments</h3>
<p>The first trick is to use <strong>commitments</strong> to hide the values that we’re sending to the prover. But not only do we hide them, we also want to allow the <strong>verifier</strong> to perform some operations on them so that they can verify the proof. Specifically verify that if the prover commits on their polynomial $f(x)$ as well as $h(x)$, then we have
$$
com(f(x)) = com(t(x)) com(h(x)) = com(t(x)h(x))
$$ </p>
<p>where $com(t(x))$ is computed by the verifier as these are the known constraints on the polynomial.
These operations are called <strong>homomorphic operations</strong> and we can’t perform them if we use hash functions as commitment mechanisms. Instead, we can simply “hide the values in the exponent” (e.g. for a value $v$ then send the commitment $g^v \mod{p}$) as these are commitments that allow for these homomorphic operations. (To convince yourself, observe that if $a = bc$ then $g^a = g^b g^c = g^{b+c}$. </p>
<p>Wait, this is not what we wanted… we wanted $g^a = g^{bc}$.</p>
<h3>Bilinear pairings</h3>
<p>$g^a = (g^b)^c = g^{bc}$ gets us there, but only if $c$ is a known value and not a commitment (e.g. $g^c$). Unfortunately this is a limitation for our proving protocol, as there will be multiplication operations between commitments. This is where <strong>bilinear pairings</strong> can be used to unblock us, and this is the <em>sole reason</em> why we use bilinear pairings in a ZK-SNARK (really just to be able to multiply the values inside the commitments).
I don’t want to go too deep into what bilinear pairings are, but just know that it is just another tool in our toolkit that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes two values of our group (the values generates by $g$ raised to different powers modulo $p$) and place them in another group.</li>
<li>By moving stuff from one group to the other, <strong>we can multiply things that couldn't be multiplied previously</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So using $e$ as the typical way of writing a bilinear pairing, we have $e(g_1, g_2) = h_3$ and we can use it to perform multiplications hidden in the exponent via this one equation:</p>
<p>$$
e(g^b, g^c) = e(g)^{bc}
$$</p>
<p>But no more about bilinear pairings! Again that’s the only reason why we use these in ZK-SNARKs. It’s just a trick to make our homomorphic commitments more homomorphic, to allow us to do:</p>
<p>$$
com(f(x)) = com(t(x)) com(h(x)) = com(t(x)h(x))
$$</p>
<h3>Where does the succinctness comes from?</h3>
<p>Finally, the <strong>succinctness</strong> of ZK-SNARKs come from the fact that two functions that differ will evaluate to different points most of the time.
What this means for us is that if my $f(x)$ is not really equal to $t(x)h(x)$, meaning that I don’t have a polynomial $f(x)$ that really has the roots we’ve chosen with the verifier, then evaluating $f(x)$ and $t(x)h(x)$ at a random point $r$ will not give out the same result (most of the time). In other words for almost all $r$, $f(r) \neq t(r)h(r)$.</p>
<p>This is known as the <strong>Schwartz-Zippel lemma</strong>, which I pictured in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img alt="schwartz zippel lemma" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2020-11-01_at_11.48_.47_AM_.png"></p>
<p>Knowing this, it is enough to prove that $com(f(r)) = com(t(r)h(r))$ for some random point $r$. This is why ZK-SNARKs are so small; by comparing points in a group you end up comparing entire polynomials!</p>
<p>But this is also why there is a “trusted setup” needed before most ZK-SNARKs can work. If a prover learns the random point $r$, then they can forge bad polynomials that will verify. So a trusted setup is about:</p>
<ol>
<li>creating a random value $r$</li>
<li>committing different exponentiation of it $g^r, g^{r^2}, g^{r^3}, \ldots$ so that they can be used by the prover to compute their polynomial without knowing the point $r$</li>
<li>destroying the value $r$</li>
</ol>
<p>Does the second point makes sense? If my polynomial as the prover is $f(x) = x^2 + x$ then all I have to do is compute $g^{r^2} g^r$ to obtain a commitment of my polynomial evaluated at that random point $r$.</p>
<p>Next, I'll write the second part of this blogpost and you'll have to wait until I'm done.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, you’re greeted with clear questions, descriptions, and illustrations. One of the mistakes a lot of people make when choosing/making illustrations is the lack of relevance. The illustration may look pretty, but it can do more harm than good if it’s irrelevant to your main headline.</p>
<p>They tell you explicitly at the top of the page that each choice comes with a personalized onboarding experience.</p>
<p><code>We’ll streamline your setup experience accordingly.</code></p>
<p>It makes sense. People using Notion for their own personal use will have their own way of using Notion, while teams will more likely require more collaboration.</p>
<p>Let’s choose For <em>myself</em>.</p>

<p>Once you click ‘Take me to Notion’, you aren’t just kept waiting. They provide you with feedback. ‘Getting ready’. This is a concept called Idleness Aversion and it’s present in hundreds of apps. Uber being one of the famous examples all around the internet.</p>
<p>When you call in an Uber, you’re provided with real-time graphics of where the driver currently is. This is much better practice than just showing a static image of a car. This simply removes the anxiety of not knowing where the driver is and whether you’re going to be late or not.</p>
<p>This applies to any loading message you receive, it gives you feedback so you don’t have to wait around not knowing what’s going on.</p>

<p>If you could stop a genocide-would you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In western China, right now, more than a million men, women, and children sit in reeducation camps. Mothers separated from children, forced marriages, forced sterilizations-Margaret Atwood’s fiction made a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s to be done? Have we learned nothing? From Rwanda, from the Holocaust, from the Holomodor? The cat’s out of the bag, and the End of history is over. Finally, we can acknowledge that the future is not just greyed out liberal democracy, 2% a year GDP growth, easing ourselves into decadence. In reality, our dark 20th century never really left us after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernity and the belief in bad people are incompatible.&nbsp; The enlightenment has swept conflict under the rug and right out the Overton window. Hobbes, banished from the lexicon. To even conceive a world with people who are themselves, <i>bad,</i> is a heretical assumption. To understand the aspects of human nature that are deeply problematic is to understand the true nature of reality. American culture lulled to sleep by narcotics and video games, our senses dulled by ultra-palatable foods and 2-hour delivery. In some sense, things are better than they ever have been before; in another sense, they’re much worse. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Americans are depressed, fat, and lead lives bereft of meaning. We are reduced to larping real revolutionary change on the streets, with bats, shields, and batons. A simulacra of revolution, a cry for meaning in a world gone mad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall a cool October night in 2018. Joe Biden spoke softly to a crowd I was a part of. Bathed in dim light, he rambled. He wove soft, slow, soliloquies on American Greatness. He remarked on the magnificence of our landmass. That we are surrounded by vast oceans, blessed by great mineral reserves, possessing unrivalled food production capability, the mightiest navy the world has ever seen. The Zeihan-Esque supposition? Geography is destiny. Our geopolitical rivals? Nothing to worry about. China-why worry about China…&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “c’mon man.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This theory is seductive because it is easy. It’s a denial of agency-the idea that nothing can be done to challenge us. This makes our position precarious. You can’t fix problems you can’t see. If, like Biden says-we’re the greatest country in the world, why can’t we stop Uighur persecution in Xinjiang? The reason, I posit here, is that for all our technical capability, we lack the will and imagination to see it through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the farthest reaches of eastern North Carolina sits a massive dune of sand. Jockey’s Ridge rises out of the warm waters of the Pamlico Sound. Here, a century ago, two men from Ohio made history with the first powered flight.&nbsp; Wilbur and Orville Wright were bicycle mechanics-yet they were the first to fly. Imagine the expectations for a bicycle mechanic today. Produce a plane-are you kidding me? <i>That’s for the experts, the technocrats.</i> The institutionalization of science, of technology, of politics, has eroded our capability to achieve the American greatness we, as a people, are destined for. Science, once&nbsp; a process of obtaining truth-has become a bloated bureaucratic institution, a tool for politicians. . When our ruling class says “trust science” they don’t mean “trust the process of inquiry”, they mean “trust our experts.” Somehow, we have gone from a culture that encourages bicycle mechanics to invent an airplane to American institutions that can no longer prevent planes many times more advanced from diving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX"><u>straight into the ground</u></a>. (Really like this bit.)</p>
<p>The belief, the conceit, is that only experts can manipulate reality. But while experts have gotten us into this mess, they won’t get us out. This is not to denigrate experts, but the bureaucracies in which they work have become sick-sick enough that our planes fall out of the sky, and our factories that produce life-saving PPE have been shipped off our continent long ago. Their bureaucracies and their selection mechanisms have become corrupt, and sclerotic. What is to be done?</p>
<h3>Stopping a genocide.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>American military might is now too far behind to stop the genocide. Our carriers can be shot out of the water, with advanced surface to surface Chinese missiles. Tariffs won’t work either-just look at North Korea. but with a little imagination-a plan from me, a 26-year-old technologist emerges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we need to visualize the problem as a chessboard. Each player has strategic pieces-some are stronger than others. Here, we want to understand how to incentivize the PRC to close the camps and allow Xinjiang a level of autonomy it rightly deserves. Bludgeoning them into submission won’t work. Attacking the PRC, whether rhetorically or physically will get us nowhere. The only way for us to avert a genocide is to alter the incentive structure, in such a way that it is easy and graceful for the PRC to change course. Attacking will just lead to path dependence for the CCP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, our strengths. Currently, America’s most powerful institutions are our worldwide entertainment and corporations. Hollywood, the NBA, Disney. These institutions have soft power that matters to a lot of people overseas. When I worked in China, I was always amazed at how popular the NBA was. The finals played on almost every TV and billboard I saw. With over 600 million viewers in China, the NBA is a cultural behemoth. It is important to note that China is a rising power, with a burgeoning middle class. This middle class finally has time to consume entertainment-and what a luxury it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>America has a monopoly on the best basketball played anywhere. It’s quality is unsurpassed. Paragraph 1.1 of the Wikipedia page on Olympic basketball is aptly entitled “American Dominance.” A monopoly gives you market power. You can squash competitors, and you can force people to obey your will. In this way, the NBA has power, and I propose that it use it to solve a genocide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is quite simple. Adam Silver contacts the CCP, and requests that they start treating Uighurs decently, with a list of specific demands- let everyone go, and start over as if nothing ever happened. There is no need for this to be violent: everyone who was involved (police officers, bureaucrats, administrators) will be given new positions elsewhere and taken care of appropriately. The camps will be demolished, and each individual sent home. Mr Silver will do this respectfully, there is no need to be ugly, and without disrespect to the CCP’s power in mainland China.</p>
<p>If they refuse, the commissioner’s next move will be to offer alternatives.<i> A full-scale PR nightmare. We will publicly embrace the CCP, and Chinese people. No hate for either (or Xi himself), but we will pack our stands with Uighur refugees, and activists. We will put #freeuighurs on the court at every game, and we will continue to do this until the situation resolves to our liking.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCP can try to ban the NBA, but it will face serious backlash. The party has experienced this before. When things are very unpopular, they try to fix them. 600 million fans of the NBA <i>want </i>to watch basketball, and even only a minority are diehard fans, those diehard fans will make their displeasure known, and it would hardly prove expedient to throw half the country into camps if they disagree with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I like to say, “hell hath no fury like a consumer scorned.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario here is that China really does successfully ban the league. I find this eventuality unlikely, but this is where the State Department enters. We can organize a group that writes an insurance policy for the NBA-you lose revenue, we’ll cover your costs. Putting this together, we could make it a no-lose situation for the NBA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy, if implemented, has a high chance of success- in fact, it may have the highest chance of success that currently exists in the problem space. Tariffs don’t work, sanctions don’t work, military force won’t work, but maybe, just maybe, asking nicely, while carrying cultural clout of American basketball might.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>A demo with a client this week got me thinking again about happiness. More Specifically, developer happiness and the story of Swimm. When we founded  <a href="https://swimm.io/">Swimm</a>  it was clear we came to solve a pain that any developer or engineering manager was more than happy to confirm: It’s a hard and long process to onboard a new dev team, and a new codebase. It takes time, a long time (we’ve heard from managers that in some cases it takes up to a year!), and it is…well, painful.</p>
<p>We surveyed engineers in over 80 companies and quickly did the math*:* if you are an organization that onboards 100 developers a year and it takes an average of 4 months to onboard them, then as the engineering manager in charge of those developers, you’ll lose approximately 30 years of contribution, which sounds astronomic by all measures.</p>
<p>Armed with this simple but efficient formula we started working on the concept of Swimm, we raised initial funding and built our MVP. Once we started being in touch with CTOs and engineering managers, we pitched our magic formula and started to test Swimm with design partners.</p>
<p>A CTO of one of these partnering companies said something that made us, the founders, move uncomfortably in our chairs. When it was time to set up the KPIs for this pilot, we were (as well trained entrepreneurs seldom are) ready for the classic sales formula… but then he threw this curve ball: ‘Developer Happiness’.</p>
<p>Of course it was important for him to reduce the ramp-up time for his new hires, of course it made sense for him to find a better solution than the classic code documentation that becomes so quickly obsolete, and of course he wanted to find a solution to streamline their remote onboarding process. But these were not his main concerns. First on his list, was actually the very reason why we envisioned Swimm: Developer Happiness.</p>
<p>Simply put, we almost missed calling it by its name. Yes, of course it was part of our ‘<em>why’</em> when we began this journey, but without noticing we almost morphed this ‘why’ into a math formula. Because developer happiness is hard to quantify and pin down, it’s easily overlooked and forgotten. But it is directly linked  <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/20/developer-happiness-right-tools-job/">to the tools that ease your everyday work</a> .</p>
<p>To this CTO though, it was clearly at highest priority. His cyber-security start-up had recently hired a few developers and for some of them, the process had been far from ‘happy’. Being onboarded onto a new codebase, on a new team is a tough human journey. How difficult can it be? Don’t just take our word for it, ask your developers.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow is my first day on the job.</p><p>Excited to meet the codebase and feel totally overwhelmed and incompetent.</p><p>Such is the life of a developer. 😎</p></div>— Martha Sharpe (@SharpeMartha) <a href="https://twitter.com/SharpeMartha/status/1277432600966180864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ME: learning takes time and it's important to be kind to yourself<br>ALSO ME: wow it's been 2 weeks and I can't recite every moving part of this sprawling legacy codebase, throw me into the trash</p>— bletchley punk is a fullmetal engineer (@alicegoldfuss) <a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1278074600618778624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>But we entrepreneurs and managers invest so much time and money to source and hire the very best developers. We pay them the highest salaries, invest in their personal growth, present the swaggiest swag, the most photogenic happy hours and really the best food. And there is a reason for that: they are the magic-makers, the builders, the ones who execute our vision.</p>
<p>As in any relationship, true happiness is achieved through real, deep, meaningful investment. While it’s true that bringing your spouse flowers will get you a nice evening (though not guaranteed), or a fun vacation will create nice memories, it’s only through day-to-day dedication, deep investment in another person’s well being, and personal development, that they will flourish in a long-term relationship. The same goes for your developers, you can’t expect them to be on the front of your company, to fight your most important battles and not to truly and meaningfully invest in them.</p>
<p>Building the right training for your new hires is truthfully no fun at all, (the swag is an upside, I’ll admit), but building tutorials on your codebase for example is a hassle. However, throwing them in at the deep-end and asking them to swim without the right tools for success is another way of saying: “we want you to do your very best while we do what’s easy for us — paying you and hoping for the best”.</p>
<p>If you do invest in the happiness of your developers, they will pay it forward. Not only by being efficient and by contributing better code, but by becoming truly devoted to the company and its goals, because in a true long-term and happy relationship, you are ready to fight to make it work and <em>when it gets hard, you don’t break.</em></p>

<p>What is the correct way to model one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many? Where do foreign keys go? What criteria to use? How to decide? I see these questions repeated on StackOverflow time and again.</p>

Last August, it came out that a whistleblower accused the Danish military and signals intelligence service (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Defence_Intelligence_Service" target="_blank"><i>Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste</i></a> or FE) of unlawful activities and deliberately misleading the intelligence oversight board. </p><p>

Meanwhile, the Danish press was able to paint a surprisingly comprehensive and detailed picture of how the FE cooperated with the NSA in <a href="#cabletapping"><b>cable tapping</b></a> on Danish soil.</p><p>

It was further revealed that the Americans provided Denmark with a sophisticated <a href="#spysystem"><b>new spy system</b></a> which includes the NSA's data processing system <a href="#xkeyscore"><b>XKEYSCORE</b></a>.</p><p>

A Danish paper also disclosed that the accusation of <a href="#unlawful"><b>unlawful collection</b></a> came from a young FE employee who reminds of Edward Snowden. A newly established investigation commission now has to clarify whether he was driven by fears or by facts.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FEhoYi_a0EI/X3lHJbfeSlI/AAAAAAAAEyk/urOidzARWswgJstbeNFiU8CRo38JQMufACPcBGAYYCw/s800/fe-xks-header.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="420" data-original-width="800" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FEhoYi_a0EI/X3lHJbfeSlI/AAAAAAAAEyk/urOidzARWswgJstbeNFiU8CRo38JQMufACPcBGAYYCw/s800/fe-xks-header.jpg" width="600"></a></p>

<p><span size="+2">Cable tapping</span></p><p>

In an extensive piece from September 13, the renowned Danish newspaper <a href="https://www.berlingske.dk/samfund/et-pengeskab-paa-kastellet-har-i-aartier-gemt-paa-et-dybt-fortroligt" target="_blank"><i>Berlingske</i></a> (founded in 1749) describes how the FE, in cooperation with the NSA, started to tap an international telecommunications cable in order to gather foreign intelligence.</p><p>
  
  In the mid-1990s, the NSA had found out that somewhere under Copenhagen there was a backbone cable containing phone calls, e-mails and text messages from and to countries like China and Russia, which was of great interest for the Americans.</p><p>
  
Tapping that cable, however, was almost impossible without the help of the Danes, so the NSA asked the FE for access to the cable, but this request was denied, according to Berlingske.</p><p>
  
  
  <b>Agreement with the United States</b></p><p>
  
  The US government did not give up, and in a letter sent directly to the Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, US president Clinton asked his Danish colleague to reconsider the decision. And Nyrup, who was a sworn supporter of a close relationship with the US, said yes. </p><p>
  
  The cooperation was laid down in a document, which, according to Berlingske, all Danish defense ministers had to sign "so that any new minister could see that his predecessor - and his predecessors before his predecessors - with their signatures had been part of this small, exclusive circle of people who knew one of the kingdom's biggest secrets."</p><p> 
    
  The code name for this cooperation is not known, but it's most likely part of the NSA's umbrella program <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/10/the-german-operation-eikonal-as-part-of.html#rampart-a">RAMPART-A</a>. Under this program, which started in 1992, foreign partners <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1200864/tssinframpartaoverview-v1-0-redacted-information.pdf" target="_blank">provide</a> access to high-capacity international fiber-optic cables, while the US provides the equipment for transport, processing and analysis:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VQv_x5OW4VM/VD2MIOzUWkI/AAAAAAAAB8o/rxZgVvQ4hmI/s1600/rampart-a-2010-diagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VQv_x5OW4VM/VD2MIOzUWkI/AAAAAAAAB8o/rxZgVvQ4hmI/s1600/rampart-a-2010-diagram.jpg" title="Slide from an NSA presentation about the RAMPART-A program" width="450"></a></p>
   
  <p>

  <b>Agreement with a cable operator</b></p><p>
  
To make sure that tapping the cable was as legal as possible, the government asked approval of the private Danish company that operated the cable. The company agreed, but only when it was approved at the highest level, and so the agreement was signed by prime minister Rasmussen, minister of defense Hækkerup and head of department Troldborg. </p><p>
  
  Because the cable contained international telecommunications it was considered to fall within the FE's foreign intelligence mandate. The agreement was prepared in only one copy, which was shown to the company and then locked in a safe at the FE's headquarters at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811152740/https://fe-ddis.dk/om-os/Organisation/lokaliteter-i-dk/Pages/Kastellet.aspx" target="_blank">Kastellet</a> fortress in Copenhagen, according to Berlingske.</p><p>

 This Danish agreement is very similar to the <a href="http://download.krone.at/pdf/VertragWZschwarz.pdf" target="_blank">Transit Agreement</a> between the German foreign intelligence service BND and Deutsche Telekom, in which the latter agreed to provide access to international transit cables at its switching center in Frankfurt am Main. The BND then tapped these cables with help from the NSA under <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/05/new-details-about-joint-nsa-bnd.html">operation Eikonal</a> (2004-2008).</p><p>
  
  
    <b>Processing at Sandagergård</b></p><p>
  
  Berlingske reported that the communications data that were extracted from the backbone cable in Copenhagen were sent from the Danish company's technical hub to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811153920/https://fe-ddis.dk/om-os/Organisation/lokaliteter-i-dk/Pages/Sandagergaard.aspx" target="_blank">Sandagergård complex</a> of the FE on the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amager" target="_blank">Amager</a>. The US had paid for a cable between the two locations.</p><p>
  
  At Sandagergård, the "NSA made sure to install the technology that made it possible to enter keywords and translate the huge amount of information, so-called raw data from the cable tapping, into "readable" information."</p><p>
  
The filter system was not only fed by keywords from the FE, but the NSA also provided "the FE with a series of keywords that are relevant to the United States. The FE then reviews them - and checks that there are basically no Danes among them - and then enters the keywords" according to sources cited by Berlingske.</p><p>
  
  Besides this filtering with keywords and selectors, the FE and the NSA will also have used the metadata for <a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/docs/doc/B17-TDB-Knowledge-Sharing.pdf" target="_blank">contact-chaining</a>, which means reconstructing which phone numbers and e-mail addresses had been in contact with each other, in order to create social network graphs - something the sources apparently didn't want to disclose to Berlingske.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zFJ49f56CXY/X5PXqIaouqI/AAAAAAAAEzY/TJwURx3Jn6oCxN9s4I3LqKKu1EhtLPEAACPcBGAYYCw/s1351/dk-cables.JPG"><img alt="" data-original-height="830" data-original-width="1351" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zFJ49f56CXY/X5PXqIaouqI/AAAAAAAAEzY/TJwURx3Jn6oCxN9s4I3LqKKu1EhtLPEAACPcBGAYYCw/s1351/dk-cables.JPG" width="550"></a></p>

      <b>Trusted partners</b></p><p>
  
  Part of the agreement between the US and Denmark was that "the USA does not use the system against Danish citizens and companies. And the other way around". Similar words can be found in an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1200860-odd-s3-overviewnov2011-v1-0-redacted-information.html" target="_blank">NSA presentation</a> from 2011: "No US collection by Partner and No Host Country collection by US" - although this is followed by "there ARE exceptions!"</p><p>
  
  The latter remark may have inspired Edward Snowden to accuse the NSA of abusing these cooperations with foreign partner agencies to spy on European citizens, but as a source told Berlingske: </p><p>
  
  "I can not at all imagine in my imagination that the NSA would betray that trust. I consider it completely and utterly unlikely. If the NSA had a desire to obtain information about Danish citizens or companies, the United States would simply turn to [the domestic security service] PET, which would then provide the necessary legal basis."</p><p>
  
The source also said that "the NSA wanted to jump and run for Denmark. The agency did everything Denmark asked for, without discussion. The NSA continuously helped Denmark - because of this cable access. [...] Denmark was a very, very close and valued partner."</p><p>
    
This close and successful cooperation was apparently one of the reasons for the visit of president Bill Clinton to Denmark in July 1997, according to Berlingske.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1-v3T8EQqk0/X3gIQLWgChI/AAAAAAAAEyE/j-yGk3qiStcS3Y692bc25UT6WG1_B_2BACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/clinton-rasmussen.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1-v3T8EQqk0/X3gIQLWgChI/AAAAAAAAEyE/j-yGk3qiStcS3Y692bc25UT6WG1_B_2BACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/clinton-rasmussen.jpg" width="550"></a></p>

<p><span size="+2">A new spy system</span></p><p>
  
  In the wake of the FE scandal even more recent developments have been revealed: a <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/ny-afsloering-fe-masseindsamler-oplysninger-om-danskere-gennem-avanceret-spionsystem" target="_blank">report</a> by the Danish broadcaster DR from September 24, 2020 provides interesting details about how the Americans provided Denmark with a sophisticated new "spy system".</p><p>
  
After the FE got a new head of procurement in 2008, NSA employees frequently traveled to Denmark for quite some time to build the necessary hardware and install the required software for the new system, which DR News describes as extremely advanced. It also has a special internal code name, which the broadcaster decided not to publish. It's also this new system through which the alleged illegal collection of Danish data took place.</p><p>
  
  According to DR News, the NSA technicians were also involved in the construction of a new data center at the FE's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811153920/https://fe-ddis.dk/om-os/Organisation/lokaliteter-i-dk/Pages/Sandagergaard.aspx" target="_blank">Sandagergård complex</a> on Amager that was specifically built to house the new spy system, which was taken into use somewhere between 2012 and 2014. The cooperation between the FE and the NSA on this specific system was based upon a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by then FE chief <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ahrenkiel" target="_blank">Thomas Ahrenkiel</a>.</p><p>

  
  
  <b>Filter systems</b></p><p>
  
The DR News <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/ny-afsloering-fe-masseindsamler-oplysninger-om-danskere-gennem-avanceret-spionsystem" target="_blank">report</a> also goes into more detail about the interception process. It says that first, the intelligence service identifies a data stream that may be interesting, after which they "mirror" the light that passes through the particular fiber-optic cables. In this way, they copy both metadata and content, like text messages, chat conversations, phone calls and e-mails, and send them to the FE's data center at Sandagergård.</p><p>

  
According to DR News, the FE tried to develop a number of filters to ensure that data from Danish citizens and companies is sorted out and not made searchable by the new spy system. The former Danish minister of defense Claus Hjort Frederiksen recently <a href="http://www.weekendavisen.dk/2020-37/samfund/landsskadeligt" target="_blank">said</a> that there was indeed an attempt to develop such filters, but at the same time he admitted that there can be no guarantee that no Danish information will pass through.</p><p><span size="+2">XKEYSCORE</span></p><p>

  DR News also reported that the heart of the new spy system is formed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKEYSCORE</a>, which was developed by the NSA and the existence of which was first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data" target="_blank">revealed</a> by The Guardian in June 2013.</p><p> 
  
  The NSA's British counterpart GCHQ incorporated XKEYSCORE in its own system for processing bulk internet data codenamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora" target="_blank">TEMPORA</a> and it can be assumed that the other <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-foreign-partnerships.html#2ndparty">Second Party</a> partners (also known as the Five Eyes) also use this system, whether or not under a different codename.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t6LWjnPz3Wo/X3LLi61rZzI/AAAAAAAAExc/-F5vREaIi4oBCAZ_LNhvOOJFVnHnLlFbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/xks%2Bintro.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t6LWjnPz3Wo/X3LLi61rZzI/AAAAAAAAExc/-F5vREaIi4oBCAZ_LNhvOOJFVnHnLlFbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/xks%2Bintro.JPG" width="500"></a></p>
  <p>
  
From the Snowden documents we know that the NSA also provided XKEYSCORE to some of its <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-foreign-partnerships.html#3rdparty">Third Party</a> partners: the German <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2016/09/secret-report-reveals-german-bnd-also.html">foreign intelligence service BND</a> and domestic security service BfV, the Swedish signals intelligence service FRA and the Japanese Directorate for SIGINT. It is new though that the Danish military intelligence service FE uses the system too.</p><p>

  
Some press reports seem to suggest that these partner agencies "gain access to XKEYSCORE" as if it would allow them to connect to a huge global mass surveillance system. The latter may be the case for the NSA's Second Party partners, but the Third Party partners are using XKEYSCORE only to process and analyze data from their own tapping points and are not able to access data from Five Eyes collection platforms.</p><p>
  
  Likewise, NSA analysts using XKEYSCORE don't have direct …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p><i>Posted on October 28, 2020</i></p><p>This article isn't about which programming language is better, instead it discusses the most powerful tool set for development of the fastest server-side system software, such as database engines and HTTPS servers. There are several specific properties of this type of software: </p><ul><li>Relatively large code base, 100,000 lines of C or C++ code and more. While it's possible to write particular, the most 'hot' functions, in Assembly language, it's impractical to write the whole program in Assembly. </li><li>Databases and web servers are mission-critical software - we all got used that our Linux systems with MySQL and Nginx processes work for months and years. There are <a href="https://github.com/tempesta-tech/tempesta/wiki/High-availability">simple high availability</a> best practices mitigating the downtime due to possible crashes, but they're the subject for another article. Meantime, it's worth mentioning that if you really-really care about high availability, then you should build you infrastructure with an assumption that any component of your system may crash at any time, just like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/801871/">Facebook does this</a> -the company deploys the recent versions of the Linux kernel as soon as they're available. </li></ul><p>We've been developing the <a href="http://tempesta-tech.com/c++-services">fastest software in C, C++, and Assembly</a> for ages. It's not a surprise that since Rust is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">"focused on performance"</a> we're very interested in it. With a bit of skepticism though. Just remember the rise of Java programming language: there were a lot of reports that the JIT compilation produced code faster than C++. Now it's hard to find a case, when C++ is slower than Java, see for example the <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/java.html">benchmark game</a>. It's also worth mentioning that the memory garbage collection (GC) in Java leads to high tail latencies and it's hard or even impossible to do anything with the problem. Golang can not be considered for high performance programming also due to the GC. </p><h2>C or C++? Or both of them?</h2><p> The C programming language dominates in the system programming. An operating system kernel is an example of one of the most sophisticated system software, not only because it deals with hardware directly, but also due to strict performance requirements. The Linux and FreeBSD kernels are written in C, as well as the other UNIX'es and Windows kernels. Let's start the discussion from this bright example of high-performance system software. </p><h3>C++ for operating systems kernel development</h3><p> FreeBSD <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/driver-building-in-c.35701/">has been supporting C++ modules</a> for a while. While the Linux kernel never supported C++, there was <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/click:tocs00/paper.pdf">the Click modular router</a> written in C++ and working as a Linux kernel module. If you're interested in C++ applicability for the operating systems kernel development, then you can find quite good discussions in the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/C++">C++</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/C++_Bare_Bones">Bare bones</a> articles. However, there are fundamental reasons against using C++ for operating system kernel development: </p><ul><li>You do not have <code>libstdc++</code> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information">RTTI</a> and exceptions in the kernel space. Actually, <code>dynamic_cast</code> isn't so frequently used and there are a lot of C++ projects compiled without RTTI. If you need exceptions, then you have to port them into the kernel. <code>libstdc++</code> uses basic C allocations, so it must be significantly reworked for the kernel. </li><li>You can't use the STL and Boost libraries and, in fact, all kernels already have their own libraries. C++ introduces filesystem, threading and networking libraries, which are senseless in an OS kernel. From the other hand, the modern OSes provide advanced synchronization primitives, which are still not available in standard C++ (e.g. there is still no read-write spinlocks in C++). </li><li>The Linux kernel provides number of memory allocators (SLAB, page, <code>vmalloc()</code>, <code>kmalloc()</code>, and so on), thus you have to use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new"><code>placement new</code></a> and/or just use the C functions for memory allocation and freeing. Aligned memory is crucial for the performance, but you need to write special wrappers to get aligned memory with <code>new</code>. </li><li>Strong type safety isn't so comfortable for system programming when raw memory pointers are frequently casted to some data structures. This is debatable though: while some people are uncomfortable with frequent <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;Foo *&gt;(ptr)</code> instead of short <code>(Foo *)ptr</code>, the others are good with more typing and more type safety. </li><li>C++ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">name mangling</a>, required for namespaces and function overloading, makes function hard to call from Assembly, so you need to use <code>extern "C"</code>. </li><li>You have to make special code sections for static objects constructors and destructors, <code>.ctor</code> and <code>.dtor</code> correspondingly. </li><li>C++ exceptions can not cross <i>context</i> boundaries, i.e. you can not throw an exception in one thread and catch it in another. The operating system kernel deals with much more complex context model: there are kernel threads, user space processes entering into the kernel, deferred and hardware interruptions. The contexts can preempt each other in voluntarily or cooperative manner, so exception handling of current context could be preempted by another context. There are also memory management and contexts switching code which could conflict with exception handling code. Just like for RTTI, it's possible to implement the mechanism in kernel, but the current standard library can not be used. </li><li>While Clang and G++ support <code>__restrict__</code> extension, the official C++ standard <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-C++-have-an-equivalent-of-Cs-restrict-specifier">does not support</a> it. </li><li>Variable length arrays (VLA) are <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749064/">discouraged</a> in the Linux kernel, they are still handy in some scenarios, but are <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.std.c++/c/K_4lgA1JYeg?pli=1">completely unavailable in C++</a>. </li></ul><p> Thus, with C++ in the kernel space you basically have only templates, classes inheritance and some syntax sugar like lambda functions. Since system code is quite rarely requires complicated abstractions and inheritances, then does it still have sense to make effort to use C++ in the kernel space? </p><h3>C++ exceptions</h3><p> This is one of the most <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/03/13/trip-report-march-2010-iso-c-standards-meeting/">debatable</a> C++ feature and it deserves a separate chapter. For example, the MySQL project, following to the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Exceptions">Google coding style</a>, <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_CODING_GUIDELINES.html">doesn't use exceptions</a>. The Google coding style provides the good lists of pros and cons of using exceptions. Here we focus on performance aspects only. </p><p>Exceptions can improve performance when we have to handle error codes in too may places, e.g. (let the functions be inlined and very small) </p><pre><code>
        if (func_1())
            return -EINVAL;
        if (func_2())
            return -EINVAL;
        ....
        if (func_100())
            return -EINVAL;
    </code></pre><p> The problem with the code is that there are extra conditional jumps. Modern CPU are pretty good with branch prediction, but it still hurts performance. In C++ we can just write </p><pre><code>
        try {
            func_1();
            func_2();
            ...
            func_100();
        } catch (...) {
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    </code></pre><p> , so there are no extra conditions in the <i>hot</i> path. However, this isn't for free: most of the functions in your C++ code have to have extra epilogues with a table of exceptions, which these functions can catch, and an appropriate cleanup table. The function epilogues aren't executed in normal workflow, but they increase the size of code causing extra pollution in the CPU instruction cache. You can find great details about C++ exception handling internals in the <a href="https://monoinfinito.wordpress.com/series/exception-handling-in-c/">Nico Brailovsky's blog</a>. </p><h3>Is C++ still good?</h3><p> Yes, it is. Firstly, not the whole code actually must be as fast as possible and in most of the places we don't need custom memory allocation and don't care about exceptions overhead. The most of the projects are developed in the user space and benefit, especially the new ones, from relatively rich C++ standard and Boost libraries (not so rich as Java's though). </p><p>Secondly, the killing feature of C++ is that <b>it is C</b>. If you don't want to use exceptions or RTTI, then you can just switch the features off. Most of C programs can be just compiled with a C++ compiler with very small changes or without any changes at all. As an example, we need only this trivial change </p><pre><code>

The modern C++ compilers provide C compatibility extensions like the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword. You always can write the most performance critical code of a C++ program in C style. If you don't like the <a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:8/">STL containers with an overhead</a>, then you can use <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/intrusive.html">Boost.intrusive</a> or even port a similar container from the Linux kernel or other fast C project -in most of the cases this won't be painful.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tasks were selected by the following criteria. The task set should be as small as possible yet reflect as many typical (or fundamental or representative) challenges in GUI programming as possible. Each task should be as simple and self-contained as possible yet not too artificial. Preferably, a task should be based on existing examples as that gives the task more justification to be useful and there already will be at least one reference implementation.</p><p>Below, a description of each task highlighted with the challenges it reflects and a screenshot of the resulting GUI application in Java/Swing is given.</p><p>For a live version of the tasks see my<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis-React-TypeScript-MobX/">React/MobX</a> <!-- -->implementation.</p><h2>Counter</h2><p><em>Challenge:</em> Understanding the basic ideas of a language/toolkit.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/counter.9cd92091.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing a label or read-only textfield<!-- --> <em>T</em> and a button <em>B</em>. Initially, the value in <em>T</em> is “0” and each click of <em>B</em> increases the value in <em>T</em> by one.</p><p>Counter serves as a gentle introduction to the basics of the language, paradigm and toolkit for one of the simplest GUI applications imaginable. Thus, Counter reveals the required scaffolding and how the very basic features work together to build a GUI application. A good solution will have almost no scaffolding.</p><h2>Temperature Converter</h2><p><em>Challenges:</em> bidirectional data flow, user-provided text input.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/tempconv.de9aff1f.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing two textfields <em>T<sub>C</sub></em> <!-- -->and <em>T<sub>F</sub></em> representing the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, respectively. Initially, both <em>T<sub>C</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>F</sub></em> are empty. When the user enters a numerical value into <em>T<sub>C</sub></em> the corresponding value in <em>T<sub>F</sub></em> is automatically updated and vice versa. When the user enters a non-numerical string into <em>T<sub>C</sub></em> the value in <em>T<sub>F</sub></em> is <em>not</em> updated and vice versa. The formula for converting a temperature <em>C</em> in Celsius into a temperature <em>F</em> in Fahrenheit is <em>C = (F - 32) * (5/9)</em> and the dual direction is <em>F = C * (9/5) + 32</em>.</p><p>Temperature Converter increases the complexity of Counter by having bidirectional data flow between the Celsius and Fahrenheit inputs and the need to check the user input for validity. A good solution will make the bidirectional dependency very clear with minimal boilerplate code.</p><p>Temperature Converter is inspired by the<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artima.com/pins1ed/gui-programming.html#32.4">Celsius/Fahrenheit converter</a> <!-- -->from the book <em>Programming in Scala</em>. It is such a widespread example—sometimes also in the form of a currency converter—that one could give a thousand references. The same is true for the Counter task.</p><h2>Flight Booker</h2><p><em>Challenge:</em> Constraints.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/bookflight.a5434663.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing a combobox <em>C</em> with the two options “one-way flight” and “return flight”, two textfields <em>T<sub>1</sub></em> and<!-- --> <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> representing the start and return date, respectively, and a button <em>B</em> for submitting the selected flight. <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> is enabled iff <em>C</em>’s value is “return flight”. When <em>C</em> has the value “return flight” and <em>T<sub>2</sub></em>’s date is strictly before <em>T<sub>1</sub></em>’s then <em>B</em> is disabled. When a non-disabled textfield <em>T</em> has an ill-formatted date then <em>T</em> is colored red and <em>B</em> is disabled. When clicking <em>B</em> a message is displayed informing the user of his selection (e.g. “You have booked a one-way flight on 04.04.2014.”). Initially, <em>C</em> has the value “one-way flight” and <em>T<sub>1</sub></em> as well as <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> have the same (arbitrary) date (it is implied that <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> is disabled).</p><p>The focus of Flight Booker lies on modelling constraints between widgets on the one hand and modelling constraints within a widget on the other hand. Such constraints are very common in everyday interactions with GUI applications. A good solution for Flight Booker will make the constraints clear, succinct and explicit in the source code and not hidden behind a lot of scaffolding.</p><p>Flight Booker is directly inspired by the<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.reactiveprogramming.org/?p=21">Flight Booking Java example in Sodium</a> <!-- -->with the simplification of using textfields for date input instead of specialized date picking widgets as the focus of Flight Booker is not on specialized/custom widgets.</p><h2>Timer</h2><p><em>Challenges:</em> concurrency, competing user/signal interactions, responsiveness.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/timer.ed46b6b4.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing a gauge <em>G</em> for the elapsed time <em>e</em>, a label which shows the elapsed time as a numerical value, a slider <em>S</em> by which the duration <em>d</em> of the timer can be adjusted while the timer is running and a reset button <em>R</em>. Adjusting<!-- --> <em>S</em> must immediately reflect on <em>d</em> and not only when<!-- --> <em>S</em> is released. It follows that while moving <em>S</em> the filled amount of <em>G</em> will (usually) change immediately. When <em>e ≥ d</em> is true then the timer stops (and <em>G</em> will be full). If, thereafter, <em>d</em> is increased such that <em>d &gt; e</em> will be true then the timer restarts to tick until <em>e ≥ d</em> is true again. Clicking <em>R</em> will reset <em>e</em> to zero.</p><p>Timer deals with concurrency in the sense that a timer process that updates the elapsed time runs concurrently to the user’s interactions with the GUI application. This also means that the solution to competing user and signal interactions is tested. The fact that slider adjustments must be reflected immediately moreover tests the responsiveness of the solution. A good solution will make it clear that the signal is a timer tick and, as always, has not much scaffolding.</p><p>Timer is directly inspired by the timer example in the paper<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ick-adapt-oo-fwk-frp/paper.pdf">Crossing State Lines: Adapting Object-Oriented Frameworks to Functional Reactive Languages</a>.</p><h2>CRUD</h2><p><em>Challenges:</em> separating the domain and presentation logic, managing mutation, building a non-trivial layout.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/crud.515ce94b.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing the following elements: a textfield<!-- --> <em>T<sub>prefix</sub></em>, a pair of textfields <em>T<sub>name</sub></em> and<!-- --> <em>T<sub>surname</sub></em>, a listbox <em>L</em>, buttons <em>B<sub>C</sub></em>,<!-- --> <em>B<sub>U</sub></em> and <em>B<sub>D</sub></em> and the three labels as seen in the screenshot. <em>L</em> presents a view of the data in the database that consists of a list of names. At most one entry can be selected in <em>L</em> at a time. By entering a string into <em>T<sub>prefix</sub></em> the user can filter the names whose surname start with the entered prefix—this should happen immediately without having to submit the prefix with enter. Clicking <em>B<sub>C</sub></em> <!-- -->will append the resulting name from concatenating the strings in<!-- --> <em>T<sub>name</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>surname</sub></em> to <em>L</em>.<!-- --> <em>B<sub>U</sub></em> and <em>B<sub>D</sub></em> are enabled iff an entry in <em>L</em> is selected. In contrast to <em>B<sub>C</sub></em>, <em>B<sub>U</sub></em> <!-- -->will not append the resulting name but instead replace the selected entry with the new name. <em>B<sub>D</sub></em> will remove the selected entry. The layout is to be done like suggested in the screenshot. In particular, <em>L</em> must occupy all the remaining space.</p><p>CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) represents a typical graphical business application. The primary challenge is the separation of domain and presentation logic in the source code that is more or less forced on the implementer due to the ability to filter the view by a prefix. Traditionally, some form of MVC pattern is used to achieve the separation of domain and presentation logic. Also, the approach to managing the mutation of the list of names is tested. A good solution will have a good separation between the domain and presentation logic without much overhead (e.g. in the form of toolkit specific concepts or language/paradigm concepts), a mutation management that is fast but not error-prone and a natural representation of the layout (layout builders are allowed, of course, but would increase the overhead).</p><p>CRUD is directly inspired by the crud example in the blog post<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/blog/2012/03/29-frp-three-principles-bidirectional-gui.html">FRP - Three principles for GUI elements with bidirectional data flow</a>.</p><h2>Circle Drawer</h2><p><em>Challenges:</em> undo/redo, custom drawing, dialog control*.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/circledraw.235dfd8b.png"></p><p>The task is to build a frame containing an undo and redo button as well as a canvas area underneath. Left-clicking inside an empty area inside the canvas will create an unfilled circle with a fixed diameter whose center is the left-clicked point. The circle nearest to the mouse pointer such that the distance from its center to the pointer is less than its radius, if it exists, is filled with the color gray. The gray circle is the selected circle <em>C</em>. Right-clicking <em>C</em> will make a popup menu appear with one entry “Adjust diameter..”. Clicking on this entry will open another frame with a slider inside that adjusts the diameter of <em>C</em>. Changes are applied immediately. Closing this frame will mark the last diameter as significant for the undo/redo history. Clicking undo will undo the last significant change (i.e. circle creation or diameter adjustment). Clicking redo will reapply the last undoed change unless new changes were made by the user in the meantime.</p><p>Circle Drawer’s goal is, among other things, to test how good the common challenge of implementing an undo/redo functionality for a GUI application can be solved. In an ideal solution the undo/redo functionality comes for free resp. just comes out as a natural consequence of the language / toolkit / paradigm. Moreover, Circle Drawer tests how dialog control*, i.e. keeping the relevant context between several successive GUI interaction steps, is achieved in the source code. Last but not least, the ease of custom drawing is tested.</p><p><small>* Dialog control is explained in more detail in the paper<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-610/paper11.pdf">Developing GUI Applications: Architectural Patterns Revisited</a> <!-- -->starting on page seven. The term describes the challenge of retaining context between successive GUI operations.</small></p><h2>Cells</h2><p><em>Challenges:</em> change propagation, widget customization, implementing a more authentic/involved GUI application.</p><p><img src="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/cells.9544a72f.png"></p><p>The task is to create a simple but usable spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet should be scrollable. The rows should be numbered from 0 to 99 and the columns from A to Z. Double-clicking a cell <em>C</em> lets the user change <em>C</em>’s formula. After having finished editing the formula is parsed and evaluated and its updated value is shown in <em>C</em>. In addition, all cells which depend on <em>C</em> must be reevaluated. This process repeats until there are no more changes in the values of any cell (change propagation). Note that one should not just recompute the value of every cell but only of those cells that depend on another cell’s changed value. If there is an already provided spreadsheet widget it should not be used. Instead, another similar widget (like JTable in Swing) should be customized to become a reusable spreadsheet widget.</p><p>Cells is a more authentic and involved task that tests if a particular …</p></div></div>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>In this post I'll outline several ways to build containers without the need for Docker itself. I'll use <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS</a> as the case-study, which uses OCI-format container images for its workloads. The easiest way to think about OpenFaaS is as a CaaS platform for <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> which can run microservices, and add in FaaS and event-driven tooling for free.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS.com</a></p>
<p>The first option in the post will show how to use the built-in buildkit option for Docker's CLI, then <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">buildkit</a> stand-alone (on Linux only), followed by Google's container builder, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">Kaniko</a>.</p>
<p>This post covers tooling which can build an image from a Dockerfile, and so anything which limits the user to only Java (jib) or Go (ko) for instance is out of scope. I'll then wrap things up and let you know how to get in touch with suggestions, feedback and your own stories around wants and needs in container tooling.</p>
<h2 id="sowhatswrongwithdocker">So what's wrong with Docker?</h2>
<p>Nothing as such, Docker runs well on armhf, arm64, and on <code>x86_64</code>. The main Docker CLI has become a lot more than build/ship/run, and also lugs around several years of baggage, it now comes bundled with Docker Swarm and EE features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update for Nov 2020: anyone using Docker's set of official base-images should also read: <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/29/preparing-docker-hub-rate-limits.html">Preparing for the Docker Hub Rate Limits</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="alternativestodocker">Alternatives to Docker</h3>
<p>There are a few efforts that attempt to strip "docker" back to its component pieces, the original UX we all fell in love with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> - docker itself now uses containerd to run containers, and has support for enabling buildkit to do highly efficient, caching builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">buildah</a> combination - RedHat / IBM's effort, which uses their own OSS toolchain to generate OCI images. Podman is marketed as being daemonless and rootless, but still ends up having to mount overlay filesystems and use a UNIX socket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch">pouch</a> - from Alibaba, pouch is billed as "An Efficient Enterprise-class Container Engine". It uses containerd just like Docker, and supports both container-level isolation with <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> and "lightweight VMs" such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperhq/runv">runV</a>. There's also more of a <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">focus on image distribution and strong isolation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand-alone buildkit - buildkit was started by <a href="https://twitter.com/tonistiigi?lang=en">Tõnis Tiigi</a> from Docker Inc as a brand new container builder with caching and concurrency in mind. buildkit currently only runs as a daemon, but you will hear people claim otherwise. They are forking the daemon and then killing it after a build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img">img</a> - img was written by <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz">Jess Frazelle</a> and is often quoted in these sorts of guides and is a wrapper for buildkit. That said, I haven't seen traction with it compared to the other options mentioned. The project was quite active <a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img/commits/master">until late 2018 and has only received a few patches since</a>. img claims to be daemonless, but it uses buildkit so is probably doing some trickery there. I hear that <code>img</code> gives a better UX than buildkit's own CLI <code>buildctr</code>, but it should also be noted that img is only released for <code>x86_64</code> and there are no binaries for armhf / arm64.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative to <code>img</code> would be <code>k3c</code> which also includes a runtime component and plans to support ARM architectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/k3c">k3c</a> - Rancher's latest experiment which uses containerd and buildkit to re-create the original, classic, vanilla, lite experience of the original Docker version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all the options, I think that I like k3c the most, but it is very nascient and bundles everything into one binary which is likely to conflict with other software, at present it runs its own embedded containerd and buildkit binaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you're a RedHat customer and paying for support, then you really should use their entire toolchain to get the best value for your money. I checked out some of the examples and saw one that used my "classic" blog post on multi-stage builds. See for yourself which style you prefer <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/demos/buildah_multi_stage.sh">the buildah example</a> vs. <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/mutli-stage-docker-builds">Dockerfile example</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So since we are focusing on the "build" piece here and want to look at relativelt stable options, I'm going to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>buildkit in Docker,</li>
<li>buildkit stand-alone</li>
<li>and kaniko.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above and more are now possible since the OpenFaaS CLI can output a standard "build context" that any builder can work with.</p>
<h2 id="buildatestapp">Build a test app</h2>
<p>Let's start with a Golang HTTP middleware, this is a cross between a function and a microservice and shows off how versatile OpenFaaS can be.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  build-test --prefix=alexellis2
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--lang</code> specifies the build template</li>
<li><code>build-test</code> is the name of the function</li>
<li><code>--prefix</code> is the Docker Hub username to use for pushing up our OCI image</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll get the following created:</p>
<pre><code>./
├── build-test
│   └── handler.go
└── build-test.yml

1 directory, 2 files
</code></pre>
<p>The handler looks like this, and is easy to modify. Additional dependencies can be added through vendoring or <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">Go modules</a>.</p>
<pre><code>package function

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

func Handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var input []byte

	if r.Body != nil {
		defer r.Body.Close()

		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)

		input = body
	}

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Hello world, input was: %s", string(input))))
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="buildthenormalway">Build the normal way</h3>
<p>The normal way to build this app would be:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml
</code></pre>
<p>A local cache of the template and Dockerfile is also available at <code>./template/golang-middleware/Dockerfile</code></p>
<p>There are three images that are pulled in for this template:</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.12
</code></pre>
<p>With the traditional builder, each of the images will be pulled in sequentially.</p>
<p>The wait a few moments and you're done, we now have that image in our local library.</p>
<p>We can also push it up to a registry with <code>faas-cli push -f build-test.yml</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/seq.png" alt="seq"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitanddocker">Build with Buildkit and Docker</h3>
<p>This is the easiest change of all to make, and gives a fast build too.</p>
<pre><code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 faas-cli build -f build-test.yml

<p>We'll see that with this approach, the Docker daemon automatically switches out its builder for buildkit.</p>
<p>Buildkit offers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More sophisticated caching</li>
<li>Running later instructions first, when possible - i.e. downloading the "runtime" image, before the build in the "sdk" layer is even completed</li>
<li>Super fast when building a second time</li>
</ul>
<p>With buildkit, all of the base images can be pulled in to our local library at once, since the FROM (download) commands are not executed sequentially.</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.11
</code></pre>
<p>This option works even on a Mac, since buildkit is proxied via the Docker daemon running in the VM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/dkit.png" alt="dkit"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitstandalone">Build with Buildkit standalone</h3>
<p>To build with Buildkit in a stand-alone setup we need to run buildkit separately on a Linux host, so we can't use a Mac.</p>
<p><code>faas-cli build</code> would normally execute or fork <code>docker</code>, because the command is just a wrapper. So to bypass this behaviour we should write out a build context, that's possible via the following command:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml --shrinkwrap

[0] &gt; Building build-test.
Clearing temporary build folder: ./build/build-test/
Preparing ./build-test/ ./build/build-test//function
Building: alexellis2/build-test:latest with golang-middleware template. Please wait..
build-test shrink-wrapped to ./build/build-test/
[0] &lt; Building build-test done in 0.00s.
[0] Worker done.

Total build time: 0.00
</code></pre>
<p>Our context is now available in the <code>./build/build-test/</code> folder with our function code and the template with its entrypoint and Dockerfile.</p>
<pre><code>./build/build-test/
├── Dockerfile
├── function
│   └── handler.go
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── template.yml

1 directory, 5 files
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to run buildkit, we can build from source, or grab upstream binaries.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLf https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/download/v0.6.3/buildkit-v0.6.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/ --strip-components=1
</code></pre>
<p>If you checkout the releases page, you'll also find buildkit available for armhf and arm64, which is great for multi-arch.</p>
<p>Run the buildkit daemon in a new window:</p>
<pre><code>sudo buildkitd 
WARN[0000] using host network as the default            
INFO[0000] found worker "l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy", labels=map[org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.executor:oci org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.hostname:nuc org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.snapshotter:overlayfs], platforms=[linux/amd64 linux/386] 
WARN[0000] skipping containerd worker, as "/run/containerd/containerd.sock" does not exist 
INFO[0000] found 1 workers, default="l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy" 
WARN[0000] currently, only the default worker can be used. 
INFO[0000] running server on /run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock 
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's start a build, passing in the shrink-wrapped location as the build-context. The command we want is <code>buildctl</code>, buildctl is a client for the daemon and will configure how to build the image and what to do when it's done, such as exporting a tar, ignoring the build or pushing it to a registry.</p>
<pre><code>buildctl build --help
NAME:
   buildctl build - build

USAGE:
   
  To build and push an image using Dockerfile:
    $ buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
  

OPTIONS:
   --output value, -o value  Define exports for build result, e.g. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
   --progress value          Set type of progress (auto, plain, tty). Use plain to show container output (default: "auto")
   --trace value             Path to trace file. Defaults to no tracing.
   --local value             Allow build access to the local directory
   --frontend value          Define frontend used for build
   --opt value               Define custom options for frontend, e.g. --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar
   --no-cache                Disable cache for all the vertices
   --export-cache value      Export build cache, e.g. --export-cache type=registry,ref=example.com/foo/bar, or …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

<h2>Spreading the “gospel” to the world</h2>
<p>If you deeply believe something, along the lines of “if everyone did it, the world would be much better off.” and have tried convincing other people to do that thing, then you will realize it’s almost impossible to change others’ opinions or behaviors.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not that ambitious to convince everyone, so you start small: you share it with your friends, but then discovered nobody actually cares or realizes its significance. A mild version is like <a href="https://www.deathbulge.com/comics/206">showing your favorite TV show and they don’t care</a>:</p>

<p>My faith in evidence-based learning strategies is informed by my personal experience and <a href="https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-02-25-how-to-learn-about-meta-learning-my-resource-list">my meta-learning list</a>. I wholeheartedly believe Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) like SuperMemo and Anki is the key to effective and efficient learning. If you believe education is the future, then the knowledge about evidence-based learning strategies is one big key to unlocking that future, both individually and collectively.</p>
<h2>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</h2>
<p>Two years ago I was doing my Anki reps. One friend glanced over and was interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>We ate lunch together while I was giving her a little presentation. I talked <em>very enthusiastically</em> about spaced repetition, basic memory science and Anki operations. Of course I had to show her the infamous forgetting curve:</p>

<p>She sounded excited about the possibility of finally mastering a second language. But at one point she was confused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I hadn’t learned it how could I recall it from memory?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I explained that assessment <strong>for</strong> learning (testing as a means of learning) is different from assessment <strong>of</strong> learning (finding out what you’ve learned). The act of “recalling from memory” is itself a learning process. Then I was aware that her confusion was probably due to a common misconception about memory: human memory works like computer memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional architecture of how humans forget, remember, and learn is <strong>unlike</strong> the corresponding processes in man-made devices […] We think of ourselves as working like computers, we become prone to assuming that exposing ourselves to information and procedures will lead to storage (i.e., recording) of such information or procedures in our memories—that the information will write itself in one’s memory.</p>
<p>If we think of human memory equals to memory in a computer, we are unlikely to appreciate that retrieving information from our memory increases the subsequent accessibility of that information, while retrieving information from computer memory leaves the status of that information unperturbed. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203842539/chapters/10.4324%2F9780203842539-6">On the Symbiosis of Remembering, Forgetting, and Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note: this story might give you the impression that I liked to show off what I know. No not really. I like to be convinced with evidence, and I thought others were the same. I was wrong. Also, I included the above quotes for the sake of convincing you, the reader. I didn’t obfuscate the subject matter further with phrases like assessment <strong>for</strong> learning and assessment <strong>of</strong> learning.</p>
<p>She looked… befuddled. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>I remember I was so excited and nervous at the same time that I was fumbling for words, trying to simplify it as much as I could. In retrospect, I was making things worse.</p>
<p>She’d listen to me quite intently, signaling that she was thinking and trying to figure it out, but I could tell she was still confused. And the more I explained, the deeper the rabbit hole went (like keep clicking hyperlinks in Wikipedia), and the more confused she became, so I stopped talking to stop making the whole situation uncomfortable. The following monologue is how I imagine what she was thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s so passionate about this stuff and so sure of himself that I guess he’s right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure what he means. I do want to learn Japanese but the stuff he’s talking about is so confusing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was indeed interested in the beginning, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just going to pretend I understand and end this whole conversation asap.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what she said at one point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like “Yeah…” I never followed up on her progress. I figured if she was truly interested, when she bumped into problem she would ask for my help. As expected, we never talked about it and I never mentioned Anki again.</p>

<p>These has happened countless times. I usually look nonchalant on the outside but dying on the inside. People looked interested (probably due to my enthusiasm and it’s impolite to look otherwise) and then never actually bothered to use Anki. Some would actually try, make a few cards, do the reps for a few days and then say, “I tried and Anki doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I’m probably over my head, but sometimes it feels like I’m personally attacked, that what I’m saying is not valuable. I understand it’s not true, but it took me years to study the learning science and to gain the experience with Anki/SuperMemo. The fact that they’re dismissing the software feels like they’re dismissing my knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2>The problems of giving advice on how to learn</h2>
<h3>#1. Nobody cares <em>that</em> much, alright?</h3>
<p>When I first discovered Anki I was like, “How come no one around me knows this?! I need to share this to everyone!” So I would tell my friends about Anki but nobody was interested. I’ve introduced Anki to people and every time it’s a very frustrating experience. (Surprise surprise, not SuperMemo. The learning curve of Anki is much lower. What chance do I have if I preached SuperMemo when they even think Anki is too hard to use?)</p>
<p>Update: I was never a missionary and randomly went out my way to tell people about Anki all the time like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com/">Source</a></p>
<p>Very early on I did give unsolicited advice once to my best friend by intentionally bringing up Anki. Then I did bring up Anki on multiple occasions, but only when the opportunity presented itself, like the story above.</p>
<p>People may be interested in how you’ve developed a skill or become fluent in a foreign language, but just not <strong>that</strong> interested. And they certainly don’t expect to be suddenly lectured on how learning and memory work.</p>
<p>I never liked following up to people with questions like “So how’s Anki? Have you used it?” It feels like pushing an agenda to them. Also, since most would not even bother buying and downloading the app, their response is usually, “I forgot about it. I’ll do it later.” and the conversation would end in an awkward tone.</p>
<h3>#2. I’m not sure if I actually want it, alright?</h3>
<p>Sometimes people keep lamenting “I want to learn X or I want to get better grades.” How many times do you hear people say they want to learn a second language? This is like that friend who keeps saying “I want to lose weight”. Probably after all, they’re just lamenting and not yet ready to put in the effort to change.</p>
<p>Trying to convince others to use Anki/SuperMemo is like trying to convince your friends to go to the gym regularly. You can talk about the benefits of exercising/weight-lifting, how good you’ll feel afterwards, how much more productive you’ll be and so on. But nothing will work if they don’t try it in the first place, and it doesn’t help that spaced repetition doesn’t work in the short-term since using Spaced Repetition Software is a life-long pursuit (just as learning is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp; vivid. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern’s Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>#3. Why are you so hyped about it?</h3>
<p>It’s rare if people could understand and realize the significance and application of Spaced Repetition Software in a casual 10-min chat. It’s not about the complexity (it’s not rocket science after all), but rather it’s about awareness: problems with current learning approaches and how Anki/SuperMemo could solve the problems. In other words, if I don’t see the problems, why bother changing?</p>
<p>I have a friend who was learning German. She copied German vocabulary on one side and the equivalent English on the other in a notebook. I showed her my Korean Anki cards: “Take a look at these beautiful images! Gifs! Sentence cards! Audio clips! Mass Immersion Approach! (Former: All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)), Stephen Krashen’s Input Hypothesis!” Then I had another friend who was studying to become a nurse. I told him about Anki: “Image occlusion for anatomy!” It felt wrong of me to be hiding Anki (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">Image Occlusion</a> to be specific) from him. Deep down I want to shove their faces to this table:</p>

<p>I was exaggerating but you get the point: it’s not possible to convey the significance and application of it all in a casual 10-min chat. With the benefit of hindsight, all my attempts could’ve been a lot better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I was so convinced and have so much faith in Spaced Repetition Software that I came off as condescending, giving off the impression like “you don’t know how to study; let me teach you.”</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the bold claims: “You’ll get 2x results with half the study time.” (How many are really true whenever you hear such claim?)</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the situation: all he or she wants is someone to listen about the difficulty of studying, not some real advice or suggestions.</li>

    <div id="ExplainGitCommit-Container">
      <p>
        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git branch</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitDeleteBranches-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch -d</span> is used to delete branches.
        I have pre-created a bunch of branches for you to delete in the playground below.
        Have at it.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFree-Container">
      <p>
        Do whatever you want in this free playground.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Simple Image Vectorization]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">
    
    <p>
It's especially useful when you want to turn a satellite photo into a map. Or if you want to scan some blueprint and turn it into a CAD model. Or if you want to reissue an old game and you don't want to redraw all the artwork from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
The algorithm I'm going to show you has nothing to do with all these things. It's a basic vectorization technique which, in its original form, has little to none applications in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
On the plus side, it illustrates the approach rather well. It shows how things like bilinear interpolation, gradient descent, and parametric splines work together to solve a real-world problem. At the very least, it makes learning about all these things a little more compelling.
    </p>

    <h2>
An input image
    </h2>
    <p>
A raster image is essentially a rectangular table of things. If it's a full-color RGB, then it's a table of color pixels. Color pixels are the triplets of 8-bit integer values where each value represents an amount of red, green, and blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
Medical images, such as obtained from computed tomography, are usually the tables of 12-bit or 16-bit integers. It's not a color really since the values come from invisible X-ray radiation, but they are called gray values nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
Satellite images may have a lot of channels. Apart from the colors of the visible specter they may contain ultra-violet and infra-red luminosity. Channels may be represented by integers or floating point values.
    </p>
    <p>
Our image will be a simple gray-scale bitmap.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Technically, we can already turn it into vectors rather easily. Let's just agree on some threshold, and mark the contour of all the pixels that have the values exceeding this threshold.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas_contour" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Well, it's simple, but it's not what we wanted. We want curves, not corners. And for that, we have to make our image less cornery.
    </p>
    <h2>
<span id="index_image_interpolation">Image interpolation</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's say our image is not a table of values. Let's say we only know the values in the centers of the pixels, and we have to guess the values between them somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
This is called interpolation. The simplest case would be the nearest neighbor interpolation, where for every point on an image, the value is the value from the nearest pixel's center. But this simply turns it back into a table.
    </p>
    <p>
A little more advanced is the <span id="index_bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</span>. The value is the linear sum of the four neighboring values. It looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_1">// pixel value with out of bounds checks
function pixel_in(pixels, i, j) {
    if(i &gt;= pixels.length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, pixels.length-1, j);
    if(i &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, 0, j);
    if(j &gt;= pixels[0].length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, pixels[0].length-1);
    if(j &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, 0);
    return pixels[i][j];
}

// linear interpolation
function value_in(pixels, x, y) {
    var j = Math.floor(x - 0.5);
    var tj = x - 0.5 - j;
    var i = Math.floor(y - 0.5);
    var ti = y - 0.5 - i;
    return pixel_in(pixels, i, j) * (1 - ti) * (1 - tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i, j+1) * (1 - ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j+1) * (ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j) * (ti) * (1 - tj);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
If we darken the pixels where the interpolated value meets the threshold, we'll get some kind of a contour.
    </p>
    <canvas id="interpolation_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    
    <p>
There are other methods. Plenty of them. But linear interpolation solves the cornery border problem just fine. Although, the border we see is just the borderline of some threshold. It's not a vector representation yet.
    </p>

    <h2>
Turning an interpolated image into a contour
    </h2>
    <p>
We can borrow an idea from the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_simplest_possible_smooth_contouring_algorithm.html">simplest possible smooth contouring</a> algorithm. We'll build an initial border from the source pixels, and then we'll use our linearly interpolated image to find the best place to put each contour point so the image value will meet the threshold value.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have a <span id="index_distance_field">distance field</span>, it's easy. A distance field is when for any point in space you can tell how far it lies from the surface you want. It's basically a function from point in space to distance.
    </p>
    <p>
You take its gradient, take the difference between the value you have and the threshold value. Since it's the distance field, the value difference is exactly the distance you should move your point for. And the gradient is the exact opposite direction. You just inverse, multiply, add — and you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a distance field. We have a continuous image which only resembles one.
    </p>
    <p>
But the principle still works. If you traverse against the gradient, you will get closer to the threshold value. And the more the difference, the further you have to go. It's just you wouldn't always get there in one try.
    </p>
    <p>
So let's try several times then. Let's make an <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_introduction_to_iterative_algorithms.html">iterative algorithm</a> out of it.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_2">// gradient
function gradient(pixels, x, y) {
    const eps = 1e-5;
    return [(value_in(pixels, x + eps, y) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps,
            (value_in(pixels, x, y + eps) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps];
}

// how far should you shift the point to meet the isoline
// if value_in were a distance function
function gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, x, y) {
    var g = gradient(pixels, x, y);
    var g_norm = Math.sqrt(g[0]*g[0] + g[1]*g[1]);
    var d = threshold - value_in(pixels, x, y);
    return [g[0] * d / g_norm / g_norm, g[1] * d / g_norm / g_norm];
}

// brings a point closer to the threshold isoline
function fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, point) {
    const ok_error = 1/255;
    if(Math.abs(value_in(pixels, point[0], point[1]) - threshold) &lt; ok_error)
        return point;
    gs = gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, point[0], point[1])
    var new_point = [point[0] + gs[0], point[1] + gs[1]];
    return fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, new_point);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
We'll move our contour points against the gradient until we're close enough to the threshold
    </p>
    <canvas id="fitting_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
        
    <p>
That's good but we can do better. Let's make the contour smooth.
    </p>

    <h2>
Cubic splines
    </h2>
    <p>
All we have to do to make the contour smooth is to turn each line segment into a parametric cubic curve.
    </p>
    <p>
It's probably sounds more complicated than it is. A parametric cubic curve is just a pair of polynomials. If you have the points and partial derivatives in this points, you can get the coefficients for them from this pair of <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/programmers_introduction_to_linear_equations.html">linear systems</a>:
    </p>
    <div><p>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dx<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = x<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = x<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dx<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p><p>
    
Py(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dy<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Py(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = y<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = y<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dy<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p></div>
    <p>
The curve itself will then look like this.
    </p>
    <canvas id="cubic_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Even more, since we get to choose the parameter range, we can make it [0..1]. This greatly simplifies our system and makes it really easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the function that makes one array of polynomial coefficients from two pairs of point and tangent values.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_3">// solver specific to [0..1] parametrized splines
function spline_for(p1, p1d, p2, p2d) {
//     A = [
//         [1, 0, 0, 0],
//         [0, 1, 0, 0],
//         [1, 1, 1, 1],
//         [0, 1, 2, 3]];
//     B = [p1, p1d, p2, p2d]
    return [
        p1,
        p1d,
        3*p2 - p2d - 3*p1 - 2*p1d,
        p2d + p1d - 2*p2 + 2*p1
    ];
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
The polynomial is then computed in every <i>t</i> with this function.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_4">// polynomial
function polynomial_in_t(A, t){
    var pt = 0.0;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; A.length; ++i){
        pt += A[i] * Math.pow(x, i);
    }
    return pt;
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
So for every line segment with tangents, we can make a parametric polynomial. There is one problem though. We don't have tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
We have the gradient, which is orthogonal to the tangent, but there are two possible tangents in every point. The tangent can be oriented left or right from the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
But this is solvable. Let's just pick the direction we like and keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
Let the curves that originally come from horizontally oriented segments always have both tangents that way that <i>dx &gt; 0</i>. And the ones that come from vertically oriented segments, will have <i>dy &gt; 0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
It looks like we have enough parts to assemble an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>
Creating splines from the pixels
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's split our vectorization into two parts. First, we'll get points and tangents for every line segment from the pixels. Then we'll turn it all into polynomial splines.
    </p>
    <p>
The function that does the first part looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_5">function turn_pixels_into_points_and_tangents(pixels, threshold) {
    var points = [];
    var tangents = [];

    // "horizontal" pieces
    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= pixels.length; i += 1) {
        var old_point = [];
        var old_tangent = [];
        for(var j = 0; j &lt;= pixels[0].length; j += 1) {
            // if right, left, top, and bottom pixels have a sign change,
            // there should be a spline there
            var sign_change_on_the_right  =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j+0) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_left   =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j-1) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j-1) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_bottom =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j-1) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;
            var sign_change_on_the_top    =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j-1) - threshold) *

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="str-vOKpYe5nW" data-connect-field="content"><p>Spreadsheet services like Google Sheets or Airtable have already used by many people, teams, and companies. What makes them more interesting is, they introduce non-tech users to the no-code movement, open doors for interesting possibilities.</p><p>No-code is like Starbuck, a kind of coffee also for people who don’t drink coffee. What great about Starbuck isn’t the taste, but it allows more people to enjoy coffee. In other words, <strong>no-code is a programming language for non-programmers</strong>.</p><p>Recently, I’ve examined using Google Sheet as a database service when integrating to <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Inverr</a> — a no-code builder. It can possibly operate for sites or apps with less than 5M visits/month, with big enough data storage for small apps. Though, it comes with some limitations.</p><p>In this post, I’ll address a few technical issues when using Google Sheets as a database service, its effects, and how to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-search-is-inconvenient">1. Search is Inconvenient</h3><p>The main functions of the database are store, retrieve, and search for data. While Google Sheets is doing excellent at storing and retrieving data, the searching part in Google Sheets is a bit tricky.</p><p>On many apps, search provides discoverability. For example, when you’re building a movie discovery app, users search a movie by name, filter by a category, or popularity. Without search, the movie app is no different than a movie list.</p><p>To use the searching feature, Google Sheets APIs provide a property called “developerMetadata”. It’s an additional data on each cell, and invisible to Google Sheets users. When searching, it will use these additional data.</p><p>“developerMetadata” has a <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fsheets%2Fapi%2Fguides%2Fmetadata%23metadata_storage_limits">limit</a> of 30,000 characters for each spreadsheet. It’s too small to do anything great. Though, you can optimize for sentence, paragraph by only store important terms.</p><h3 id="2-quota-and-storagenbsplimits">2. Quota and Storage&nbsp;Limits</h3><p>Google Sheets has a storage limit at 5,000,000 cells (including blank ones), and up to 256 columns per sheet.</p><p>Let’s take an example as a movie discovery app, it needs at least 6 properties (id, title, description, release date, rating, category). As a rough estimation, you can only store up to 5,000,000 / 6 = <strong>~833k movies</strong>. Since there are currently <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fpressroom%2Fstats%2F">555,913 movies</a> released, in theory, it’s still acceptable.</p><p>Another limitation when using Google Sheet APIs is its request quota. Starting at 500 requests per 100 seconds (or 5 requests per second), and start charging when excessed. In many cases, using proper caching techniques will reduce the number of requests to Google Cloud APIs services.</p><h3 id="3-acceptable-performance-on-a-largenbspdataset">3. Acceptable Performance on a Large&nbsp;Dataset</h3><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HrJxokwIWMsvLqb_4KFB6Q.png" alt=""></p><p><em>Query Performance Google&nbsp;Sheets</em></p><p>This is an unrealistic measure, but to test the limit and get a better overview, I tried getting data from a spreadsheet with a large dataset.</p><p>The above graph demonstrates the performance of retrieving thousands of cells per second from Google Sheets. It took around 2 seconds when getting 100k cells all at once, which 100k / 6 = ~16k movies. This is acceptable performance, and grows as the number of cells grows.</p><h3 id="4-no-schema-and-proper-restriction">4. No Schema and Proper Restriction</h3><p>Google Sheets is like a database with its own presentation. For example, you have a spreadsheet for monthly expenses. It contains a list of expenses, their category. And in the end, it can have a <strong>total expense value</strong> by the sum of all expenses in the month.</p><p>The layout freedom is convenient when using it as a spreadsheet, but a nightmare for a database. Because there is always some kind of fixed layout that the database follows. It allows the database engine to calculate the distance and navigate between rows of data. And no database designed without a layout.</p><p>Besides, unless you decided that no-one will ever touch the spreadsheet, someone might accidentally screw it up by renaming the tab or remove it.</p><hr><p>To conclude, Google Sheets is widely used as a tool. But as a database, it comes with some limitations. With proper caching and optimization, it is safe to use it as a database for webs/apps with &lt; 5.000.000 visits monthly.</p><p>Besides, its search limitation can be a huge bottleneck in many scenarios. You can use “developerMetadata” to enable data lookup. With 30k characters limits, it’s a good practice to store only “meta” data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Try to build a website with Google Sheet, or your own database →</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are fine. They are decently designed and well standardized, they provide a good compromise between performance and precision. They work great most of the time. Until the day when they suddenly don't and nobody knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
For me, that day came when I encountered a bug in the Taubin estimator. <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-01-fall/Papers/taubin-smoothing.pdf">Taubin smoothing</a> takes a triangle mesh, a pair of magic numbers called λ and μ, a little time to think, and it makes the input mesh smooth. It also makes sure that the mesh isn't reduced to a perfectly smooth but rather uninteresting sphere or a point.
	</p>
	<p>
The first magic number λ is something between 0 and 1. When it's 0 — nothing happens at all, and when it's 1 — nothing good happens either. It should be somewhere in between. Nobody really knows how to pick this number but an experienced engineer can at least make an educated guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
The second magic number governs shrinkage compensation. It's a negative number slightly greater than λ in its absolute value. Nobody knows how to pick it either but this time even an educated guess is a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
That's why you need an estimator. Something that picks the μ for you. And we have one. And it was bugged. And I was the one to fix it.
	</p>
	<p>
The first day of the investigation showed that the estimator is in fact entirely correct. The second day of the investigation  showed that the tests covering the bug are correct just as well. The third day of the investigation brought a promising hypothesis that the whole story is just a bad dream and all it takes to solve the mystery is to wake up. The fourth morning killed that hypothesis and left me completely clueless.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily I have a friend who is smarter than me and he advised to fuzz the input a little and see what happens then. I did. And something happened. The bug didn't go away but the μ changed a lot. Way unproportionally to the small changes in the input. Fascinating!
	</p>
	<p>
We can expect a computation to work with some error. It's fine, we get input data from sensors and they embed some error, to begin with. We print out our finished models, and the printers have some limited precision as well so a small error doesn't upset anyone. It's all good while the error is small. But what if it isn't?
	</p>
	<p>
As it turns out, in my case, a completely correct algorithm had a computational error of about 1. Not 1e-16 or 1e-5 but 1. Just 1. So if you expect your μ to be somewhat close to -0.7, and the estimator says it's 0.3, it is in fact correct. It is still a correct estimation within its error range.
	</p>
	<p>
Correct but entirely useless.
	</p>
	<h2>
Challenge your intuition with a “Guess the Error” game
	</h2>
	<p>
Ok, so it's not the computational error per se that causes trouble but only the unexpected and unpredictable error. Can we predict it though?
	</p>
	<p>
Well, of course, we can. There is a whole field of numerical error analysis for that but let's be honest, most of the time we use our intuition instead. So how good is our intuition exactly?
	</p>
	<p>
I propose a game to find out. Let's take a cubic equation solver. It's a relatively complex computation with a very simple way to validate its precision. We will pick some roots first and then we will generate the cubic equation for these roots. Then we'll make the cubic solver find our roots back through the computation. The difference between the original and the computed value for each root will be our measurable error. This error divided by the original value will be our relative error.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the exact code for the experiment. It's also <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/master/exp/rational_bounds/rationale/cubic_solver_example.cpp">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
Now if we pick our roots as 1, 2, and 3, the equation produced will be:
	</p>
	<p>
(x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) = 0
	</p>
	<p>
Expanding the brackets we get this:
	</p>
	<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 6 = 0
	</p>
	<p>
And when we run our solver we get:
	</p>
	<p>
x = 1, x = 2, x = 3
	</p>
	<p>
Well, yes. On the equation this simple there is no error whatsoever. The computation works flawlessly. So let's start making it worse.
	</p>
	<h2>Round 1</h2>
	<p>
The slider below lets you pick an interval in the logarithmic scale. The interval may start at 10<sup>-12</sup> and end at 10<sup>12</sup>. It's impossible to predict the exact error up to a single number so you should just pick an appropriate interval that covers the error<span id="shown_note_1"><u onclick="show('note_1')">*</u>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say we have the roots of 0.001, 2, 3 000. So to which interval, in your opinion, the maximum relative error for a cubic solver belongs?
	</p>

	<h2>Round 2</h2>
	<p>
Now let's make our roots even more diverse in magnitude. How about 1e-6, 2, and 3e6?
	</p>
	<p>
Where do you think the error might be?

	<p>
It's not the error per se that is bad. Error is omnipresent. Every measuring device has its error, every 3D printer and every milling machine has its maximal precision. The error is fine.
	</p>
	<p>
It's only the unpredictability that makes it unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
People address errors in multiple ways. In metrology, a measured value is supplemented with its absolute error. You don't say that the temperature outside is 10°, you say it's 10° ± 0.5°. This might seem redundant since this is a small error for the weather outside, but in some other context, this very error might become significant. If you're measuring body temperature, a 1-degree difference is enough to tell a sick person from a perfectly healthy one. You can not afford a whole 1-degree error in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have this input error written down, you can pull it through your computation to see if the resulting error is still tolerable. To do that, you need to exchange your measured numbers for intervals. A number with error becomes an interval: 10° ± 0.5° becomes [9.5, 10.5]°.
	</p>
	<p>
You can sum these intervals just as you add numbers:
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_4" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
+
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_5" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_6" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
You can multiply them as well.
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_7" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
×
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_8" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_9" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
So with intervals, you can accommodate the input error. You can drag it through the computation and see how it plays with other values with their own error. In the end, you will have your computed value within some interval and the size of this interval will indicate the output error. But what about the error of the computation itself?
	</p>
	<p>
A computational error occurs when we can't store the operation result in the same types we keep our operands in and we're forced to throw some data away. Let's say we have Python-style “unlimited” length integers. This means that if our computation only consists of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we would never face any computational error.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, with division, things get a little bit different. E. g. we can't store <nobr>16 ¾</nobr> in integers so we have to truncate it into 16. In this case, the whole fractional part becomes our error.
	</p>
	<p>
We can use pairs of integers to represent rational numbers. This will solve the division issue. However, this type of rational number, while does not accumulate errors, accumulates digits. The more digits it has, the slower the computation goes. At some point, it may simply become impractically slow. Just like with the uncontrollable error, uncontrollable size becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
We want a compromise. Some entity that grows error controllably yet still operates in constant speed. And we can get it, for example, by merging two ideas: intervals and rational numbers together.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say, we want to write a number as an interval of its tenths. We can do that most intuitively by throwing away all the digits after the first one.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Just like we can do this with decimal fraction, we can do this with any rational number. We can put it between a pair of rational numbers made by finite integers. In this case, every integer is in the range [0, 1, ..., 99].
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Ok, this is not entirely true. If the number is greater than 99, then we can't really store it in our tiny rationals but we can say that it's larger than 99 by assigning the 0 divisor to its upper bound. Of course, it's just a dirty hack but let's leave it like that.
	</p>
	<p>
Now if we want to accommodate both input error and computational error, all we have to do is to represent an input interval in its finite rational numbers. A finite rational lower bound of this interval and a finite rational upper bound of the same interval.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
This entity — a pair of finite rational bounds, represents a real number along with both its input error and representational error. It also grows computational error explicitly while the size of the entity remains constant.
	</p>
	<p>
The implementation example is <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/tree/master/exp/rational_bounds/sketch_in_cpp">available on GitHub</a>. Please note that it's just a proof of concept and not the best possible solution in terms of neither error minimization nor speed.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
The computational error may become a problem at the least appropriate moment. Both rational numbers and intervals are well-known alternatives for floating-point numbers when the error becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
Rational bounds, being a chimeric product of both ideas, let you manage both measurement error and computational error in a coherent way without compromising performance all that much.

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting desination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia ala Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application-level_gateway">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>In the context of computer networking, an application-level 
gateway consists of a security component that augments a 
firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows 
customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the 
gateway to support address and port translation for certain 
application layer "control/data" protocols such as FTP, 
BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. 
In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a 
firewall, either the application has to know about an address/
port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the 
NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port 
mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. 
Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the 
security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have 
otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited 
filter criteria.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="router-investigation--firmware-dumping">Router Investigation / Firmware Dumping</h2>

<p>I'd first like to see how common gateways actually treat packets and multi-port protocols like FTP, SIP, etc. To do this, we’ll want to reverse engineer the firmware from common routers. We could dump the flash from physical routers, however if we can get unencrypted firmware from the manufacturers, we’ll be able to investigate more router models and much faster.</p>

<p>We'll start with a common router, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/NjZh">quick search</a> helps us …</p></div></div>

              <p>Whether you’re using logistic regression or a neural network, all models require data in order to be trained, tested, and deployed. Managing and creating the data sets used for these models requires lots of time and space, and can quickly become muddled due to multiple users altering and updating the data.</p><p>This can lead to unexpected outcomes as data scientists continue to release new versions of the models but test against different data sets. Many data scientists could be training and developing models on the same few sets of training data.

This is because Git was developed to track changes in text files, not large binary files. So if a team's training data sets involve large audio or video files, this can cause a lot of problems downstream. Each change to the training data set will often result in a duplicated data set in the repositories’ history. This not only creates a large repository but also makes cloning and rebasing very slow.</p><h2 id="data-versioning-management">Data Versioning Management</h2><p>When trying to manage versions, whether it be code or UIs, there is a widespread tendency— even among techies—to “manage versions,” by adding a version number or word to the end of a file name. In the context of data, this means a project might include data.csv, data_v1.csv, data_v2.csv, data_v3_finalversion.csv, etc. This bad habit is beyond cliché, with most developers, data scientists, and UI experts in fact starting out<em> </em>with bad versioning habits.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Nine Eight Seven" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@steve_j?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Steve Johnson</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h2><p>When working in a production environment, one of the greatest challenges is dealing with other data scientists. If you’re not using some form of version control in a collaborative environment, files will get deleted, altered, and moved; and you will never know who did what. In addition, it will be difficult to revert your data to its original state. This is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to managing models and datasets.</p><p>Data versioning is one of the keys to automating a team's machine learning model development.

It also helps teams manage their pipelines and machine learning models. In the end, DVC will help improve your team's consistency and the <a href="https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/">reproducibility of your models</a>.</p><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight, open-source, and usable across all major cloud platforms and storage types.</li><li>Flexible, format and framework agnostic, and easy to implement.</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>DVC version control is tightly coupled with pipeline management. This means if your team is already using another data pipeline tool, there will be redundancy.</li><li>DVC is lightweight, which means your team might need to manually develop extra features to make it easy to use.</li></ul><h2 id="delta-lake">Delta Lake</h2><p><a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake</a> is an open-source storage layer to help improve data lakes. It does so by providing ACID transactions, data versioning, metadata management, and managing data versions.</p><p>The tool is closer to a data lake abstraction layer, filling in the gaps where most data lakes are limited.</p><h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3><ul><li>Offers many features that might not be included in your current data storage system, such as ACID transactions or effective metadata management.</li><li>Reduces the need for hands-on data version management and dealing with other data issues, allowing developers to focus on building products on top of their data lakes instead.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3><ul><li>Delta Lake is often overkill for most projects as it was developed to operate on Spark and on big data.</li><li>Requires using a dedicated data format which means it is less flexible and not agnostic to your current formats.</li><li>Tool’s primary purpose is to act more like a data abstraction layer, which might not be what your team needs and can detour developers in need of a lighter solution.</li></ul><h2 id="git-lfs">Git LFS</h2><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs">Git LFS</a> is an extension of Git developed by a number of open-source contributors. The software aims to eliminate large files that may be added into your repository (e.g., photos and data sets) by using pointers instead.</p><p>The pointers are lighter weight and point to the LFS store. Thus when you push your repo into the main repository, it doesn’t take long to update and doesn’t take up too much space.</p><p>This is a very lightweight option when it comes to managing data.</p><h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3><ul><li>Integrates easily into most companies' development workflows.</li><li>Utilizes the same permissions as the Git repository so there is no need for additional permission management.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3><ul><li>Git LFS requires dedicated servers for storing your data. This, in turn, eventually leads to your data science teams being locked in as well as increased engineering work.</li><li>Git LFS servers are not meant to scale, unlike DVC, which stores data into a more general easy-to-scale object storage like S3.</li><li>Very specific and may require using a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><h2 id="pachyderm">Pachyderm</h2><p><a href="https://pachyderm.io/">Pachyderm </a>is one of the few data science platforms on this list. Pachyderm’s aim is to create a platform that makes it easy to reproduce the results of machine learning models by managing the entire data workflow. In this regard, Pachyderm is “the Docker of data.”</p><p>Pachyderm leverages Docker containers to package up your execution environment. This makes it easy to reproduce the same output. The combination of both versioned data and Docker makes it easy for data scientists and DevOps teams to deploy models and ensure their consistency.</p><p>Pachyderm has committed itself to its <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/dsbor/">Data Science Bill of Rights</a>, which outlines the product’s main goals: reproducibility, data provenance, collaboration, incrementality, and autonomy, and infrastructure abstraction.</p><p>These pillars drive many of its features and allow teams to take full advantage of the tool.</p><h3 id="pros-3">Pros</h3><ul><li>Based on containers, which makes your data environments portable and easy to migrate to different cloud providers.</li><li>Robust and can scale from relativity small to very large systems.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-3">Cons</h3><ul><li>More of a learning curve due to so many moving parts, such as the Kubernetes server required to manage Pachyderm’s free version.</li><li>With all the various technical components, it can be difficult to integrate Pachyderm into a company’s existing infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="dolt">Dolt</h2><p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/">Dolt</a> is a unique solution as far as data versioning goes. Unlike some of the other options presented that simply version data, Dolt is a database.</p><p>Dolt is an SQL database with Git-style versioning. Unlike Git, where you version files, Dolt versions tables. This means you can update and change data without worrying about losing the changes.</p><p>While the app is still new, there are plans to make it 100% Git- and MySQL-compatible in the near future.</p><h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight and partially open source.</li><li>SQL interface, making it more accessible for data analysts compared to more obscure options.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3><ul><li>Dolt is still a maturing product in comparison to other database versioning options.</li><li>Dolt is a DB, which means you must migrate your data into Dolt in order to get the benefits.</li><li>Built for versioning tables. That means that it won’t cover other types of data (e.g images, freeform text).</li></ul><h2 id="lakefs">LakeFS</h2><p><a href="https://lakefs.io/">LakeFS</a> lets teams build repeatable, atomic, and versioned data lake operations. It's a newcomer on this scene, but it packs a punch. It provides a Git-like branching and version control model that is meant to work with your data lake, scaling to Petabytes of data.</p><p>Similar to Delta Lake, it provides ACID compliance to your data lake. However, LakeFS supports both AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage as backends, which means it doesn't require using Spark to enjoy all the benefits.</p><h3 id="pros-5">Pros</h3><ul><li>Provides advanced capabilities such as ACID transactions for easy-to-use cloud storage such as S3 and GCS, all while being format agnostic.</li><li>Scales easily, supporting very large data lakes. Capable of providing version control for both development and production environments.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-5">Cons</h3><ul><li>LakeFS is a relatively new product, so features and documentation might change more rapidly compared to other solutions.</li><li>Focused on data versioning, which means you will need to use a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><p>For all the benefits of data versioning, you don’t always need to be investing a huge effort in managing your data. For example, much of data versioning is meant to help track data sets that change a great deal over time.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Where is the love sung by The Black Eye Peas recreated in a tunnel underpass." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emilymorter?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Emily Morter</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Some data, like web traffic, is only appended to.

This is important to note, as in such cases, you might be able to avoid all the setup of the tools referenced above. You will still need to manage the start and end dates to ensure you’re testing on the same data every time, as well as the models you are creating.

<p>Jeff Atwood, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/">The First Rule of Programming: It’s Always Your Fault</a>. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like “Found a bug in React?” paired with an
introductory sentence: “I’m brand new to React.” It’s human to assume there’s a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay’s point is that it’s
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn’t stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying “hey, this is my fault— and I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
— Jeff Atwood</p>

<hr>
<p>Shawn Wang, <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">expert beginner</a> status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: “The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
— Shawn Wang</p>

<hr>
<p>Elisabeth Hendrickson, <a href="https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/">Momentum &gt;
Urgency</a>. I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I’ve worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn’t a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They’ll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
— Elisabeth Hendrickson</p>

<hr>
<p>Scott Hanselman, <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?</a>.
This post isn’t just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I’m making efficient use of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
— Scott Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/">The Iceberg Secret,
Revealed</a>.
Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don’t write software don’t automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What
They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are
going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>. When you’re asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you’ve tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn’t be asking for help right?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Jon Evans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/">Why The New Guy Can’t
Code</a>. The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn’t accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.
— Jon Evans</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Paul Slaughter, <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional comments</a>. I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I’ve
been a part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!
— Paul Slaughter</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, <a href="https://www.nagekar.com/2018/06/advice-from-an-old-programmer-zed-shaw.html">Advice From An Old Programmer</a>. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It’s a question I’m
grappling with. I’m choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.
— Zed Shaw</p>

Business does not. Copying is a zero-sum game and all participating players will compete profits away until they reach a Nash-equilibrium, where a further lowering of price, and thus margins, is unsustainable. Innovation is always new and therefore never formulaic. There are certain guidelines successful businesses seem to use but in the end, you’ll still have to go with your gut and make a judgment call according to your own ethical values.</em></p><p>Arguably, replicating findings is one of the best tools we have in our scientific arsenal in order to test the validity of a conclusion.</p><p>Which is why the psychology community was not amused when the methodological crisis now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">Replication crisis</a> started, where it was discovered that many studies weren’t replicable (Nosek et al., 2015).</p><p>Even some of the most cited and well-known studies such as the study that power posing makes you act bolder (Carney, Cuddy &amp; Yap, 2010).</p><p>Which, incidentally, is why it’s so important to not just reference research (instead of parroting some YouTube influencer or blogger) but to also carefully analyze the literature and its limitations yourself. *1</p><p>This doesn’t guarantee perfection, but it does decrease obvious and preventable mistakes.</p><p>JP Ioannidis pointed out serious problems with published research in ‘’Why most published research findings are false.’’</p><blockquote><p>‘’ Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.’’ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" target="_blank">Ioannidis, 2005</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Methodological issues aside, replication matters.</p><p>Well, that’s all fine and dandy weren’t it for the pesky fact that our field relies on innovation.</p><p>Even if you extract all the knowledge from the brains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom" target="_blank">Kevin Systrom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" target="_blank">Mike Krieger </a>and build Instagram, you’d get the complete opposite result because Instagram already exists.</p><p>Even Kevin and Mike can’t replicate it because the variables have changed.</p><p>The entire environment and current social climate (regarding privacy, advertising, users as the product, and social media addiction) are different, and even if it weren’t, no user is gonna switch to an IG clone when IG already exists.</p><p>There are some guidelines that most successful companies seem to follow, however, you can’t formulate a step-by-step plan for the reasons laid out above.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank">Peter Thiel</a> was one of the first to point out this distinction between companies that go from 0 to 1, innovation, and companies that go from 1 to n (copying), in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>.</p><p>Companies that do copy and thus employ a formula they copied from another company open themselves up to fierce competition.</p><p>As more players participate in this zero-sum game, the fixed pie of users and profits will get competed away because there are too many mouths to feed with finite resources. *2</p><p>If you copy each other with no (or no meaningful) distinctions then price will be the only thing you can compete on, which is exactly what we see in commodity markets.</p><p>Player B will lower prices in order to steal market share from Player A. Player A lowers them still. Player C lowers it below both of them. Player D goes too low and goes bankrupt.</p><p>Over time, price will collapse into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank">Nash-equilibrium</a>.</p><p>A point where no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. Go below the current price point and you go out of business because the unit economics fail. Go above the current price point and you go out of business because there’s no good reason for users to pay more for the exact same product. *3</p><p>Unless one player, usually a new one, sufficiently innovates and thus creates a whole new business model. In effect, changing the game. This is essentially the raison d’etre of a startup, and it’s why <a href="https://steveblank.com/about/">Steve Blank</a> defined a startup as: ‘‘a temporary organization <strong>used to search</strong> for a repeatable and scalable business model.’’</p><p>This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that we go through traditional education by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A system that’s not designed to teach independent thinking but rather to reward obedience and implementing rules.</p><p>If you think that’s my opinion instead of the facts, then watch this to get a better understanding of how our modern education system was formed:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_31181"><div><p>If you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a short trip with you to use mathematics as an analogy.</p><p>In mathematical set theory, there’s something called the axiom of choice&nbsp;(AoC).</p><p>Without making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">AoC</a> too complex, picture this:</p><p>Suppose you have 3 jars: Jar 1, Jar 2, Jar 3.</p><p>Each jar contains a piece of paper with a few whole numbers written on it.</p><p>Jar 1: 4, 8, 45</p><p>Jar 2: 646, 23</p><p>Jar 3: 894, 7, 45649, 54, 76</p><p>Now I can make a new jar: Jar 4, which contains one element from each of the jars.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_34730"><div><p>Okay… in order to do that we need to build some machine where we can put something in and it spits something out (a function).</p><p>Let’s create a function that just ‘’chooses’’ the smallest element in each jar.</p><p>So it picks: 4 from Jar 1, 23 from Jar 2 and 7 from Jar 3.</p><p>So now we can put a piece of paper in Jar 4 with 4, 23, 7 on it.</p><p>We’ve created a choice function ‘’pick the smallest element out of each jar’’ that creates a new set (Jar 4) with the chosen elements.</p><p>Even if we had infinite jars, this function always works.</p><p>Because with natural numbers (whole numbers 1 and up), there’s always ‘a smallest’.</p><p>But what if we have an interval in Jar 2 such as (3,5].</p><p>The symbol ( means 3 is not included.</p><p>This creates a problem because what’s the smallest element we should pick now?</p><p>3.1? Well, what about half that 3.05?</p><p>Well, what about half of that again 3.025?</p><p>No matter how close we get to 3 we can always choose a smaller element so our choice function doesn’t work here.</p><p>When you invoke the AoC you claim that even though we don’t know what the choice function is, you’re going to assume there is one.&nbsp;</p><p>(That there is a way to pick one element out of each jar and create a new jar with those elements.)</p><p>An analogy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a> came up with is that if you have an infinite pair of shoes you can create a choice function: Pick the left shoe from every pair.</p><p>But if you have an infinite pair of identical socks, there’s no such thing as right or left, so you can’t create a choice function to pick one sock from each pair and therefore have to invoke the AoC.</p><p>The AoC is something that can not be proven or disproven, you either invoke it or you don’t.</p><p>If you use it, it allows you to do certain kinds of mathematics but also creates paradoxes such as the Banach-Tarski paradox.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hard to explain without mathematics but a sketchy way to think about it is that it’s possible to break a sphere into pieces, rotated them and you get your sphere back, rotate them differently and you have two spheres with the same volume as the original.</em></p><p>And if you don’t invoke the AoC, there’s certain mathematics you can’t do.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1560851539916_43081"><div><p>Just like not knowing the existence of a choice function and invoking the Axiom of Choice, we often can’t know the best way to proceed in business under the current market and technology circumstances.</p><p>We often can’t prove or disprove our hypotheses, especially when you’re innovating, so reason fails us to some extent.</p><p>We talked about the limitations of reason and the upside of using a more Darwinian approach in the essay series: ‘‘<a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/illogical" target="_blank">Why Your Business Needs More Weird Ideas.</a>’’</p><p>In essence, you’re saying: ‘‘It’s fundamentally impossible to determine what the best way to innovate is, but I’m just gonna assume there is a way.’’</p><p>It’s an enigmatic problem so you just have to take a stance and make a decision according to your ethical values.</p><p>I want to end with an excerpt from the interview with Andrew Mason, the Founder and early CEO of&nbsp;Groupon.</p><p><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/andrew-mason-on-groupon.html" target="_blank">The Quick Rise and Even Faster Fall of Groupon, Through the Eyes of Its CEO.</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>There was one other part of the letter that says your biggest regrets are the moments that you let a lack of data override your intuition of what’s best for the customers. What did you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Groupon started out with these really tight principles about how the site was going to work, really being pro-customer. And as we expanded people in the company would say, “Hey, why don’t we try running two deals a day?” “Why don’t we start sending two emails a day?” And I’d think, <em>That sounds awful. Who wants to get two emails every single day from a company. </em>And they’d be like, <em>Sure, it sounds awful to you. But we’re a data-driven company, so why don’t we let the data decide? Why don’t we do a test?</em> And we’d do a test, and it would show that maybe people would unsubscribe at a slightly higher rate, but the increase in purchasing would more than make up for it. You’d get in a situation where it doesn’t feel right, but it does seem like a rational decision.</p><p>The problem was when you’re in hypergrowth like this, you don’t have time to see what is going to happen to the data in the long term. The churn would catch up with you. People would unsubscribe at higher rates, and then, before you know it, the service has just turned into something — if you look at Groupon now, it’s just this vestige of what it once was. There’s no real copywriting. It’s a marketplace of coupons. It’s still a service that a lot of people get a lot of value out of, but it doesn’t have the spirit it once did.</p><p>There are certain things you have to be religious about in the company. That’s what I’ve taken away from that: There are some things where you have to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going to look at the data on that. This is just what we’re going to do. We know that it’s right, and there’s nothing that’s going to shake us from that.” (Blumberg, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><em>*1 The fact that almost everyone is lazy and assume others have done their homework vs. doing the hard work of checking it themselves is a cognitive error known as </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"><em>diffusion of responsibility</em></a><em>. ‘’The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.’’</em></p><p><em>*2 This is often …</em></p></div></div></div>

          <td colspan="3">
            
            <div id="content">
              <p>I have a couple of different stationary computers. A
                custom-built PC running Windows, an iMac G3 running Mac
                OS 9 and an old HP microtower running Alpine Linux,
                acting as a home server of sorts. Out of all these, I
                spend most of my time on the Windows PC. I use Windows
                for the majority of my work, including a large part of
                the programming that I do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Even though I mainly use Windows, most of my
                web/software development is grounded in or at least
                inspired by Unix in some way: most obviously, I use Git,
                which is a tool designed for the Unix shell. This turns
                out to be a rather awkward match: on the one hand, I use
                Windows Explorer to manage the files; on the other hand,
                I have a command prompt open to manage the repository.</p>
              <p>For my workflow, it would be much better if the Git
                commands were integrated into Explorer itself. So I
                added what amounts to the following code to <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/">my AutoHotKey

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>_frame</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</span>

    <span>/* Next free slot in f_valuestack.  Frame creation sets to f_valuestack.</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_lines</span><span>;</span>         <span>/* Emit per-line trace events? */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_opcodes</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* Emit per-opcode trace events? */</span>

    <span>/* Borrowed reference to a generator, or NULL */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_gen</span><span>;</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>f_lasti</span><span>;</span>                <span>/* Last instruction if called */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_lineno</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* Current line number */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_iblock</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* index in f_blockstack */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_executing</span><span>;</span>           <span>/* whether the frame is still executing */</span>
    <span>PyTryBlock</span> <span>f_blockstack</span><span>[</span><span>CO_MAXBLOCKS</span><span>];</span> <span>/* for try and loop blocks */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_localsplus</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>  <span>/* locals+stack, dynamically sized */</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>

        <span>next_instr</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>

        <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>opcode</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>NOP</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>FAST_DISPATCH</span><span>();</span> <span>// more on this later</span>
            <span>}</span>

            <span>case</span> <span>TARGET</span><span>(</span><span>LOAD_FAST</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// ... code for loading local variable</span>

        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_time#Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American survey,</a> children&nbsp;between the ages of 8-12 and 13-18 spend a daily average of 4 hours, 44 minutes and 7 hours, 22 minutes respectively, staring at screens.</p>
<p>The data for these numbers were collected in 2019. For adults, this figure is higher and according to an article on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post </a>earlier this year, the amount of screen time increased considerably during the quarantine period due to <strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Today, mobile devices take a large percentage of the amount of time people spend staring at screens, this is why there is a need for applications to have a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> option for its users.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> according to <strong>Wikipedia,</strong><em> is a color scheme that uses light-coloured text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design.</em></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the 5 reasons why <strong>Dark Mode</strong> really matters for the end-users of an application!<br>
<a name="reasons-for-dark-mode"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons For Dark Mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg" alt="visual appeal" width="1055" height="703" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"><br>
<a name="visual-attraction"></a></p>
<h3>1). Visual Attraction</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> when applied in the right manner always looks really appealing to the eye. It provides the opportunity to present a unique user interface to the end-users of an application.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of data presentation for graphical contents like dashboards that contain graphs and charts, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> brings out the elegance in the design as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png" alt="Dark Mode" width="1106" height="575" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"></p>
<p>Unlike the drab white look that most applications have, the above image shows how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> can bring a significantly deeper and more attractive visual perception to an application.<br>
<a name="user-experience"></a></p>
<h3>2). User Experience</h3>
<p>Providing the users of a product with the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is a good business decision, especially if the application requires users to spend lots of time on the application. A streaming site, for example, implementing a dark mode feature is a good business decision.</p>
<p>Streaming a video in <strong>light-mode</strong> under a dark environment or at night may not be a good experience for the eyes. Hence, applications that require people spending lots of screen time should provide an option for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for a better user experience.</p>
<p>Above all, it is worthy to note that context is a key factor in making decisions on whether to implement the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong>.<br>

<h3>3). Eye Strain &amp; Blue Light Removal</h3>
<p>By default, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce overall screen brightness. Although no study has outrightly confirmed that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> reduces eye strain, it can, however, be effective in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce exposure to <strong>Blue Light.</strong>&nbsp;Blue light is a high-frequency colour in the “visible light spectrum” that can be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg" alt="blue-light" width="990" height="660" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></p>
<p><strong>Blue Light&nbsp;</strong>can be found almost everywhere, from smartphones to computers and other digital devices. Another source of Blue Light is the sun, so by stepping out of your house, you are exposed to a certain degree of blue light.</p>
<p>Too many exposures to Blue Light can lead to digital eye strain.</p>
<p>Since not everyone can see well with <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters. This can be found in the display settings area and can be easily adjusted to the level of blue light exposure you want.<br>
<a name="reduction-of-photophobia"></a></p>
<h3>4). Reduction of Photophobia</h3>
<p>Photophobia is a symptom of abnormal intolerance to the visual perception of light. The source of this light could be any form of light source including sunlight.</p>
<p>There are so many things that can cause photophobia, some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive light entering the eyes</li>
<li>Eye infection</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Meningitis</li>
<li>Lack of eye pigment (Albinism)</li>
<li>Wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time, or wearing it wrongly.</li>
<li>Post Eye Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Photophobia usually disappears once the underlying cause is treated. A good way to deal with photophobia is making use of the <strong>Dark Mode </strong>of a mobile device or an application. This helps to reduce the amount of bright light that goes directly into the eyes.</p>
<p>An extension you may consider installing on your desktop browser is &nbsp;<a href="https://nighteye.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Eye</a>. It is supported by almost all major web browsers. It helps you enable <strong>Dark Mode </strong>and other features across almost all the websites you view, to help cope with the light sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, if light sensitivity persists, you may want to see your doctor!<br>
<a name="battery-saver"></a></p>
<h3>5). Battery Saver</h3>
<p>Another positive impact of <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is the impact it has on the battery life of mobile devices. <strong>Dark Mode </strong>can significantly help reduce the battery drain on devices which use OLED(Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg" alt="battery-saver" width="952" height="1393" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg 205w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-699x1024.jpg 699w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-768x1125.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></p>
<p>Numerous studies have confirmed the fact that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> saves battery life. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljafaxRcEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Android Dev Summit</a> in November of 2018, Google also confirmed that themes on android devices have a significant impact on the battery life of a mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device, you should consider using <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, especially at night. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it also helps save your battery life.<br>
<a name="factors-to-consider"></a></p>
<h3>Factors To Consider When Selecting Dark Mode</h3>
<p>In as much as <strong>Dark Mode</strong> seems trendy, it is necessary to consider some factors before deciding to implement it in an application. Some of these factors are discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Readability and Visibility:&nbsp;</strong>Readability simply means the ease at which a reader can easily understand or perceive a written text. Applications that contain lots of text in their interface will have to be careful about how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is implemented.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is not well implemented, this will lead to a poor user experience with the users struggling to read the texts. This defeats one of the purposes for which <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is created and could lead to eye strain.</p>
<p>Lots of research must go into how the backgrounds, text colour and font will work together.</p>
<p><strong>Test Before Implementation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Testing helps to discover the strength and weakness of the Color scheme used in an application. <strong>Dark Mode</strong> does not work well for all applications. A website that contains lots of elements(text, images, tables) may make it difficult for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> to be implemented.</p>
<p>Other factors to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the target audience</li>
<li>Providing an option to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode</li>
<li>The Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to always use <strong>Dark Mode </strong>should always be a relative one. For users of an application, knowing when to use light mode and <strong>Dark Mode </strong>at different times of the day is very essential for the eye.</p>

            <p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a very, very long delay, here comes finally another development report about the <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench">BIM tools</a> for <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>. Awfully sorry about the black-out during these last months, lots of things <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_circuit-de-spa-francorchamps-80-millions-d-investissements-et-le-retour-de-la-moto?id=10604892">happened</a> (all the 3D&amp;BIM done with FreeCAD and Blender) and  of course the pandemic didn't ease things either. Anyway, that doesn't mean nothing happened on the FreeCAD front, on the contrary, bugs still get addressed, things get fin-tuned, ideas get discussed, and FreeCAD gets everyday better.</p>
<p>This last month we also had a hectic turnover, because Autodesk changed the terms of the free version of  their <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion360</a>. There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal/hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it's really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to everybody who contributes to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yorikvanhavre">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/yorik/">Liberapay</a> campaigns, I'm really grateful you guys didn't just drop me away when I fail to write for 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, for who didn't notice, FreeCAD now has a proper <a href="https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD/">Liberapay teams account</a> where all money received is divided equally between the FreeCAD developers registered there (currently 7). This account has seen a huge raise of donations these last weeks (it receives around 1000 USD/month at the moment), thanks to the flow of new ex-Fusion360 users, and the impressive job Kunda1 is doing on <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews">the official FreeCAD twitter account</a> (subscribe to it if you are a twitter user, that account used to be just a mirror of the FreeCAD Facebook page, but is now very, very well maintained) and the campaigning of other people (special thanks to my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/beatnikqueen">girlfriend</a>, the most awesome person in the world).</p>
<p>So, no more loitering, to the news! Here is what we got this month:</p>
<h3>Customizable section color</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SetMaterial">Materials</a> now have a new <strong>Section Color</strong> property, which allows to give a different color when the material is viewed and when it is cut through. So for example you can now have your walls appear white when viewed, but black when cut and seen on a TechDraw page.</p>
<p>This is a small improvement so far, but it laid the structure to have more advanced things, such as supporting hatch patterns. The main problem for this, is that, although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/qbrush.html#details">system</a> but it's not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_Module">TechDraw</a>'s implementation of hatch patterns internally recreates OpenCasCade geometry, which works very well but might be heavy for large BIM models. In any case, that's a track I'm <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD/tree/td-makedrawgeomhatch">exploring</a> too.</p>
<h3>Default windows are now openable</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another very small fix, but the default door and windows created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Window">Door and windows tools</a> now have a hinge edge defined, so their <strong>Opening</strong> property now works out-of-the-box. It might not open in the direction you want, though, so you might still need to tweak this. But next items on my list are adding a couple of controls to easily switch opening directions.</p>
<h3>Default pattern size option</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Draft patterns system is now working again (hatch patterns can be added to all closed Draft objects such as rectangles, polylines, circles, etc). I also added a preferences option under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Visual settings</em> to set a default hatch pattern scale, which is useful when you always work with objects of a similar size range, for example building plans. I still have to experiment a bit (0.0025 seems like a very good default setting for BIM), but will add that to the BIM setup screen once I found a couple of good settings.</p>
<h3>Section plane label</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SectionPlane">Section planes</a> now have a <strong>Show Label</strong> property, which, when turned on, show the section plane label on the plane in the 3D view. This is useful to easily identify these section planes when there are many in your document. The text size currently depends on the arrow size, but I'll make all this better customizable later on.</p>
<p>We have further plans too for the section planes, such as be able to double-click or activate them somehow, and find yourself in a separate 2D view with all needed geometry cut or turned off, where you can still work on the model in a 2D environment. This would be a bit like an intermediary step between the full 3D model and a TechDraw view. You can see a first draft of that coded by Carlo Pavan on the experimental tools palette in the BIM workbench.</p>
<h3>TechDraw tools in BIM workbench</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the annotation tools on the BIM workbench, you'll now find two TechDraw tools, <strong>Create page</strong> and <strong>Create view</strong>. The first one is the same of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_PageTemplate">Create page from template</a> TechDraw tool, except that it remembers the last template you used and gets you right there when you use the tool again, so it gives a little bit faster workflow. The second tool is currently the same as the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_ArchView">TechDraw ArchView tool</a> but I plan to make it a bit more flexible in the future so it would become a mix of TechDraw's ArchView and DraftView tools, depending on the selected objects.</p>
<h3>TSV export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Schedule">Schedule</a> tool has been extended to now allow to export results to the .tsv (Tab-Separated Values) format, which is basically the same as the .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format, but using tab characters to separate columns, instead of commas. The big problem of csv, of course, is if there are commas in the columns texts. Usually spreadsheet apps are pretty tolerant with .csv files, they will usually ask you what character to consider as column separator on import, but others (for example GitHub) doesn't display them correctly if they don't use a comma as separator. So from now on there is a correct way to please everybody <i></i></p>
<h3>Blender exporter upgrade</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/yorikvanhavre/029f6fcce9f4d0e62fb6163804b7f80d">FreeCAD exporter for Blender</a> has seen several small fixes, it now automatically adds the .FCStd extension to the generated file if you haven't added it yourself, it now correctly handles object rotation and scaling, and it applies modifiers before exporting. It now also supports faceless objects (wireframe objects).</p>
<p>This coupled with the <a href="https://blenderbim.org/">BlenderBIM</a> improvements, it now becomes increasingly easy to work on BIM models in Blender, or parts of BIM models, and when needed, integrate everything seamlessly in FreeCAD. There are many more joint FreeCAD/Blender developments going on, such as the new <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=51069&amp;p=438881">Sverchok nodes</a> that use FreeCAD internally, literally creating a kind of new interface for FreeCAD withing Blender.</p>
<h3>Detect and suggest development version</h3>
<p>The BIM workbench will now detect your FreeCAD version on the setup screen, and suggest you to install a development version if you are not using one. This will help people to be aware of the existence of development versions, and become more used to them and how to install and mange them.</p>
<h3>Grid extension setting in Working Plane panel</h3>
<p>The overall size of the grid is now settable directly from the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_SelectPlane">Working Plane</a> task panel.</p>
<h3>Multiple custom folders on start page</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Start_Workbench">start page</a> can now show multiple custom folders. To achieve that, go to the start page preferences under menu <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Start</em> and instead of choosing one custom folder, type manually several folder paths, separated by ;;</p>
<p>For example: <code>/home/yorik;;/home/yorik/Examples;;/home/yorik/FreeCAD/Examples</code></p>
<h3>Image Plane scaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_Scale">Draft Scale</a> tool now support image planes created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Module">Image workbench</a>. So it is now easy to import reference images such as scanned floor plans, position them on a common reference point, and scale them to the desired size.</p>
<h3>Unit and Show Unit in Draft dimension preferences</h3>
<p>You can now set default value for these two settings under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Dimensions and Texts</em>, that will affect all newly created dimensions.</p>
<h3>Manual upgrade</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I started upgrading the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual">manual</a> to FreeCAD 0.19, and this time I intend well to produce a printed book with it. To be continued!</p>
<p>That's it for this month I guess, I promise to do everything I can to resume posting once per month!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Yorik</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1978 Japan's <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81">Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry</a>
established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still
serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the
JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the
added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant
or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These
are what came to be known as the ghost characters
(<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97">幽霊文字</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/ghostcanvas.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/ghostcanvas.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>Be careful what you write. <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1312837">via the NDL</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly
forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover
where they had come from.  While all characters in the JIS standard were
supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it
wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.</p>
<p>You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the
characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a "source" - one
of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the "Overview of
National Administrative Districts" (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of
place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind
of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the
<a href="http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html">latest edition</a> is a seven volume set
with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a
single character without a page reference.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was
successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the
catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators
established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the
cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to
record "山 over 女". "山 over 女" occurs in the name of a particular place and
was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't
print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and
pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line
where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to
the character by mistake. The original character
(<a href="https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4">𡚴</a>) was not added to JIS or
Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical
precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a
misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific incident was uncovered.</p>
<p>Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made
their way into Unicode, which has its own <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97">separate set of ghost
characters</a>
introduced during CJK unification.</p>
<p>To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of
nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and
now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the
planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.</p>
<p>At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ</p>

Something they cannot avoid.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is Writer's Block?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Imagine the most delicious food cooked by the best chefs in town. Now imagine yourself sitting down to eat all that food but not being able to.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For various reasons, the writer's block has been the most hated enemy among writers. You sit down to write but nothing comes out. You sit there staring at the blank page for hours, days, or even months. The right words, the right idea, the right passion always evades you. Welcome to writer's block.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to Overcome Writer's Block?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I remember going to the gym, going to the park, and even going to a nearby swamp to watch little frogs jump around. Nothing worked. I came back to my room, picked up the pen, but still the same feeling of doom.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I could not <em>bleed</em> as Hemingway said. My ink had dried. It seemed I would never be able to write. I had forgotten my language.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overcoming writer's block is providential. What may trigger the inspiration in your soul is unknown.

Therapy time.</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Try answering these questions to yourself (or in the comments below):</span></p><ol><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do I criticize myself too much? Do I see faults and imperfections in whatever I write?</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Am I comparing myself to other writers, envying their creativity?</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Am I afraid of criticism?</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do I depend upon compliments and praise from others?&nbsp;</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Am I losing my desire to write? Am I tired, overworked, or demotivated?</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Am I waiting for the perfect story to come flashing down on me like a lightning bolt?</span></li></ol><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do not be demotivated if your answers are yes. No one is perfect. The real question is, what can you do about it? You found the cause, but you still have no remedy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here is a list of a few things I tried. Remember, though, what may trigger your inspiration depends on you.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Make a Routine</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I slept at 4 AM, woke around noon. My lunch was my breakfast. I never set a fixed time for anything, much less writing. And one day, it stopped.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Set a fixed time every day for writing. It will help you find focus. I found the morning to be the best time. If this works for you, you will look forward to the time you spend writing.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Write Imperfectly</span></h2><blockquote><p>There is no such thing as good writing, only good rewriting.</p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">― </span></em>Robert Graves</p></blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I imagine perfection to be a disease. When I am born imperfect, destined to make mistakes, how am I supposed to find perfection in writing? Nowadays, I pick my pen and let it do its work.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stop thinking about perfection. Just let everything flow. It may be a horrible piece, but you did it. Keep writing.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. Do Something Else</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are feeling stuck, demotivated, and finding writing to be a chore. It is time for a change.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monotony is the bane of creativity. Just leave everything, and find something else to do.

    <div>
      <p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/64371281/4082052">stackoverflow Q&amp;A</a> got me thinking about various ways to construct a solution in <code>GNU sed</code> if lookarounds are needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Only single line (with newline as the line separator) processing is presented here. Equivalent lookaround syntax with <code>grep -P</code> or <code>perl</code> is also shown for comparison. Cases where multiple lines and/or ASCII NUL characters are present in the pattern space is left as an exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="filtering">Filtering<a href="#filtering" aria-label="Anchor link for: filtering">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Here, you only need to decide whether the input line has to be matched or not. <code>sed</code> supports grouping commands inside <code>{}</code> that should be executed only if a filtering condition is matched. The condition could be negated by adding a <code>!</code> character. In this way, you can emulate chaining of multiple positive and/or negative lookaround conditions.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ cat items.txt
</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg
a,b,c,d
;foo xyz3

</span><span># filter lines containing a digit character followed by a ; character
# lookaround isn't needed here
# same as: grep '[0-9].*;' or grep -P '\d(?=.*;)'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/[0-9].*;/p'</span><span> items.txt
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg

</span><span># filter lines containing both digit and ; characters in any order
# same as: grep -P '^(?=.*;).*\d'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/;/{ /[0-9]/p }'</span><span> items.txt
apple=</span><span>50 </span><span>;per kg
;foo xyz3

</span><span># filter lines containing both digit and ; characters
# but not if the line also contains character a
# same as: grep -P '^(?!.*a)(?=.*;).*\d'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/a/!{ /;/{ /[0-9]/p } }'</span><span> items.txt
;foo xyz3
</span></code></pre>
<p>For some cases, multiple condition check like the previous examples is not enough. For example, filter a line if it contains <code>par</code> as long as <code>cart</code> isn't present later in the line. Presence of <code>cart</code> earlier in the line shouldn't affect the outcome. In such cases, you can first change the input line to add a newline character wherever <code>cart</code> is present and then construct a condition such that it depends on the newline character instead of <code>cart</code>. If a match is found, delete all the newline characters and then print the line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par carted spare cart park city'

</span><span># same as: grep -P 'par(?!.*cart)'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'s/cart/\n&amp;/g; /par[^\n]*$/{ s/\n//g; p }'</span><span>
par carted spare cart park city
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Newline is a safe character to choose for default line by line processing, as <code>sed</code> removes it from the pattern space. If you are processing a pattern space that contains newline character (for example: <code>-z</code> option, <code>N</code> command, etc), then you can still perform this trick as long as you know a character that is guaranteed to be absent from the input data. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="substitution">Substitution<a href="#substitution" aria-label="Anchor link for: substitution">🔗</a></h2>
<p>In previous section, you saw how to modify input line with newline character to make it easier to construct a lookaround condition. This trick comes in handy for substitution as well. However, for search and replace cases, you also need to emulate zero-width nature of lookarounds. To achieve this, you can make use of <code>t</code> command to construct a loop that performs substitution as long as a match is found. See my chapter on <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnused/control-structures.html">Control structures</a> for more details about branching commands in <code>GNU sed</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of looping. Aim is to delete <code>fin</code> from the given input recursively.</p>
<pre><code><span># manual repetition, assuming count is known
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/fin//'</span><span>
cofing
$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/fin//; s///'</span><span>
cog

</span><span># :loop marks the 's' command with label 'loop'
# tloop will jump to label 'loop' as long as the substitution succeeds
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>'coffining' </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>':loop s/fin//; tloop'</span><span>
cog
</span></code></pre><h3 id="negative-lookarounds">Negative lookarounds<a href="#negative-lookarounds" aria-label="Anchor link for: negative-lookarounds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some cases can be solved by performing substitution only if a condition is first satisfied. Note that <code>{}</code> grouping is optional here.</p>
<pre><code><span># same as: perl -ne 'print if s/^(?!;).*?\K[ ,].*//'
</span><span>$ sed </span><span>-</span><span>n </span><span>'/^;/! s/[ ,].*//p'</span><span> items.txt
</span><span>1</span><span>
apple=</span><span>50</span><span>
a
</span></code></pre>
<p>Change <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> only if it is not followed by a digit character. Note that <code>foo</code> at the end of string also satisfies this assertion. <code>foofoo</code> has two matches as the assertion is zero-width in nature, i.e. it doesn't consume characters. Here, the first step is inserting a newline character between <code>foo</code> and a digit character. Then change all <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> as long as it is at the end of string or if it isn't followed by a newline character. Once the loop ends, remove all the newline characters.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'hey food! foo42 foot5 foofoo'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/foo(?!\d)/[baz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/(foo)([0-9])/\1\n\2/g;
                      :a s/foo([^\n]|$)/[baz]\1/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'</span><span>
hey [baz]d! foo42 [baz]t5 [baz][baz]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Change <code>foo</code> to <code>[baz]</code> only if it is not preceded by <code>_</code> character. <code>foo</code> at the start of string is matched as well.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'foo _foo 42foofoo'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/(?&lt;!_)foo/[baz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/(_)(foo)/\1\n\2/g;
                      :a s/(^|[^\n])foo/\1[baz]/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'
</span><span>[baz] _foo </span><span>42</span><span>[baz][baz]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>par</code> with <code>[xyz]</code> as long as <code>s</code> character is not present later in the input. This assumes that the assertion doesn't conflict with the search pattern, for example <code>s</code> will not conflict with <code>par</code> but would affect if it was <code>r</code> and <code>par</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par spare part party'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/par(?!.*s)/[xyz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>'s/s/&amp;\n/g;
                      :a s/par([^\n]*)$/[xyz]\1/; ta;
                      s/\n//g'</span><span>
par s[xyz]e [xyz]t [xyz]ty
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace all empty fields with <code>NA</code> for csv input (assuming no embedded comma, newline characters, etc).</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>',1,,,two,3,,,'

</span><span># same as: perl -lpe 's/(?&lt;![^,])(?![^,])/NA/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/,,/,NA,/g; ta; s/^,/NA,/; s/,$/,NA/'
</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,two,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA</span><span>,</span><span>NA
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace if <code>go</code> is not there between <code>at</code> and <code>par</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'fox,cat,dog,parrot,dot,park,go,spare'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/at((?!go).)*par/[xyz]/'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>'s/go/\n&amp;/g; s/at[^\n]*par/[xyz]/; s/\n//g'</span><span>
fox,c[xyz]k,go,spare
</span></code></pre><h3 id="positive-lookarounds">Positive lookarounds<a href="#positive-lookarounds" aria-label="Anchor link for: positive-lookarounds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Surround fields with <code>[]</code> except first and last fields for csv input (assuming no embedded comma, newline characters, etc). With positive lookaround emulation, the modified string may continue to satisfy the matching condition, resulting in infinite looping. In this example, the fields themselves may contain <code>[]</code> characters, so you cannot use them to prevent infinite loop. The newline character trick comes in handy again.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'1,t[w]o,[3],f[ou]r,5'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/(?&lt;=,)[^,]+(?=,)/[$&amp;]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/,([^,\n]+),/,\n[\1],/g; ta; s/\n//g'
</span><span>1</span><span>,[t[w]o],[[</span><span>3</span><span>]],[f[ou]r],</span><span>5
</span></code></pre>
<p>Add space at word boundaries, but not at the start or end of string. Also, don't add space if it is already present. Here, negated character class on space character is enough to emulate the assertion.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'total= num1+35*42/num2'

</span><span># same as: perl -lpe 's/(?&lt;=[^ ])\b(?=[^ ])/ /g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/([^ ])\b([^ ])/\1 \2/; ta;'</span><span>
total </span><span>=</span><span> num1 </span><span>+ </span><span>35 </span><span>* </span><span>42 </span><span>/</span><span> num2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>par</code> with <code>[xyz]</code> as long as <code>part</code> occurs as a whole word later in the line. Here, the nature of the modified string itself prevents the possibility of infinite loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'par spare part party'

</span><span># same as: perl -pe 's/par(?=.*\bpart\b)/[xyz]/g'
</span><span>$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> sed </span><span>-</span><span>E </span><span>':a s/par(.*\bpart\b)/[xyz]\1/; ta'
</span><span>[xyz] s[xyz]e part party
</span></code></pre><h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor link for: summary">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Branching commands and some creative preprocessing of the input can be combined to emulate lookaround assertions in <code>sed</code>. Given that <a href="https://catonmat.net/proof-that-sed-is-turing-complete">Unix utility sed is Turing complete</a>, it's perhaps not a big surprise. Now, please excuse me, I'll be busy reaping points on stackoverflow/unix.stackexchange for this edge case ;)</p>

  <p>There’s debugging and there’s <em>debugging</em>.
This is a story of the latter.
Before we get into this jaunt I’d like to add that I’ve written this piece to mimic how we actually got to the conclusion.
If you’re experienced in strange stuff you might see a faster route or use a different tool.
There’s more than one way to do most of this and this was what I had at hand when I needed it.</p>

<h2 id="all-stories-start-somewhere">All stories start somewhere</h2>

<p>Some background first.
I’m currently working in a bioinformatics lab that works on the functional identification of proteins.
One of our projects requires that we benchmark against an older tool that performs a similar function.
I’m not going to throw the particular tool under the bus, but needless to say, it’s charming in a way that only academic software can be.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation ranges from “poor” to “nonexistent.”</li>
  <li>It’s held together with an unholy amalgamation of Perl, awk, tsch, and yes, <strong>Fortran</strong>.</li>
  <li>It includes/distributes binaries to other programs that the internet has <em>forgotten</em>.</li>
  <li>Some of the copyright headers are from when I was in elementary school- others before even that.</li>
</ul>

<p>So… “charming.”
A web-based version is available but is limited to how many proteins you can submit (via cgi-bin!) within a 24 hour window (it’s a low number- say ~100) and we need to process well over 100k.
So the naive, innocent question that started this was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, can we run it locally?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all, all the pieces are available for download so it would seem simple enough, right?
You can probably already surmise the answer since you’re reading an article called “extreme debugging.”</p>

<p>I’m going to focus on a small pieces of a much larger puzzle called <code>netNGlyc</code>.
This handy, dandy little program is used to predict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-linked_glycosylation">N-glycosylation</a> sites in proteins.
It’s distributed as a tarball.
Easy enough!</p>

<p>We can unpack it, and then perform setup by editing its main file <code>netNglyc</code> (written in <code>tsch</code>) by specifying the path to the unpacked dir.
Easy peazy.
And then we run the quick test and…</p>

<p><img src="https://squanderingti.me/img/nGlyc/seg_faults.gif" alt="">
<em>All the segfaults</em></p>

<h2 id="what-process-is-actually-segfaulting">What process is actually segfaulting?</h2>
<p>The entry point into this program is a <code>tsch</code> script that calls numerous additional <code>awk</code> and <code>tsch</code> files.
We have a few options we can try.</p>

<p>If kernel logging is enabled, then <code>dmesg</code> logs might include the offender like the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[30590535.213144] how98_Linux[1560171]: segfault at 8000000 ip 00000000080744f7 sp 00000000ffb8a114 error 4 in how98_Linux[8048000+5a000]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A second option, assuming <code>dmesg</code> doesn’t include this or doesn’t help, is to use <code>strace</code>.
If you don’t have much experience with <code>strace</code> and you work on Linux frequently, it’s very much worth your while to learn this tool.
We’re going to use it with <code>-f</code> for “follow process forking” so we can see everything that ends up being called.
We’re also invoking it with <code>-o</code> so we can write the output to a file and go through it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>strace -f -o /tmp/debugging ./netNglyc test/LEUK_RAT.fsa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then look through the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grep SIGSEGV /tmp/debugging
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looking for <code>SIGSEGV</code> will show us everywhere a segfault signal was handled.
We’ll hopefully see lines like the following, where the left-most integer is the PID of the process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 +++ killed by SIGSEGV (core dumped) +++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can grep for both the PID and the <code>execve</code> syscall<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to see what program was launched.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grep 1560785 /tmp/debugging | grep exec
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lo and behold:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 execve("/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux", ["/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Program"...], [/* 89 vars */]) = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="exploring-the-target">Exploring the target</h2>

<p>We have our culprit.
It’s whatever <code>how98_Linux</code> is.
First question: what exactly is it?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ file how98_Linux
how98_Linux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, stripped
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh.
So the thing crashing is an <em>old</em> statically linked binary that’s been fully stripped<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A quick run of <code>nm</code> will confirm the awful truth and yield the same result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$nm how98_Linux
nm: how98_Linux: no symbols
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s quickly recap what we learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We have a 32-bit ELF binary</li>
  <li>Statically linked with glibc</li>
  <li>Against Linux ABI 2.0.0 (for the record: that’s from 1996)</li>
  <li>And it has no symbol table</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="maybe-recreate-its-input">Maybe recreate its input?</h2>

<p>The question at hand is now: is there something wrong with this ancient program, or is there something wrong with our environment?
After all, it’s been in use for years and years (right??).
Inspecting the binary is going to take some effort, so maybe the best approach is to make sure that the input files are correct.
Previously, we’ve run into problems with other programs like this thanks to subtle differences between shells or between <code>gawk</code> vs <code>awk</code> etc.</p>

<p>From the <code>strace</code> output for <code>exec</code> we can see the program didn’t actually take any arguments.
Right after the name of the program there’re square brackets indicating the arguments.
If I make up an argument like “asdf” and pass it to the program you can see it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$strace -f -eexecve ~/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux asdf

execve("/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Programs/netNglyc-1.0-broken/how/how98_Linux", ["/mnt/home/cchandler/ceph/Program"..., "asdf"], [/* 65 vars */]) = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It would be a fairly logical deduction to say that it must be reading from <code>stdin</code>.
Indeed, the <code>strace</code> output contains a <code>read(0)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560785 read(0,  &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
1560785 &lt;... read resumed&gt; "********************************"..., 4096) = 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Linux, file descriptor 0 is always <code>stdin</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>.
It’s starting to look like we’re not going to get out of digging through all the <code>tsch</code> and <code>awk</code>.
Secondly, that line of stars “*****” is actually a preview of the what the process read, and we can find a matching call above to <code>write</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1560675 write(1, "********************************"..., 4096 &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yup. Here we have the file descriptor 1 which is always <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<p>Everything is being redirected via pipes.
Unfortunately, reconstructing the movement of data through pipes is extremely non-trivial.
<em>Somewhere</em> in the <code>strace</code> output we’re going to find some calls to <code>open()</code> which will reveal the paths to the specific files we’re looking for.
Double unfortunately, if they’re interleaved with <code>chdir</code> calls we might only have relative paths.
There’s also the problem of just a <strong>ton</strong> of data.
A quick run of <code>strace</code> tracking only <code>open()</code> calls yields thousands of results.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>strace -f -eopen -o /tmp/opens ./netNglyc test/LEUK_RAT.fsa
*output omitted*

wc -l /tmp/opens
5489 /tmp/opens
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ugh.
Even if we filter out all the <code>open</code> calls to library files we’re still left with north of 2k results.
An alternate approach might be needed.</p>

<h2 id="a-break--a-very-surprising-twist">A break &amp; a very surprising twist</h2>

<p>Break time.</p>

<p>Time to switch gears and deal with a few other things.
How about making a copy of <code>netNGlyc</code> in my home directory so I can do some more analysis later.
Let’s give it a run to make sure the error is reproducible.</p>

<p><img src="https://squanderingti.me/img/nGlyc/working.gif" alt="">
<em>Excuse me?</em></p>

<p><em>Of course</em> it ran correctly.
No segfaults. No goofy messages.</p>

<p>Somehow, copying the files to my home directory fixes everything.
No permissions were modified in the process.
The only difference between the working copy and broken copy are which filesystem they’re running on<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>.
It’s suddenly starting to appear that this segfault is somehow filesystem related.</p>

<p>But that’s nonsense.
What could it possibly be doing that would interfere with the underlying filesystem?</p>

<h2 id="sleep--the-inputs-at-last">Sleep &amp; the inputs at last</h2>

<p>The next morning.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with locating the errant inputs is that the <code>netNGlyc</code> script cleans up after itself.
It’s doing this via <code>rm -rf</code> on its temp directory.
Commenting that out we now have a <code>tmp</code> directory full of subdirectories.
We can combine our sequence of asterisks from the <code>strace</code> output with <code>grep</code> to finally locate the files in question.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ grep -H '^\*\*\*\*' * | sort | uniq
how.test.dat:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576058:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576071:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576086:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576098:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576110:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576153:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576192:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576235:**************************************************************************
tmp.dat.1576258:**************************************************************************
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The input files are all named something like <code>tmp.dat.123456</code>.
The trailing number in the filename (<code>-H</code> to <code>grep</code>) is likely the PID of the process that originally created it.</p>

<p>Let’s pipe one of these files to our friend <code>how98_Linux</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ../../how/how98_Linux &lt; tmp.dat.1576192
open: can't stat file
apparent state: unit 3 named test.how
lately reading sequential formatted external IO
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fantastic! We finally have a small chunk of iterable work that we can play with.
The copy in my home directory works the same way, except of course that it outputs the correct result.</p>

<h2 id="a-hammer-named-gdb">A hammer named GDB</h2>

<p>Maybe there’s <em>something</em> we can learn from this binary.
Every time in my career that I’ve had to reach for <code>strace</code> and <code>gdb</code> to fix third-party code it has been a tale of woe.</p>

<p>This case is probably no different.</p>

<p>Remember that stripped symbol table?
Normally we could run <code>where</code> inside <code>gdb</code> and it would return all the frames on the stack.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) run &lt; tmp.dat.1576058

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>The last two decades have yielded us some great understandings about Software Development. A big part of that is due to the emergence of DevOps and itâ€™s wide adoption throughout the industry.</p>

<p>Leading software companies follow identical patterns: Fast iterations in software development followed by Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment. Every artefact is tested on its ability to provide value, always has a state of readiness and is deployed through automation.</p>

<p>As a field, Machine Learning differs from traditional software development, but we can still borrow many learnings and adapt them to â€œourâ€� industry. For the last few years, weâ€™ve been doing Machine Learning projects in production, so beyond proof-of-concepts, and our goals where the same is in software development: reproducibility. So we built a pipeline orchestrator, strong automations and established a workflow to achieve exactly that.</p>

<p>Why not just Jupyter Notebooks? Well, how long does it take to construct a Notebook from scratch, with all processing steps, from scratch? And how easy is it to onboard new members to the team? Can you reproduce the results youâ€™ve had two months ago, now, fast? Can you compare todayâ€™s results against historic oneâ€™s? Can you give provenance over your data throughout training? And what happens if your model goes stale?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve faced all of these issues, and more, and now took our experience to deduce 12 factors (as a nod to the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 factor app</a>) that build the backbone of successful ML in production.</p>

<h2 id="1-versioning">1. Versioning</h2>

<p>While obvious to basically all Software Engineers, version control is not an universally accepted methodology among Data Scientists. Let me quote the folks at Gitlab as a quick primer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version control facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. Version control software enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, versioning lets you safely manage the moving parts of Software Development.</p>

<p>As a special form of Software Development, Machine Learning has unique requirements. First, it has not one but two moving parts: Code and Data. Second, model trainings happen in (fast) iterations and introduce a high variance of code (e.g. splitting, preprocessing, models).</p>

<p>As soon as data can be subject to change it needs to be versioned to be able to reproducibly and repeatably conduct experiments and train models. Cruder forms of versioning (read: hard-copies) can go a long way, but especially in team scenarios shared, immutable version control becomes critical.</p>

<p>Version control of code is even more key. In addition to aboveâ€™s quote, preprocessing code is not just relevant at training but also at serving time and needs to be immutably correlatable with models. Serverless functions can provide an easy-access way to achieve a middle ground between the workflow of Data Scientists and production-ready requirements.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> You need to version your code, and you need to version your data.</p>

<h2 id="2-explicit-feature-dependencies">2. Explicit feature dependencies</h2>

<p>In a perfect world, whatever produces your input data will forever produce exactly the same data, at least structurally. But the world is not perfect, youâ€™re consuming data from an upstream service thatâ€™s built by humans and might be subject to change. Features will change, eventually. At best, your models fail outright, but at worst theyâ€™ll just silently start to produce garbage results.</p>

<p>Explicitly defined feature dependencies allow for transparent failure as early as possible. Well-designed systems will accommodate feature dependencies both in continuous training as well as at serving time.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Make your feature dependencies explicit in your code.</p>

<h2 id="3-descriptive-training-and-preprocessing">3. Descriptive training and preprocessing</h2>

<p>Good software is descriptive - it can be read and understood easily without reading every line of code.</p>

<p>And while Machine Learning is a unique flavor of Software Development it doesnâ€™t exempt practitioners from following established coding guidelines. Basic understanding of coding standard essentials can be picked up with very little effort and in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Code for both preprocessing and models should follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>. It should consist of meaningful object names and contain helpful comments. Following PEP8 will improve code legibility, reduce complexity and speed up debugging. Programming paradigms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> provide thought frameworks to make code more maintainable, understandable and flexible for future use cases.</p>

<p>Configuration should be separated from code. Donâ€™t hardcode your split ratios, provide them at runtime through configuration. As known from hyperparameter tuning, a well-separated configuration increases speed of iterations significantly and makes codebases reusable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Write readable code and separate code from configuration.</p>

<h2 id="4-reproducibility-of-trainings">4. Reproducibility of trainings</h2>

<p>If you canâ€™t reproduce training results you canâ€™t trust the results. While this is somewhat the overarching theme of this blogpost, there are nuances to reproducibility. Not just do you need to be able to reproduce a training yourself, the entire team should be able to do so. Obscuring trainings in Jupyter Notebooks on someones PC or on some VM on AWS is the literal inverse of a reproducible training.</p>

<p>By using pipelines to train models entire teams gain both access and transparency over conducted experiments and training runs. Bundled with a reusable codebase and a separation from configuration, everyone can successfully relaunch any training at any point in time.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Use pipelines and automation.</p>

<h2 id="5-testing">5. Testing</h2>

<p>Testing comes in many shapes and forms. To give two examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a> is testing on an atomic level - every function is tested individually on itâ€™s own specific criteria.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration testing</a> is taking an inverse approach - all elements of a codebase are tested as a group, in conjunction and with clones/mocks of up- and downstream services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both paradigms are good starting points for Machine Learning. Preprocessing code is predestined for unit testing - do transforms yield the right results given various inputs? Models are a great use case for integration tests - does your model produce comparable results to evaluation at serving time in a production environment?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Test your code, test your models.</p>

<h2 id="6-drift--continuous-training">6. Drift / Continuous training</h2>

<p>Drift is a legit problem for production scenarios. You need to account for drift as soon as there is even a slight possibility that data might change (e.g. user input, upstream service volatility). Two measures can mitigate risk exposure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data monitoring for production systems. Establish automated reporting mechanisms to alert teams of changing data, even beyond explicitly defined feature dependencies.</li>
  <li>Continuous training on newly incoming data. Well-automated pipelines can be rerun on newly recorded data and offer comparability to historic training results to show performance degradation as well as offer a quick way to promote newly trained models into production, given better model performance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you data can change run a continuous training pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="7-tracking-of-results">7. Tracking of results</h2>

<p>Excel is not a good way to track experiment results. And not just Excel, any decentralized, manual form of tracking will yield non-authoritative and therefore untrustworthy information.</p>

<p>The right approach are automated methods to record training results in a centralized data store. Automation ensures the reliable tracking of every training run, and allows for a later comparability of training runs against each other. Centralized storage of results give transparency across teams and allows for continuous analysis.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Track results via automation.</p>

<h2 id="8-experimentation-vs-production-models">8. Experimentation vs Production models</h2>

<p>Understanding datasets requires effort. Commonly, this understanding is gathered through experimentation, especially when operating in fields with a lot of hidden domain knowledge. Start a Jupyter Notebook, get some/all of the data into a Pandas Dataframe, do some hours of out-of-sequence magic, train a first model, evaluate results - Job done. Well, unfortunately not.</p>

<p>Experiments serve a purpose in the lifecycle of Machine Learning. The results of these Experiments are however not models, but understanding. Models from explorative Jupyter Notebooks are proof for understanding, not production-ready artefacts. Gained understanding will need more molding and fitting into production-ready training pipelines.</p>

<p>All understandings unrelated to domain-specific knowledge can however be automated. Generate statistics on each data version youâ€™re using to skip any one-time, ad-hoc exploratory work you might have had to do in Jupyter Notebooks, and move straight to the first pipelines. The earlier you experiment in pipelines, the earlier you can collaborate on intermediate results and the earlier youâ€™ll receive production-ready models.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Notebooks are not production-ready, so experiment in pipelines early on.</p>

<p>The avoidance of skewed training and serving environments is often reduced to correctly embedding all data preprocessing into the model serving environments. This is absolutely correct, and you need to adhere to this rule. However, it is also a too narrow interpretation of Training-Serving-Skew.</p>

<p>A little detour to ancient DevOps history: In 2006 the CTO of Amazon, Werner Vogels, coined the term â€œYou build it, you run itâ€�. Itâ€™s a descriptive phrase for extending the responsibility of Developers to not only writing but also running the software they build.</p>

<p>A similar dynamic is required for Machine Learning projects - an understanding of both the upstream generation of data and the downstream usage of generated Models is within the responsibility of Data Scientists. What system generates your data for …</p></div></section></div>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

<p>Older versions of WinLIL can be found in these files: <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil13.zip">winlil13.zip</a>
(1.3 binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190524200539.zip">winlil20190524200539.zip</a>
(1.3 source), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20170425.zip">winlil20170424.zip</a>
(binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlilsrc20161220.7z">winlilsrc20161220.7z</a>
(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

Why not a text adventure!"</p><p>Now, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.</p><p>If you have <code>vscode</code>, you can play now with a quick <code>npm install</code> into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)</p><h3>So What?</h3><p>This is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. </p><p>If you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:</p><p>First of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> gameStart = <span>null</span>;</code></pre></div></div></div><p><span>➖</span></p><p><span>➕</span></p></div><p>(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)</p><p>This screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-04-type-only.png"></span></p><p>However, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-01.png"></span></p><p>There is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree. It was very easy to make, but autocomplete ruins the fun by giving all the answers away. </p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-05-easy.png"></span></p><p>In the process of making the game, I discoved that vscode supports jsdoc markdown. So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-03.png"></span></p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips</li><li>Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)</li><li>Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3><ul><li><code>npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure</code></li><li>Create a new <code>play.ts</code> file and add the below code</li><li>Hover over <code>execute</code> to see game output (see screenshots for examples)</li></ul><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> { gameStart } <span>from</span> <span>'@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure'</span>;

<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>
