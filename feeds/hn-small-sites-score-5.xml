<p><strong>KLM is in the throes of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at the start of 2020, numerous measures have already been taken to deal with the current circumstances. Expectations are that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with uncertainty. This means that KLM’s structure and size must be rigorously adjusted even further in the years ahead. Consequently, a total of 4,500 to 5,000 positions in the entire KLM Group (expressed in FTEs) will cease to exist.</strong></p>



<p>In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, KLM gradually began reducing the size of its network in February to operate less than 10% of its original number of <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">flights</a> by the start of April. In the second quarter, only 15% of the original number of flights were operated. In July, 30% of the original flights were operated and load factors are lagging behind. As a result, while the network is again being gradually and carefully expanded, revenues are lagging far behind.</p>

 <!-- end A --> 





<p>Prospects for the airline industry – and KLM in particular – are uncertain. Different countries are now beginning to tighten their more relaxed travel restrictions. This is making customers more cautious when it comes to booking a ticket. In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. The degree and speed of recovery will depend on a number of factors including the development of the virus, economic recovery and customer travel behaviour.</p>



<h2>KLM Adjusting to the New Reality</h2>



<p>Government support in the form of a direct state loan and guaranteed bank credit facilities amounting to a maximum of €3.4 billion will enable KLM to navigate the crisis in the forthcoming period. <a href="https://news.klm.com/klm-adapts-organisation-further-due-to-covid-19-crisis/" target="_blank" aria-label="KLM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KLM</a> is extremely grateful for this support provided by means of the loan. In order to guarantee KLM’s existence in the longer term, the airline must adapt its size to the new reality. KLM therefore finds itself compelled to reduce its workforce down to the number needed for the planned operation in 2021/2022. Of the current total of 33,000 FTEs in the entire KLM Group, the workforce must be reduced by 4,500 to 5,000 FTEs to 28,000 FTEs in the course of 2021.</p>



<p>KLM’s size is already becoming smaller – and will continue to be reduced – based on the current measures, which include the non-renewal of temporary contracts (1,500 FTEs) and the Voluntarily Departure Scheme (2,000 FTEs). Additionally, natural attrition (500 FTEs) through retirement and the like in 2020 and 2021 will also contribute to the reduction needed.</p>



<p>Hence, despite the measures already taken, even fewer people will be needed at KLM in the years ahead. Additionally, for positions on the ground we also need to deal with some mismatch in functional skills and capabilities.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for this reason and taking into account the mismatch, alternative solutions will have to be found for ca. 1,500 positions. This relates to up to 500 ground positions, 300 cabin crew positions and 300 cockpit positions and approximately 400 positions at KLM subsidiaries and Air France-KLM group functions.</p>



<p>Given the high level of uncertainty, KLM keeps open the possibility of further reductions in case the production levels will be revised further down for 2021/2022 than the -20% planned now.</p>

<h3>KLM to Cooperate with Trade unions and Works Council</h3>



<p>KLM’s reorganisation plans tie in with organisation-wide changes at Air France KLM. In the forthcoming period, KLM will be cooperating closely with the trade unions to draft a social plan for each collective labour agreement domain and subsidiary, as well as maintaining close consultation with the Works Council about further defining the reorganisation. This will include a more detailed specification of the conditions set by the Dutch government on issuing the financing package. Expectations are that this will be finished in its entirety in the course of October.“</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A great deal has already been done in recent months with respect to adjusting the size of our company in the face of a new reality. Unfortunately, more measures are needed in the short term to guarantee KLM’s continued existence in the future. For this reason, we are elaborating the reorganisation plan to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, while retaining as many jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying the loans as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em>KLM employees are loyal, professional and hard working. They are always ready to serve our customers, one another, the company and society at large. Recent developments have again served to prove that this is true. It is incredibly difficult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valuable, committed colleagues. Certainly in view of how much we have succeeded in achieving together in recent years. The forthcoming period will be devoted to saying goodbye to colleagues who have to leave with due care and to reconstructing KLM.</em></p></blockquote>

						<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p><em><strong>Architectural unrest about Autodesk and its support for the industry’s design businesses is growing. Discontent has been simmering for a decade or more, and has led to calls for EU action.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2013/11/autodesk.logo2013.jpg" alt="autodesk logo" width="181" height="31"></a>The recent <a href="https://letters-to-autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to Autodesk</a> from 17 named members of a 25-strong group of leading architects (28 July 2020: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/"><em>Design firms demand change at Autodesk</em></a>) has been supported by more firms. They extend the geographical reach of those prepared to publicly criticise the US AEC software vendor over its support for architectural design businesses – many of them heavily reliant upon Autodesk’s Revit design software. An additional 18 practices now stand alongside the original letter’s signatories, bringing the total to 35. A further 10 practices are supportive, but have not gone public. In total, more than 50 firms have therefore backed the group’s grievances.</p>

<p>It is clear that Iain Godwin has tapped into a growing sense of unease, though, to be fair, rumblings of discontent have been heard many times over the past decade or so from a variety of software commentators and end-users. For example:</p>

</ul>
<p>Concerns about some software vendors’ monopolistic positions have also been raised internationally by industry organisations, including the <a href="http://www.fiec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC</a>).</p>
<h3>FIEC position paper</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fiec.eu/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg" alt="FIEC logo" width="300" height="117" srcset="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg 300w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-160x62.jpg 160w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo.jpg 443w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>On 24 February 2020, the FIEC published a position paper on the relationship between users and software companies/ editors/ service providers (<em><a href="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/2020-02-24-FIEC_position_on_software_companies-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a></em>). No vendors are named, but, from the similarity of the claims, Autodesk is clearly one of the software providers that FIEC is sufficiently concerned about to urge the European Commission to review competition and data management regulations. Its paper discusses challenges and makes recommendations under four headings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The dominant position of a few software companies/editors/providers raises major concerns.</strong> – The FIEC urges the European Commission to target competition issues relating to software user contracts</li>
<li><strong>The non-EU origin of these suppliers and their infrastructure is exacerbating the lack of autonomy in software capability in the EU.</strong> – The FIEC says EU software users should be allowed to decide where their data is stored (“EU companies should be able to have their data hosted on EU territory, by EU servers/companies, under EU legislation”), calls for the creation of a secure European Cloud, and says software services “should be required to meet EU standards for interoperability and open access”.</li>
<li><strong>Contracting authorities must remain software-neutral and promote open standards</strong>. – The FIEC calls for enforcement of EU public procurement rules, and urges promotion of open standards for data, protocols and file formats in public procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Rules need to be established for multiple-user-access platforms such as BIM models.</strong> – Similarly, the FIEC urges EU measures aimed at protecting the data owner while ensuring appropriate data access rights for other users.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Autodesk not alone in hosting, US dominance, interoperability issues</h3>
<p>Some of these issues are already familiar. Where project data is hosted has been a concern ever since Software-as-a-Service applications began to be deployed in the 1990s, and as use of construction collaboration platforms expanded in the early 2000s, most leading vendors have responded by creating localised hosting centres to serve different operational regions. Hosting&nbsp; project data in the United States, for example, has been resisted by most clients based in Europe and other parts of the world (eg: the Middle East, southeast Asia, etc; read <em>EE</em> August 2014 post <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2014/08/no-saas-safe-harbor/"><em>No SaaS ‘Safe Harbor’</em></a>).</p>
<p>Concentration of large portions of the construction software industry through merger and acquisition activity has resulted in an increasingly dominant position for US software giants. By gobbling up strong players in Europe, Australasia and elsewhere, Autodesk, Bentley, Oracle and Trimble have assembled strong AEC software portfolios, while some of the more generic US software providers such as Microsoft and IBM have also developed applications, services and relationships that give them an increasingly strong foothold in the AEC space.</p>
<p>And software interoperability has been a perennial issue that <em>EE</em> has covered since it started in 2005 (eg: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2005/09/new_roi_return_/"><em>New ROI: Return on Interoperability</em></a>, September 2005). BuildingSmart (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability) started out as an Autodesk initiative in the mid-1990s, but, over 25 years later, global shifts towards open standards are still proceeding almost glacially slowly, with Autodesk’s leading BIM authoring product “widely ridiculed” for its IFC import/export capabilities.</p>
<h3>Autodesk responds on key themes</h3>

However, a <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up blog post by Amy Bunzsel</a> published today (31 July 2020) addresses the main themes, and on openness and interoperability says: “<strong>We continue to invest in supporting IFC</strong> and based on customer feedback we’ve <strong>recently increased development for new industry requirements, focusing on IFCv4 certification</strong>.”</p>
<p>Bunzsel continues:</p>
<p>“Looking to the future, we believe that ways of working will evolve, from the direct modeling of today to outcome-based design driven by analysis…, to the convergence of manufacturing and construction, and that <strong>data needs to be unlocked from native formats and flow more readily throughout Autodesk and non-Autodesk products</strong>.”</p>
<h3>No more software silos</h3>

<p>The current method of sharing information as files of entire 3D models can hinder collaboration. Tracking changes can also be problematic and inefficient for design communication. AEC Delta Mobility breaks down the file barriers to enable small design changes, known as ‘Deltas’, to be shared faster, more openly and more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the software industry should be working with the construction industry.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>I do hear sometimes from programmers who are kind of sad that they don't have the opportunity to write game engines from scratch like I did and have it matter or make an impact...</p> <p>-John Carmack</p></blockquote> <p>I was definitely a programmer who felt like I'd missed a golden era of opportunity. I didn't <em>really</em> start programming until my 30s. Just like many devs hoping to have an impact on the industry, it's sometimes felt like the golden era has already passed.</p> <p>Surveying the market from a more entreprenurial mindset and looking for a potential niche to fill with a SaaS app (or worse, a social network), the situation appears even more dire! News aggregators have been done and Reddit is thoroughly dominant. The professional social network is done and LinkedIn owns it. Market after market is done. <a href="https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done">Everything in tech is done.</a></p> <h2 id="technology-doesn-t-stay-technology"><a href="#technology-doesn-t-stay-technology">#</a> Technology doesn't stay technology</h2> <p>Part of the problem is the word "tech". There are two different—but overlapping—ideas that are both commonly referred to as "tech".</p> <p>By its literal definition, techonology is anything that involves <em>applying scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em>. In a literal sense, we're surrounded by tech. Some, such as the spoon are ancient and others, like the Kinesis keyboard I'm typing on are much newer.</p> <p>But people don't talk about ancient inventions like the fire bow, or Clovis points as "technology", outside of a historical context. Most people don't even call somewhat modern inventions like light bulbs, refrigerators or microwaves as technology either. When we call something technology, we generally mean something invented recently... <em>or</em> we mean something related to computers.</p> <p>Douglas Adams summed it up into three rules:</p> <ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li> <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li> <li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol> <p>Having a musician turned firmware hacker and then programmer for an uncle, I'm a bit more optimistic about aging and see the boundary as more about whether a given technology has been widespread for a decade or not.</p> <p>Cassette tapes and microwave ovens used to be fantastic new technologies in the late 60s and early 70s. Now they aren't. DVDs, the web and 3D video games used to be amazing technologies in the 90s. Now they're taken for granted. Smart phones were incredible in the late aughts. Now they're just phones.</p> <h2 id="when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing"><a href="#when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing">#</a> When pundits say "tech" they generally mean computing</h2> <p>The rapid advances in personal computing during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s was nothing short of breathtaking. Computers were gaining new powers every year or two and PCs were deprecating nearly 50% per year! The web took the boom to an exponentially growing number of users. [<a href="#1">1</a>]</p> <p>It's entirely natural that computer software dominated the discussion of technology for a generation. First journalists, and now many of us are referring to everything from web SaaS apps to mobile productivity apps as "tech".[<a href="#2">2</a>] Since the wider meaning of tech hasn't been abandoned, this makes it very easy to conflate the two.</p> <p>But not all technology is computing and not all computing is technology anymore.</p> <h2 id="where-is-the-edge"><a href="#where-is-the-edge">#</a> Where is the edge?</h2> <p>To an ambitious engineer looking for a market opportunity in "tech", things look crowded. Advances in programming languages, frameworks, open source collaboration, dev ops, visual site-building tools and more have made it <em>dramatically</em> easier to create both web apps and mobile apps than it was a decade ago. This has lead to a flood of competition and an increased importance of marketing and other skills an engineer might not have.</p> <p>But web apps aren't (necessarily) tech. They're "tech".</p> <p>But not all is lost for the aspiring engineer.</p> <p>There are newer technologies, closer to the frontier that aren't common in in 2020 but will be in 2030. Some of them are still wide open to people with more learning power than earning power. Bio-tech, blockchain, and VR <em>are</em> tech and the technical challenges to be solved are real. It's a lot harder to ship a product in those areas than to build yet another SaaS targeting small to medium sized businesses. But that's a <em>good</em> thing if technical skills are your strength.</p> <p>For those whose strengths lean more to the marketing, sales or design sides, the B2B SaaS may represent a better goal. This is good for everyone. There's vast landscape for different people with different comparative advantages to find their niches.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-too-late"><a href="#you-are-not-too-late">#</a> You are not too late</h2> <blockquote><p>...here's where some perspective really helps - I can remember when I was a teenager, I thought I had missed the Golden Age of 8-bit Apple 2 gaming, that I was never going to be Richard Garriott...time went by, and I got to make my own marks in things after that. And, in that time, I also see so many opportunities that have come by.</p> <p>The 90s PC wave was great - I was happy to be there, and I'm glad I took a swing and knocked one out of the park with that. But since then, we've seen mobile games, and web games, and free-to-play games, the Steam revolution...and now virtual reality. And all of these are amazing!</p> <p>So, yeah, the opportunities that I had aren't there for people today - but there are new and better ones. And personally, I'm more excited about these than anything that's come before. So, thank you very much for this honor, but I'm just getting started.</p> <p>-John Carmack (BAFTA acceptance speech)</p></blockquote> <p>The speech John Carmack gave when accepting his BAFTA fellowship filled me more professional optimism than I've felt in quite a while. Even he felt like it was "too late" because of missing all the opportunities of the 80s.</p> <p>In retrospect, that seems crazy. The web was huge and just around the corner.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">#</a> Notes</h3> <p><a name="1">[1]</a> Well more of an S-curve, but it looked exponential then.</p> <div><p><a name="2">[2]</a> As one commenter on HN </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a><p>, it's a spectrum. In Uber's early days, its technology was crucial to its business. Over time, they'll gradually become less of a tech company if they coast and stop innovating.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently went through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> program and <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">loved it</a>.</p>
<p>But the one sour note was that we only got $1,000 AWS credits when <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">the copy seemed to promise $5,000</a>. Our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-chose-a-marketing-and-app-monorepo">entire application infrastructure is on AWS</a> so those credits are pretty much straight-up cash to us. We don't have much of a digital footprint either, so $5,000 goes a long way.</p>
<p>That's why this weekend was such a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3>
<p>Here's how the timeline went.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

                                <div><div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor, known for its upscale fashions and&nbsp;extravagant holiday window displays, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors after a turnaround effort faltered amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>

The oldest U.S. department store&nbsp;filed&nbsp;for Chapter 11 protection in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday and will submit a reorganization plan with the court. The company, founded in Manhattan by two English immigrants in 1826, said it had about US$137.9 million&nbsp;of debt obligations.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s owner, fashion&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;Le Tote Inc., filed for Chapter 11 along with the retail chain. Le Tote bought the rights to the companyâ€™s stores, brand and e-commerce site from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. for US$71 million last year.</p><p>

The company, with 38 stores and 651 employees as of the filing, joins a burgeoning list of department-store casualties tied to the virus, which turned malls into ghost towns. Former fashion stalwarts like J. Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus Inc. already filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor closed all of its stores temporarily in March as governors ordered residents to shelter in place to combat the spreading virus. In court filings, company officials said they are slowly starting to reopen some stores and have recalled 400 employees.</p><p>

San Francisco-based Le Tote offers fashion-apparel rentals. Executives at the company have planned to cut the number of Lord &amp; Taylor stores and target younger women with luxury try-on studios, beauty subscriptions and rental drop-off points.</p><p>

Under the deal with Hudsonâ€™s Bay, the seller agreed to cover Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s rent for three years, saving Le Tote $58 million annually. Le Tote said in a court&nbsp;filing&nbsp;Sunday that its companies reported revenue of about US$253.5 million in 2019.</p></div>

<p>The economic body blows wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Le Tote into putting Lord &amp; Taylor into Chapter 11, Ed Kremer, the companyâ€™s chief restructuring officer, said Monday in court filings.</p>

<p>Le Tote officials were grappling with â€œcarrying the increased expenses associated with the acquisition, as well as the brick-and-mortar assets which were unusable for a substantial period of time,â€� Kremer said in the filings. â€œThese unprecedented market developments, compounded by lower-than-expected financial results, adversely impacted liquidityâ€� and left the retailer drowning in debt, he added.</p>

<p>Le Total officials cut a deal with lenders to allow them access to cash to fund an effort to sell the company and â€œmaximize value for all stakeholders,â€� Kremer added.</p>

<p>The case is Le Tote Inc.,&nbsp;20-33332, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9733"><div><div><div><h2>Google acquired North which made smart glasses similar to Google Glass on June 30, North decides to kill its flagship Focals smart glasses on July 31st</h2><p>Last week we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/amazon-allegedly-stealing-tech-from-startups-under-the-pretext-of-funding-them/">reported how Amazon</a> had been accused of using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon allegedly invested in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. Amazon used such confidential information to launch its own services. Google has far worse compared to Amazon.</p><p>On 30th June, Google announced acquiring North, a smart glass maker. Google reportedly paid upwards of $150 million to acquire the Canadian 8-year-old startup, North which started off as Thalmic Labs. North was manufacturing smart glasses called Focals smart glass. At the time of Google’s acquisition, It had started shipping the Focals 1.0 and in the process of developing next-gen, Focals 2.0.</p><p>It seemed natural that Google would be interested in North as its product line was similar to Google Glass. “We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google had said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/google-acquires-north-augmented-reality-glasses-start-up.html">statement that time</a>. “North’s technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.”</p><p>Exactly one month after Google’s acquisition, North has killed off its flagship product.&nbsp;In a statement on the <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">North website</a>, it says that Focals smart glasses will not be sold any longer beginning July 31.&nbsp;“Focals smart glasses and its services are being discontinued and will no longer be available after July 31st, 2020. You won’t be able to connect your glasses through the app or use any features, abilities, or experiments from your glasses,” the statement reads.</p><p>Not only is North killing its flagship Focals 1.0 smart glasses, but it is also stopping work on the upcoming Focals 2.0 completely.&nbsp;The website says that customers who ordered the Focals 1.0 smart glasses after June 30 are provided with a refund.</p><h2>Google’s predatory instincts</h2><p>Google refused to comment on North killing off its Focals 1.0 and 2.0. North (now under Google) also did not give any reason for abandoning its flagship product.</p><p>North hasn’t provided any information on the reasons for abandoning the product. <strong>However, the company had mentioned that Focals 1.0 would be dropped after Google acquires it</strong>. “We’re proud to have grown our company in the Kitchener-Waterloo region and are thankful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the community. We are looking forward to remaining in the region with Google. We are winding down Focals 1.0 and we will not be shipping Focals 2.0, but we hope you will continue the journey with us as we start this next chapter,” North’s co-founders had said when announcing the Google takeover.</p><p>Many will argue that the North got a fresh lease of life, better funding and research facilities from Google but the question is whether Google was ethical in killing off a rival smart glass?</p> <br></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, some historical background to provide some context. (Meta: There is a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I’ve been an independent/freelance software developer/engineer/consultant/whatchamacallit for 10+ years. All thoughout, I recorded my business activities in an accounting software package (an ancient version of Quickbooks). I did a couple of units in accounting in my undergraduate years so I understood the fundamentals of accounting (assets/liabilities/equity/debit/credit etc.) and the value of having proper financial records. It was easy to do and made sense to me.</p>

<p>In addition to providing software services and consulting to clients, I also dabbled in creating my own startups. Some had moderate success. Some bombed out completely. Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to do ‘bootstrapped’ businesses for quite a while (though maybe it wasn’t known by that term back then).</p>

<p>Then, about 5-6 years ago, an old client of mine asked me to join his new startup. He was very persuasive. So I did.</p>

<p>However, since I was in Australia and the startup company was in California, it was just easier to have a client/consultant relationship than to be an employee. Legally employing me would mean the company would have to incorporate a subsidiary in Australia and all the ensuing hassle that involved.</p>

<p>Nah, too much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained, technically and legally, a consultant/contractor although, for those five years, I worked exclusively for the startup and no one else. But since I was an independent contractor, I had to keep my own books.</p>

<p>And so, I continued to use my accounting software package (which I’m now going to abbreviate to <strong>ASP</strong>) to record the business activities that I did for my ‘boss’. Which was just as well because I still have some recurring revenue from an old SaaS of mine. Those need to be booked as well.</p>

<p>All through the last 10+ years, the ASP been served me well. It’s not perfect, but it was good enough. Quite good for the $80 (ish? It was on special, I think) that I paid for it at the time. However, it was getting quite dated and the license would eventually expire. (I actually have it running in a non-Internet-accessible Windows XP virtual machine. That’s how old it is.)</p>

<p>One day, I was going to have to replace it, or otherwise do something about it, but not yet.</p>

<p>Then, in 2020, the coronavirus/covid-19 pandemic happened. The company I was working for lost funding and folded.</p>

<p>Well …</p>

<p>That was enjoyable: Having a regular a job for 5+ years. And I was getting used to it. What now?</p>

<p>Five years for a tech startup is … tiring (I didn’t expect it to last as long as it did). I didn’t want to rush into looking for another job straightaway. I wanted to take some time off.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks catching-up/reading-up/revising the startup literature. Inevitably, I got drawn back into the ‘bootstrapped business’ game again.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>As the wisdom goes, the way to come up with startup ideas is to ‘notice’ a problem that you have (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the couple of weeks, I tried to ‘go zen’ and notice things. In particular, I tried to notice things which are problems but which my mind would normally just dismiss as ‘that’s just how things are’.</p>

<p>It was a fun time and a challenging exercise to temporarily rewire my brain to look at the world differently. I noticed some things. I brainstormed some ideas. Some were wacky. Most were terrible.</p>

<p>And then I noticed my ancient accounting software package. It’s a problem that’s existed for many years but had always been pushed back as ‘Not now’.</p>

<p>I was surprised. Very. This problem had been dormant for many years. I had just never noticed it before.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more. The software is fine but it needs replacing. Could I create a replacement? How much work would it be? Would anyone else want it? Would they pay for it? I’ve been using it for 10+ years but I only use a small fraction (5%?) of its functionality. Could I improve it by omitting the other 95%? Lots and lots of questions.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do some research around the Internet and I noticed the following: All the major accounting software vendors have gone online/SaaS. SaaS is great for the vendor but, in the case of accounting, it’s terrible for the user. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Business-critical accounting data is stored in the cloud where it’s all controlled by the vendor.</strong> Essentially, the major vendors are forcing small businesses to give up control and then holding the data hostage in return for ongoing SaaS subscription fees. (And it looks like the vendors are getting away with it.)</p>

<p>No way was I, as a user, gonna go with that.</p>

<p>If I was inclined to purchase a replacement for my ASP, I would have trouble finding a suitable one that wasn’t SaaS. I don’t want my business-critical data to be in the cloud. I want it to be in a file on my computer. Furthermore, I don’t want to pay $10-$20 every month to do what, 10 years ago, an $80 product could do for another 10+ years. Think about it: $10-$20 per month vs a $80 one-off fee. It’s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>

<p>So, here, I think, there is a gap in the market. Small and micro-businesses which would otherwise purchase an entry-level ASP are not being well served by the SaaS offerings which are available. (I’m not talking about large businesses which spend much more on accounting software, irrespective of whether it’s SaaS or not. Those are fine.)</p>

<p>So … do I want to go after this market segment?</p>

<p>I’d like to … but I’m not.</p>

<p>Um, why not?</p>

<p>Because I’m just one person. I don’t have the resources/time/funding to go for that.</p>

<p>And anyway, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14046313-start-small-stay-small-a-developer-s-guide-to-launching-a-startup">respected</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book/StartSmallStaySmall">sources</a> recommend starting out as niche as possible (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of targeting the entire market segment, I’m going to go for a niche.</p>

<p>What’s the niche? Well, basically, the niche is … ‘me’ :)</p>

<p>Or rather, the niche would be the characteristics which describe me as a user. So it’d be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator. No employees. No stock. Not a corporation.</li>
  <li>Manage own accounting data. Don’t need an accountant.</li>
  <li>Control over own data. Non-SaaS.</li>
  <li>… and maybe some other stuff that hasn’t manifested yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having used my ASP for 10+ years, I know exactly the feature set that I use. I don’t think I’m anyone special so there should be other people in a situation like mine. In theory, my feature set should be a good match for them too.</p>

<p>So I’ve found, or rather, noticed, a problem and a niche. And the way I’ve defined it, it’s small enough that I can aim a “bootstrapped startup” at it.</p>

<p>Do I wanna go for it?</p>

<p>Yeah, let’s give this a shot and see how things turn out.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-conclusion">TL;DR (conclusion)</h2>

<p>This is why I started GigoBooks: I have an itch to scratch. The itch has been around for <em>several years</em> before I eventually noticed it. It points me to (I think) a market niche which is underserved. I’m going to scratch my itch, and also, create something to serve the niche better. The ‘something’ is a more suitable, more affordable, non-SaaS accounting software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of this year I decided I'd had enough.</p>
<p>I've been writing software and making games since my early teens and for most of my life I've worked on side projects. Some of them made a little money. Others grew a large following. Quite a few failed miserably.</p>
<p>My last project was an open source game development library called <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong></a>. Relative to my previous projects, this project felt very successful. Many hundreds of people starred it on Github. Loads of people joined the Discord chat and it even has it's own tag on Stack Overflow. To this day, people are still using it to make their games.</p>
<p>I always assumed that one day I'd be able to turn it into some side income and maybe eventually replace my full-time job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I always felt like something wasn't quite working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried my very best to help indie game developers make their games. In the beginning the project really resonated with people. Lots of contributors joined to add new features and a community formed around it quite quickly. This felt amazing.</p>
<p>However, this little side project took 5 years of my life. It's the longest amount of time I'd ever spent on anything outside my marriage and kids.</p>
<p>And what did I have to show for it? A bit of pocket money and a whole lot of support requests. As the project got bigger, it put more strain on my limited free time. Eventually it broke me.</p>
<p>Compare that to a game I'd previously published that only took 3 weeks to create and made roughly the same amount of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Then around Christmas I was talking to my dad about his recent retirement. This conversation got me thinking a lot about what I want to do with the next 10 to 20 years of my life. Where do I want to be when I retire?</p>
<p>That's when I decided it was time to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-i-learned-about-failure">The Lesson I Learned about Failure</h2>
<p>After taking some time to reflect on all of my previous projects I realized that failure comes in many forms and some are better than others.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with failure. Not every project works out the way you want and that's okay.</p>
<p>For example, some of my previous projects didn't have <em>market fit</em>. When I launched them into the world, nobody really cared. Luckily when this happens early in the project it's not a big deal. Either discard the idea and move on or figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Another project I started didn't have <em>founder fit</em>. In other words, I initially got excited about the idea and it looked great on paper but over time I really didn't want to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>But the worst kind of failure I've experienced is <em>failure disguised as success</em>. The mistake I made was not recognizing failure early enough. Surprisingly, this was an easy trap to fall into because when it looks like things are working, it feels like just a little more effort will bring everything together.</p>
<p>Unforutnately, more effort applied in the wrong place makes it worse. When the project was small it was easy to manage and I enjoyed working on it everyday. At the time it seemed like a good idea to keep adding more features and watch as more people started using it. But the downside of adding more features is that it becomes increasingly time intensive to fix bugs, update demos, deal with pull requests and respond to questions.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't doing it all for free. I knew at some point I needed to start generating income to be able to dedicate more time to the project. So I launched a Patreon page and immediately had a few people support me finanically. This positive feedback fueled my desire to keep going. Only now, I had another job, creating content to reward my patrons.</p>
<p>I never figured out how to make it work and it was suprisingly difficult to let go.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-was-the-best-thing-i-ever-did">Quitting Was the Best Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>Eventually I decided to stop working on <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and handed the project over to someone else.</p>
<p>At first, this was a really hard decision. It felt like I was throwing away thousands of hours of work and letting down the community around it. But really, it was just a bad case of <strong>sunk cost fallacy.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now firmly believe this was the right choice. The project is still alive and being actively worked on by long time contibutors that use it. Having a new set of eyes on the code base has breathed new life into it.</p>
<p>What I got out of it was a wealth of experience, a chance to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-going-to-do-next">So, What Am I Going To Do Next?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered a whole new world of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">indie hackers</a> creating profitable side projects in their spare time. It's an amazing feeling to find a community of like minded people doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've finally found my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, before I started spending all my time on MonoGame.Extended I built and launched several products. Sometimes they where games and other times it was an app or tool to solve my own problems.</p>
<p>My goal is to get back to my roots. Only this time I've got more experience under my belt. I've learned a lot about building an audience, finding a market, and launching great products.</p>
<p>There's still a mountain of work ahead but I'm excited to be starting the next phase of my journey.</p>
<p>Succeed or fail I'll be writing about it here. If you'd like to see what happens next I'd love to have you on the mailing list below.</p>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I was still a kid, I was always so excited to sit in the front passenger seat on holiday trips. You see, there were no navigation devices yet, and thus we had a physical roadmap. My dad frequently knew the route from memory, but I was eager to follow along on the map (and point out when we could find a quicker or alternative route).</p><p>My excitement for maps has not gone away. It's not coincidental that I'm currently writing about roadmaps in another, similar, sense—product roadmaps.</p><p>In general, the power of a map is to help you get to a destination. But how we create and use product roadmaps is essential. <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-you-should-look-at-everything-as-a-process">It is a process</a> that is both creative and analytical.</p><p>In this series, I aim to guide you through everything you need to know about creating the ultimate product roadmap. In this first installment, I aim to explain what a product roadmap is and why it's such a great tool.</p><h2>What is the purpose of a product roadmap?</h2><p>Let me first tell you what I feel is a good definition of a Product Roadmap, which will help us frame the rest of the points in this guide.</p><blockquote><em>"A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering." - </em><a href="https://www.productplan.com/"><em>ProductPlan</em></a></blockquote><p>We're going to break down the definition step by step, so we understand what it entails.</p><h3><strong>"high-level"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means we don't go into the details of a product vision too much (that's what backlogs are for). We need the roadmap to stay on a strategic level where we can use it to set the course over the long term. To illustrate: think about a ship sailing to some destination. A captain on the vessel needs to look out over the horizon for direction. In contrast, an engineer on the same boat takes care of the machines in the engine room: both necessary for the end goal, but very different levels of focus.</p><h3><strong>"visual"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the product roadmap, like a land roadmap, can be understood without needing to read it (apart from titles, notes, names, etc.). Visual representation helps make the roadmap easier and quicker to understand, which is necessary to get buy-in from everyone involved.</p><h3><strong>"summary"</strong>‍</h3><p>This is similar in the "high-level" part we saw earlier. (Not focus on all the details.) But it does drive home the point that the roadmap should simplify, but definitely not leave out critical parts of the vision. Doing this is hard, especially when a product is big. Note, summarizing is a continuous process.</p><h3><strong>"vision"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the "why" of a product. Why create the product in the first place? What goal does it have? What is the value proposition for users? What is the incentive for the business to create this product? Tip, don't spend a lot of time creating a product roadmap before your vision is crystal clear.</p><h3><strong>"direction"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the execution part of getting to a finished product. It is "how" you go from nothing to providing the value intended. Do I need to say this is important? Well, yes, it is; it is essential. In the execution plan, you find most detail (and struggles) while creating and updating the product roadmap. After you formed a product vision (<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-product-market-fit-is-not-enough">hopefully in line with your customers and your company!</a>), most stakeholders don't sway from that idea. The route to that goal, however, is a bumpy and complicated road. (I'm almost getting ahead of myself in wanting to talk more about this here, but there will be multiple sections where we'll get into the details of this!)</p><h3><strong>"product offering"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means "what" you'll eventually end up creating—the finished product. The whole reason you create a product roadmap is to offer a valuable product to the end-user, your customer.</p><p><em>An interesting aside. Maybe you're already familiar with the last three parts from the definition (vision, direction, and product offering) but under different wording. </em><a href="https://simonsinek.com/"><em>Simon Sinek</em></a><em> talks about the "why, how, and what" (vision, direction, and product offering, respectively). He calls it the "Golden Circle" by his book with the same name.</em></p><h2>What does a product roadmap look like?</h2><p>A product roadmap can take many forms, feature-based, goal-based, time based, release-based, and a few more. But good roadmaps have a few things in common.</p><ul role="list"><li>They are timed based (be it specific dates or timelines).</li><li>They have more detail for near term (higher priority) items than for later (lower priority) items.</li><li>They have 'themes' as the highest level (like "increase customer retention for yearly subscribers"), not features.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's an example of a roadmap (</strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"><strong>source</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><figure id="w-node-47cfe779986d-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5f233514485d617b4cac9b6e_homepage-slider-1-1.png" alt="Roadmap example from roadmunk"></p></figure><p>In the next article, I will walk you through the details of an example product roadmap. As well as listing the different types of product roadmaps that are possible to make. First I'll tell you a bit more about how you can use your roadmap.</p><h2>How can you use a product roadmap?</h2><p>Ok, so now you know what a product roadmap is supposed to do and what it looks like. Right? Well, on a high level, yes. But the utilization of a product roadmap becomes even more evident in the specific cases you use it.</p><p>These are all about people, social dynamics, collaboration, and communication. You can use a product roadmap</p><ol role="list"><li>as a reference document for the (Scrum )team.</li><li>to get stakeholder alignment.</li><li>to provide options for planning and conversation.</li><li>to prevent someone from 'hijacking' your sprints.</li><li>to tell a story to your customers.</li></ol><p>These five uses all come down to the most important reason for creating a product roadmap. To set the narrative of your product vision and execution.</p><blockquote><em>A Product Roadmap is a narrative tool.</em></blockquote><p>With a product roadmap you can tell a story of intent. The intent to build a product towards a certain goal. This narrative is essential to get others to work with you in creating great products.</p><p><em>There is one crucial point I want to drive home. A product roadmap is a living document. The things you plan are not set in stone. The product you're building is undergoing iteration upon iteration. Thus your roadmap should reflect the latest findings and details, especially in the age of Agile and Lean (software) development.</em></p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully, you're now familiar with the idea of what a product roadmap is, why you should use one, and what it looks like.</p><p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or feel something is missing, please do shoot me a message on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/askjibran">Twitter</a>.</p><p>By the way, I also created a checklist with "<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist">40 Product Roadmap tips</a>." So if you can't wait to get into creating and using a product roadmap, I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I launched Feature Upvote, my B2B SaaS, in 2017, the price was $29/month, with a 20% discount for paying yearly. I chose that price  arbitrarily, but also because it is what I felt I would pay for a similar service.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/">hearing repeatedly that developers who start businesses need to charge more</a>, I wanted to experiment with a small increase.</p>
<p>I delayed doing this until I had enough new customers each month to really be sure of the price change’s effect.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I put the price up to $35/month, a 20% increase.</p>
<p>Why such a small increase? I knew in theory that I should charge significantly more, but in practice I wasn’t confident about it. I am, after all, still a developer <img src="https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate stayed roughly the same. That is, the same number of new customers per month, but each paying more.</p>
<p>Nobody complained. Ever. Not a single person questioned the change in our pricing.</p>
<p>A year later, in January 2020 I got bolder. I put the price up to $49/month, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate initially dropped a little but not much. It might have just been statistical noise, or the post-Christmas lull.</p>
<p>I was  getting fewer new customers, but they were paying more. Pricing experts say that customers who pay more tend to remain customers longer, resulting in a much higher customer life time value, so this seemed okay.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic started and we were all in shock and sales stalled for a little while. So it was really hard to tell the true effect of the price increase.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, I’m signing up more new customers than ever, at the conversion rate we had before the price increase.</p>
<p>As with the first price change, nobody complained. Ever.</p>
<h2>What about existing customers?</h2>
<p>I’ve never put up prices for existing customers. I’m okay with people getting the price they started with indefinitely. It is the way I’d want to be treated as a customer. Anyway, within a couple of years, as existing customers churn, the “problem” of older customers paying less will simply go away.</p>
<h2>Has the customer base changed?</h2>
<p>Yes. As the price goes up we tend to get larger organisations as customers. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to ask for custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits. In all cases, I say no. That may change in the future.</p>
<h2>What did I tell existing customers about the price change?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I probably should have, but it fell off my to-do list.</p>
<p>To make sure existing trial customers weren’t shown one price and charged another, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>December 2019: change the prices listed on our pricing page, but still charge new customers the old pricing.</li>
<li>January 2020: start actually charging the new prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other pricing plans</h2>
<p>I have bootstrapper pricing at $19/month (with a 20% discount when paying yearly). I’ve had this pricing since the very start, and never changed it. It is an easy way to answer would-be customers who write “I want to use Feature Upvote, but it is too expensive for me.”</p>
<p>For charities or non-profits who ask, we have a plan that’s 25% cheaper. Almost no-one asks for this plan. I don’t know why, because it is featured on our pricing page.</p>
<p>Just about any Open Source project that asks can use us for free. There are a couple of stipulations, but I tend not to check too carefully.</p>
<h2>Do I charge enough?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m content with the pricing now, and have no plans to change it in the near future. Next year I might add a much more expensive enterprise plan, for those people who ask about custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits.</p>

		<p>When it comes to recruitment interviews, there's an overwhelmingly popular opinion (on the Internet) that one should test candidates in conditions that do resemble <strong>real-life work scenarios</strong> as much as possible. Tasks &amp; challenges should mimic the ones that the candidate would face in her/his daily work. Everything else (<em>"how many golf balls would fit into Opel Corsa?"</em>) is the subject of laughter and mockery.</p><p>I dare to disagree. My interviews are nothing like real work (but TBH we have a final stage of a "trial day" within the actual team, mainly to check <em>the chemistry</em> between a potential new-joiner and the team members and to give her/him a chance to verify what we've said about the company).</p><p>A recruitment interview is a freaking intense experience. We have a strictly limited time - we can't build full context to get someone up-to-speed with the product details, local specifics, whole workflow, etc. Of course, we can try easy, shallow, "mundane" scenario, but let's face the truth - we need to evaluate candidate's capability to tackle TRULY demanding stuff (most likely <strong>10% of the actual work</strong> (s)he'll perform - but that part truly makes the difference).</p><p>The purpose of the interview is not to emulate work 1:1, but to answer certain questions: about particular personality traits, attitude, aptitude, mindset. Technical skills can always be taught later - if someone has a matching motivation, proper engineering foundation, is bright enough and has an ability of structured abstract thinking.</p><p>That's why my interviews are aimed to check how does the individual think (instead of verifying her/his memorization skills). How does (s)he approach problems, split them, classify them, explore possible solutions? When does (s)he abandon the path that doesn't look promising anymore? Is (s)he able to effectively share her/his thoughts (verbally, graphically, in code)? What about focus - does (s)he navigate in terms of a given goal or roam chaotically around? And in the end ... <strong>is (s)he actually having fun</strong> (when solving challenging problems)?</p><p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do ask abstract questions as well. The problems candidates are facing at my interviews usually have NOTHING in common with the company's domain, BUT they have a super-low entry level (e.g. they are about common problems everyone encounters every day): building up the context takes seconds (literally), so the candidate can focus on tackling the problem, not understanding its basics. They also share one another characteristic: they are picked to be <strong>unique, intriguing and memorable</strong> - so regardless of the outcome (whether the candidate joins us or not), our interview remains an interesting experience in her/his memory.</p><p>There are ones who are surprised and do criticize such a form of the interview. They usually ask whether these exercises truly represent the everyday problems of this organization. Some even get irritated (very few) - but no-one has asked to stop the interview prematurely.</p><p>Honestly, I don't mind. These days candidates get very picky - they have so many offers available in the market, that the less gritty ones don't even want to participate in the interview that exposes them to the challenges out of their comfort zone (e.g. which is - syntactical language problems or knowing the specifics of the framework). It's their right, but it also means they are definitely <strong>not the people I'm looking for</strong>.</p><hr><p>P.S. Of course, sometimes (rarely) I look for a high level of expertise within a specific technological niche - that requires a different assessment and it's a completely separate topic.</p>

Over the same period of time they have created a wide range of computer vision and data analysis tools which have the potential to change forms of policing and incarceration in many places around the world. These innovations, however, have come at the cost of what U.S. lawmakers describe as “</span><a href="https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/EMBARGOED_CECC%202019%20Annual%20Report.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">crimes against humanity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.”</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Technology’s Double-Edged Sword</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that Chinese technology companies are at the cutting edge of surveillance innovation and predictive analytics. In April 2020, Amazon, the wealthiest technology company in the world, received a shipment of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL"><span data-contrast="none">1,500 heat-sensing camera systems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;from the Chinese surveillance company&nbsp;Dahua. Many of these cameras, which are worth approximately $10 million, will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit COVID-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017,&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;received over $900 million to build comprehensive surveillance systems which supported a “re-education” system of extra-legal internment, checkpoints, and ideological training for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision"><span data-contrast="none">Muslim populations in northwestern China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed it on a list of companies banned from buying or selling in the United States. Yet despite the legal and ethical ramifications of buying products from&nbsp;Dahua, Amazon continues to do business with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the help of&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;and hundreds of other private and public Chinese companies, as many as 1.5 million Uighurs and Kazakhs have been “disappeared” into a widespread system of “re-education camps” in the Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).[1]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Nearly all Uighurs and Kazakhs in China have an immediate family member who is, or has been, interned in this camp system. Uighurs now refer to themselves as a “</span><a href="https://livingotherwise.com/2018/07/31/happiest-muslims-world-coping-happiness/"><span data-contrast="none">people destroyed</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.” As I observed during a research trip to the region in 2018, many Uighur-owned businesses have closed across the country. Whole streets have been abandoned in Uighur towns and villages. Because of the re-education system, it is likely that within a single generation Muslim embodied practice and Turkic languages in Northwest China will cease to provide essential ways for Uighurs and Kazakhs to sustain their knowledge systems.[2]&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This process affects every aspect of their lives not only due to mass detentions, but also because of the way biometric and data surveillance systems supporting the camps have been used to monitor and transform their behavior.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[3]</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This terrain assessment describes how Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang were targeted by digital and biometric surveillance technologies of the “re-education” system. Its main conclusion is that the world is witnessing the birth of a new form of technology-enabled systems of social and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">behavioral control. This rise in authoritarian statecraft coincides with breakthroughs in face surveillance, voice recognition, automated data recovery tools and algorithmic assessments of social media histories in China’s private and public technology industry.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many of the dozens of former detainees and inhabitants of the region I interviewed while researching the technological aspects of the re-education system said that they or those they knew were detained because of digital texts, audio clips, and videos that they had shared on their smartphones.</span><span data-contrast="auto">iv</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">In numerous cases, former detainees told me they met people in the camps who&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/provocations/coercive-reeducation-technologies-actually-work/"><span data-contrast="none">were detained</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;because they had used their ID card to register multiple SIM cards, they had installed Facebook or WhatsApp on their Android phones, or they had used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to circumvent China’s “great firewall.” All of these “pre-crimes” could be construed as part of a list of 75&nbsp;</span><a href="http://archive.fo/TlazC"><span data-contrast="none">official signs of Islamic extremism</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Police departments across the region began to employ “police contractors” to check people’s devices using artificial intelligence-enabled auto-recovery tools built by the Chinese tech giant&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Meiya</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Pico and others.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[4]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">State workers and automated data collection systems&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">fed this information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;into a region-wide&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP)</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Authorities used this system, along with data collected through interrogations, to determine which Muslims were “unsafe” and in need of&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">detention</span><span data-contrast="auto">.[5]</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Inside the formal “re-education camps,” detainees were subjected to comprehensive monitoring.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[6]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The lights inside their cells were extremely bright. They were never turned off.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">In&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">interviews, former detainees</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;who were held in camps across the region told me that at no point during the day or night were detainees permitted to obscure the view of their faces from the cameras. If they covered their eyes with their hand or a&nbsp;blanket&nbsp;they would receive an immediate warning from a guard via the speaker system in the cell.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">People who were not immediately detained were nevertheless ordered to go to local police stations and clinics to submit blood and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions">DNA samples</a> have their irises, faces and fingerprints scanned and a unique voice signature recorded.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">One Kazakh woman told me, “The village government leader told us openly that those who refused would be taken to the re-education camps.” This biometric data was then added to their citizenship file as part of a new “smart” ID card system. Once this system was fully implemented by the end of 2017, it became impossible for Uighurs and Kazakhs to enter a bank or shopping mall without having their face scanned and matched to the image on their ID at fixed checkpoints. Han people were often waved through these checkpoints without a scan,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chinachannel.org/2018/11/23/checkpoint-nation/"><span data-contrast="none">particularly in Turkic Muslim majority areas</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The Kazakh woman told me, “On average, over the span of a single day, I had my ID and face scanned more than 10 times.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is unclear how all of this data is used. As James&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Leibold</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;has noted, there is likely a significant gap between the advertised capacities of the systems in place and their actual ability to turn biometric and digital data into actionable forms of social control.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[9]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Much of the data in the IJOP system is input manually or through targeted scans of smart phones, while other forms of data are fed into the system through banking records, GPS tracking and license plate and face recognition camera systems. Yet despite potential gaps in purported knowledge and technical capability, the ubiquity of checkpoints and cameras make Turkic Muslims modify their behavior in their daily life and reorient their activities around ideals promoted by state authorities. The technologies begin to create a new reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Logic of Chinese Counterterrorism&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The history of Chinese counterterrorism is born largely out of post-9/11 counterinsurgency theory (COIN). Soon after U.S. Army General Petraeus crafted a new counterinsurgency field manual in 2007, Chinese military and policing scientists began to consider what they could learn from a <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2019/10/25/preventative-policing-as-community-detention-in-northwest-china/">new approach</a> to asymmetrical warfare.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">They considered central COIN principles such as full spectrum intelligence; placing people in categories of insurgent, neutral, and pro-regime change populations; breaking up social networks through targeted detentions; and “winning the hearts and minds” of those who remained.[10]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As elements of counterinsurgency theory were implemented in the United States and Europe in the form of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs that strove to “deradicalize” Muslim citizens, Chinese policing theorists began to think more about “preventative policing” and the way surveillance and education systems could be used to transform non-Han Muslim populations.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[11]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Building on an intelligence-led policing program called&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">the Golden Shield project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that had already been established post-9/11, they took note of Edward Snowden’s revelations of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"><span data-contrast="none">PRISM mass data analytics project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that collected and assessed data from social media both in the United States and around the globe.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

<h3 id="enable-performance-mode">Enable performance mode</h3>
<p>The systems UEFI or BIOS usually have a setting for energy profile that adjusts
available CPU power states, you should set this to “maximum performance” or
equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="disable-hyper-threading">Disable hyper-threading</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Hyper-threading (HT)</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</a>
is a technology to maximize processor resource usage for workloads with low
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle">instructions per cycle (IPC)</a>.
Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources it’s recommended to
turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources. Disabling HT/SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of
2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>
<h3 id="enable-turbo-boost">Enable Turbo Boost</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="overclocking">Overclocking</h3>
<p>Consider overclocking your processors. Running your processor at higher
frequency will reduce jitter and latency. It’s not possible to overclock Intel
Xeon server processors, but you can overclock Intel’s consumer gaming processors
and AMD’s processors.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts
</code></pre><p>References:</p>

<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a
</code></pre><p>Your application will still incur major page faults when accessing <em>file backed
memory mappings</em> …</p></div></div>

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this <code>grayify_cmap</code> snippet helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10dc06ec-da7f-4513-8b37-6c17f9f48df5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195239Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8e0371bdd6fe0b12f7ac92c0736c17cd0b656d4058c36f38692590967a3d03b8&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cc718120-451e-45f4-99c1-09cbde8627c1/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195107Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7e22925f4c8f52d02ee569f3093de6861ed0aefe5b79db1c1a163a9cd1e0ce8a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cbfe0681-f35f-475a-be81-4dda8603de98/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195127Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0e89220104974d5015b313efa4866b04c500b97dd8c7e3ae10e3ab52778f622f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ee2cde0-474d-4bb9-aee6-82e8408587e9/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195152Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=545de8bbe5c384fca3b4668795bca49bbb3a3fc6c79e24d9562a517907b44628&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p> <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>
