November 18, 2020 | http://amortizedcost.net/ui-desing-for-software-developer-part-1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://amortizedcost.net/ui-desing-for-software-developer-part-1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this series of articles, I will show full process of creating a UI design for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Batch Image Shrinker</a> (<a href="market://details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Google play link</a>) mobile application which I did by myself. As a software developer always I've been thinking that UI design is not for me, that it's complex and requires some art skill or something.</p>
<p>It's a myth and I will try to debunk it.</p>
<p>I will show you that UI design is for everyone, you just need to know some basic technics and a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I promise you it will be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="dominatingcolor">Dominating color</h2>
<p>With the dominating presence of dark-mode, I noticed that for me it was easier to work with darker colors as baseline colors than with brighter ones, and since  I almost always use dark-mode of the applications, so I wanted to have something similar in my application. I was certain that I didn't want to use <a href="https://colornames.org/color/3b5998">Facebook blue</a> color and it's successors, so I had to find something more futuristic and brave than that. My choice fell on <code>#464d77</code> which is a very intense dark blue, almost purple color.</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09"></p>
<p>Common advice here will be not to use pure black or white colors, which, as perfectly described in <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">the article</a>, hardly present in the real-world color pallet. <em>What a coincidence, I found <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect.html">a website</a> with a perfect example of dark background color and great content to read.</em></p>
<h2 id="colorpalette">Color palette</h2>
<p>Of cause, just one baseline color will not be enough to build a feature-rich application. You will need a couple of colors for different types of components like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. Another one or two colors will be needed for the text itself. Also,  some gradients for several states of a component, such as "active", "disabled", "pressed". So before creating an actual UI, we will need to have a rich pallet of colors to work with. In my case, I ended up with 6 colors in total which was more than enough to create a simple yet interesting UI.</p>
<p>This step is much easier than the previous one, because here we will be either reusing or generating new color pallets using the baseline color from the previous part.</p>
<p>The generator which I was using is <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/f9db6d">this</a>. Here you could either put the color hex into a search bar or simply choose the pallet from the <a href="https://coolors.co/a1e8af-94c595-747c92-372772-3a2449">hundreds</a> of pre-generated ones. If the color range is not enough for you, try to extend it with <a href="https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette">another</a> good palette generator. Put on the left side the baseline color and select how many colors you will need.</p>
<p>Pro-tip, you can combine those tools to get even more combinations. As you can see here, I was using a baseline color on the right side and colors from <a href="https://coolors.co/464d77-36827f-f9db6d-f4eded-877666">the palette</a> as values for the right side of the generator:</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31"><br>
<img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04"></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results try to get back to choosing the baseline color and repeat the whole process again. Since we are learning it's ok to do multiple roundtrips until your gut feelings tell you that that is it.</p>
<p>Once we are done with the color schema we are good to go to we move to the next step - choosing fonts, which will be covered next time.</p>

<![CDATA[Cobalt – Lightweight Electron Alternative]]>
            </title>
            <description>

November 18, 2020 | https://cobalt.foo/overview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cobalt.foo/overview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centerCol">
      <div id="content">
        <p>Cobalt is a lightweight HTML5/CSS/JS application container that is designed
to provide a rich application development environment with minimal resource
consumption (deployment size, RAM, CPU, GPU). At the same time, Cobalt enables
a rich, low-latency user experience across a wide variety of platforms and
devices.</p>

<h4 id="target-audiences">Target audiences</h4>

<p>Cobalt's documentation is written with two audiences in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Porters</strong> enable Cobalt to work on other platforms by using Starboard,
Cobalt's porting layer and OS abstraction, to implement the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. Each Starboard module
(memory, socket, thread, etc.) defines functions that must be implemented
for the porter's platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong> want to build applications in familiar environments with
advanced debugging tools without having to worry about compatibility with
a highly fragmented set of browsers. At the same time, they want to have
full control over their codebase so that they can ship features for
constrained platforms, like TVs, on time and without technical risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-cobalt">Benefits of Cobalt</h2>

<p>Cobalt significantly reduces the cost of supporting a browser on non-standard
and resource-constrained platforms. In addition, since Cobalt operates at a
consolidated, versioned platform abstraction layer, its porting effort is
man-weeks, and subsequent rebases are near-free.</p>

<p>These are some other benefits that Cobalt provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>More platforms</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt does not require platforms to support JIT compilation and can
run on platforms that disallow execution of dynamically generated code.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is a single-process application and does not rely on the ability
to spawn multiple processes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt precompiles a set of shaders that are sufficient to express all
graphical effects, thereby accommodating platforms that cannot compile
shaders at runtime.</li>
<li>  Cobalt requires a compliant C++11 compiler, allowing it to reach
platforms with toolchains that don't support the newest C++17 features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Small footprint</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized for memory. Its surface cache never exceeds a
predefined budget, and it never creates duplicate layers, reducing
the likelihood of out-of-memory crashes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt's small binary is designed to take up as little space as
possible. By supporting a subset of HTML5/CSS/JS, Cobalt's reduced
package size even allows bundling of CJK fonts on low-end devices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced input latency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt produces consistent 60FPS animations by only supporting
animation of properties that don't affect layout, like <code>transform</code>,
and always running animations on a separate thread.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized to run on single-core CPUs, resulting in better
input latency since the renderer and resource loader do not compete
with layout operations.</li>
<li>  On platforms that support GLES2, Cobalt avoids CPU painting by
performing almost all rendering operations on the GPU.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="porters">Porters</h3>

<p>Porters should begin with the <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/porting.html">porting guide</a>,
which explains how to use Starboard, Cobalt's porting layer, to customize the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. There are several reference
documents to help porters customize configuration files and to implement
module-specific functionality. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/testing.html">Testing with
NPLB</a> document provides an overview of
Starboard's compliance test suite.</p>

<h3 id="developers">Developers</h3>

<p>Developers can follow the setup instructions for
<a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/setup-linux.html">Linux</a> or
<a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/setup-raspi.html">RasPi</a> to set up their Cobalt development
environment, fetch a copy of the Cobalt code repository, and build a Cobalt
binary. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/reference/supported-features.html">Cobalt support</a>
guide lists the HTML elements, CSS properties, CSS selectors, and JavaScript Web
APIs that developers can use in their Cobalt applications.</p>

<br/>
November 18, 2020 | http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">
<p>This is a description of using I/Q Data (aka "analytic signal") representing a signal. Since the topic may be quite confusing, I've described the same thing here from different point of views. If you find the information somewhat redundant, it is because it is. Different views may appeal to different readers, and if something seems unclear, keep on reading and it may be more comprehensible later - hopefully.
</p>
<h2>Why I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>I/Q Data is a signal representation much more precise than just using a series of samples of the momentary amplitude of the signal. Have a look at the following signal below.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/cosample.png" alt="Plain signal" title="Plain signal"></p>
<p>This is what you may be used to work with. So why I/Q Data - isn't this good enough?
</p>
<p>Not really. We have a few problems here.
</p>
<ul><li>First, it is impossible to determine the frequency of this signal. Sure, it looks simple enough, just look at the period length? True, but you have no clue if it's a positive or negative frequency since they both generate the same curve. I.e. cos(x) = cos(-x). This becomes a problem working with the signal. Mixing (multiplying) two signals and it'll cause multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the sign: f1 âŠ— f2 equals f1 + f2 as well as f1 - f2.
</li><li>Second, it's hard to determine the power (peak amplitude, envelope) of the signal. Basically you can only see the peak amplitude here at 0Â°, 180Â°, 360Â° etc, and how do you know the power is the same everywhere else as well? And did you sample the signal exactly at its peak? You really don't know.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data solves this. Instead of looking at the signal as a flat curve as above, look at it as a corkscrew (helix, spiral, coil spring) in three dimensions.
</p>

<p>Now if you look at this curve from the side, you'll actually get the same graph as the first one above. Your "real" signal actually is this 2D projection of this corkscrew signal. This is your "I" in I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkI.png" alt="Side view" title="Side view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now have a look at the corkscrew from above. This looks quite similar, but as you see, it is out of phase 90Â°  starting at zero, not at one as the other. This this the Q part of your I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkQ.png" alt="Top view" title="Top view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now looking at the corkscrew down the time axis you'll see it winds counter-clockwise. This means we know the frequency is positive. It could have wound clockwise as well, still generating the same I-signal (projection) but different Q-signal, representing a negative frequency.
</p>
<p>You also see that the radius of the corkscrew is constant at every sample, if small in I large in Q and vice versa. The radius is the peak amplitude of your signal. 
</p>
<p>The axes are of course 90Â°, so the radius must be equal to (IÂ²+QÂ²)<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the peak amplitude of your signal, and as you can see you know this for each and every sample.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkT.png" alt="Viewed down time axis" title="Viewed down time axis"></p>
<h2>What is I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>AS you now understand, the I/Q Data Sample is the coordinates of your signal as seen down the time axis of the corkscrew.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/onesample.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>You might object that your signal isn't a pure cosine function as the one we have shown here, and it might be very true. Still, every single sample of your signal can be described as such, i.e. with a peak amplitude times cosine of some phase angle.
</p>
<p>Every single point of your signal can be described as the function Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you may freely chose any amplitude A and angle Ï• this must of course be true (as long as the signal is continuous). The value of Aâ‹…cos(Ï•) is the <strong>I</strong> component of the I/Q signal, i.e. your real signal. Note that this only describes your signal in one single point, i.e. one sample. Next sample gives you a new I and Q very likely resulting in another amplitude and/or phase angle, reflecting the modulation of the signal.
</p>
<h2>One sample I/Q Data</h2>
<p>Ok, lets take one sample of I/Q Data and see what it represents. This is also called a phase vector, or phasor.
</p>
<pre>I = 0.69
Q = 0.40
</pre>
<p>Lets draw this in the complex plane.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/iqdraw1.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Lets see what this tells us about our data point.
</p>
<ul><li>The momentary amplitude of our real signal is by definition <strong>I</strong>, i.e. 0.69
</li><li>Pythagoras tells us the amplitude A of the cosine wave is <code>(0.69Â²+0.40Â²)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.8</code>
</li><li>Trigonometry tells us our angle is +30Â° into our cosine wave.
</li></ul><p>- <em>Hold it</em>, you say, <em>what cosine wave?</em>
</p>
<p>Well, I/Q actually assumes your real signal (<strong>I</strong>, that is) can be described as the
function <strong>I</strong> = Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you are free to chose A and Ï• this must of course be true, as long the function is continuous. Remember we are looking at one single sample now, i.e. one point in time.
</p>
<p>So by using IQ Data we not only get the momentary values of our signal, but the function generating it as well. If we put above together we get:
</p>
<p>The real signal I = 0.8â‹…cos(30Â°)
</p>
<hr>
<ul><li>I/Q Data is the representation (data type) of this cosine function.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data is the rectangular representation of the polar notation we used above. There is a unique transformation between the two, and the different notations have different properties calculating with them. The rectangular form of I/Q Data is chosen due to the ease of hardware implementations of the most common operations.
</p>
<p>I/Q Data consists of I and Q represented as two separate variables, a vector of length two, or more often, the complex number  I + Q<em>i</em>  (yes, I is the real part).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/polrep.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Note that the Amplitude above is the waves peak amplitude, not the momentary amplitude.
</p>
<ul><li>I is the current momentary amplitude of the signal (i.e. the Real signal)
</li><li>Q is the momentary amplitude of the signal phase shifted -90Â°.
</li></ul><p>For a simple function such as sine, the phase shift is what the signal was earlier in time, but for a signal with more than one sine component, Q reflects a -90Â° shift of the individual components, and not the composite signal as such. To convert a Real Signal to a I/Q Data Signal, discrete Fourier transformation is required (Hilberts transform).
</p>
<h2>Different ways of representing the same I/Q Data Sample</h2>
<p>There are at least three common ways to represent the I/Q Data Sample. Different representations gives you different pros and cons. Some are more easy to add, other are more easy to multiply etc. This may be important in the implementation, resulting in less complex hardware/software using the best representation.
</p>
<h3>The rectangular form</h3>
<p>The I/Q Data on the form Q and I is called "rectangular" (or "Cartesian") form as it can be viewed as positions in a coordinate system. I and Q are the x and y axis respectively. This is the most common representation you are used to. This form is most common due the ease of modulating/demodulating it in hardware. More about that later.
</p>
<ul><li>As a complex number: I + Q<em>i</em>
</li><li>As a vector [I,Q]
</li><li>Or just the two plain variables I and Q
</li></ul><h3>The polar form</h3>
<ul><li>Amplitude and angle
</li></ul><p>I = Amplitudeâ‹…cos(angle) <br>Q = Amplitudeâ‹…sin(angle)
</p>
<p>The Amplitude is the peak amplitude of the cos (and sin) function, and the angle is how far into the period from zero to 360Â° you are (or 0 to 2Ï€ if you prefers radians).
</p>
<h3>Eulers form</h3>
<p>Since cos(Ï•) + iâ‹…sin(Ï•) = e<sup>iÏ•</sup> we can write our IQ sample as
</p>
<p><span> Ae<sup>iÏ•</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>This might (not?) be the most intuitive representation of the sample. Ï• rotates the angle as seen in the polar representation, and A is of course the amplitude. Realizing this, Eulers identity becomes obvious. Because Ï• is the rotation of the vector in the complex plane, rotating it half a turn, 180Â° or Ï€ radians, results in a real part of -1 and no imaginary part, hence:
</p>
<p><span> e<sup>Ï€i</sup>+1 = 0 </span>
</p>
<p><em>"The student should find this to be immediately obvious,</em> <br><em>otherwise he'll never be a first rate mathematician"</em>
</p>
<p><em>-- Carl Friedrich Gauss </em>
</p>
<h2>Positive versus negative frequency</h2>
<p>It is now easy to see that using I/Q we can represent the signal frequency either as positive or negative. Have a look at the two I/Q signals red and blue below to the left and compare them with their corresponding real projections. It is as obvious they differ in signs in I/Q, as it's impossible to determine the signs using only the real signal component (neither the I nor the Q projection separately).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/freqsign.gif" alt="Positive versus negative frequencies" title="Positive versus negative frequencies"></p>
<p><span>(sidenote: I've put them slightly out of phase compared to each other since else they wouldn't be possible to distinguish at all in the real representation to the right. Also, please note I'm here, quiet unconventional, using the x axis in the phasor for the imaginary <strong>Q</strong>)</span>
</p>
<p>The same signal (well, more or less) in a 3D representation.
</p>
<p>The <strong>I</strong> components (side view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-i.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Q</strong> components (top view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-q.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The I/Q signals in 3D:
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-3d.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p><a name="twopriceone" id="twopriceone"></a>
As the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states you can only represent
frequencies up to <code>f/2</code> using a samplings rate of <code>f</code>. This is still true
using IQ Data, but since you now can represent negative frequencies
the signal spans <code>[-f/2..+f/2]</code> compared to <code>[0..+f/2]</code> using a â„�eal signal,
hence the range is in effect doubled. Using a
sampling rate of <code>f</code> and you now can represent a signal range of <code>f</code> as well.
Two to the price of one!
</p>
<h2>Mixing and multiplying signals</h2>
<p>Using real signals or IQ Signals gives different results when you multiply them. This is because using only the real component it's not possible to uniquely determine the phase angle of the signal, hence impossible to distinguish a positive frequency from a negative.
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-real.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real"></span></p>
<p>Multiplying two signals f1 and f2 in the real domain:
</p>
<p><span> Â±f1 âŠ— Â±f2 = (Â±)f1 Â± f2 </span>
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-iq.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q"></span></p>
<p>Using IQ Data the signs are now given, and the result is unambiguous:
</p>
<p><span> f1 âŠ— f2 = f1 + f2 </span>
</p>
<p><br>
A frequency spectrum in the real domain usually never show the negative side, since it always must be symmetric around zero due to the uncertainty of the sign of the frequency of the real signal -- hence the parentheses around the sign of <code>f1</code> in the first formula mixing the real signals. I've included the negative side here for illustrative purposes, despite of its redundancy.
</p>
<p>Multiplying two complex number is easiest understood in the polar representation. The amplitude is multiplied and the angle added.
</p>
<p><span> A<sub>1</sub>â‹…e<sup>iÏ•<sub>1</sub></sup>â‹…A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>iÏ•<sub>2</sub></sup> = A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>i(Ï•<sub>1</sub>+Ï•<sub>2</sub>)</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>Realizing the angle is added under multiplication makes it obvious that the frequencies are added as well.
</p>

<p>Now let us have a look at this in time domain. To make it easier (doable!) to calculate the DFT in our …</p></div></div>

		<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/5841gmvz8i7y8mycchzx.png" alt="Generate Website Admin Panel"></p>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>
<p>At the end, you may also check:</p>

            <!-- .entry-header -->


            <div>
                
<p>The heartbreak continues for those of us that relied on Sony’s websites to find and buy games or to research what was available. After <a href="https://delistedgames.com/sony-makes-it-official-playstation-3-psp-vita-removed-from-psn-website-between-october-21-and-26/">cutting out</a> older PlayStation content from the PlayStation Store over the past month, Sony’s eye has seemingly fallen on PlayStation.com and I find myself feeling gutted this morning. For those who didn’t use it regularly, PlayStation.com housed a gargantuan history of pages for North American PlayStation releases going all the way back to the original console from 1995. Up until this week you could easily find titles using the search box on the site but now anything before the PlayStation 4 returns a disappointing “<em>0 results found</em>“.</p>



<p>The older pages weren’t overflowing with info but they did offer some product details that I couldn’t easily find elsewhere. For newer games these pages also frequently retained links to the PlayStation Store which helped in my research. Even when they <em>were</em> on sale some games were just hard to find on the PlayStation Store while their PlayStation.com pages linked directly to them. Sometimes these pages were among the scant bits of evidence that I could find to confirm these games even existed digitally. Now, like with the changes to the PlayStation Store, all that’s gone too. Well, mostly gone.</p>



<p>Thankfully, like our “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old PS Store</a>” workaround, there’s still a way to search PlayStation.com but it might also eventually go away. Google’s “search within a site” function has been around for nearly a decade at this point but I’m sure lots of people don’t even know it exists. For our purposes just head to <em>the Google</em>, type ‘site:playstation.com’ and then whatever game you’re looking for. You can use Google’s other search operators to refine the results as well. Put it all together and it looks something like this: <strong>site:playstation.com “age of booty”</strong></p>



<p>You’ll get search results across the playstation.com domain including PlayStation Blog posts and PlayStation Store pages but look for the ones that specifically state ‘www.playstation.com’. In the case of Age of Booty the page gives us a description and even some screenshots as well as a ‘Buy Download’ link. Of course, the download page has been hidden by Sony’s recent changes to their sites but the URL remains accessible so you can check other territories or check it out using the “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old</a>” method. Yes, <a href="https://delistedgames.com/age-of-booty/">Age of Booty</a> is still delisted on PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Maybe it was just a feature that only <strong><em>I</em></strong> benefited from but it’s really sad to see Sony ostensibly kill 25 years of PlayStation content on the web. It makes the nostalgia trip of Astro’s Playroom feel a little more hollow.</p>

Are you ready to be treated as a second-class employee just because of the geography that you live in?</p><p><em>How will you know that all the lousy work doesn't get passed on to you because it is justified in terms of 'returns on investment'?</em></p><p>When your manager has the final say, isn't it possible that they distribute work so that a low-risk, low-impact project is assigned to you while your "more expensive" peers get assigned the high-risk, high impact one?</p><p><strong>HR at your COL company</strong><em>: "We have a policy that says we won't discriminate based on the employee's location."</em></p><p>That's all well and good but what about the silent bias.</p><p><em>How can you be sure that your extremely well-meaning manager wasn't thinking about it when they assign you a project that you don't like? Wouldn't they be making a wise decision that is justified in terms of returns of investment? Can you be sure that they won't?</em></p><h3 id="-2-differences-in-government-spending-across-countries">#2. Differences in Government spending across countries</h3><p>Public spending enables governments to produce and purchase goods and services, in order to fulfil their objectives – such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources - like social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also tends to be more focused on social protection.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes!

</figure><p>In India, the government spent about 1,700 US dollars per head (adjusted based on Purchasing Power Parity) in the year 2015; while in countries such as Norway, that figure was over 30,000 US dollars (adjusted based on PPP) and in USA it was over 21,000 USD.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/government-spending">https://ourworldindata.org/government-spending</a></p><p>This lack of government spending is ultimately passed on to the citizens who need to pay for these benefits with their own money, thus reflecting it in their costs of living.</p><p>An impotent public schooling system means that employees need to send their children to expensive private schools. A broken public hospital infracture means that people need to avail the expensive private hospitals for their healthcare. And a lot of these private enterprises are not above profiteering in times of crises.</p><p><em>How does cost of living based compensation take into account the differences in government spending accross countries?

</figure><p>So, how do you define the "Cost of Living"?</p><p>Is it just the housing prices? And groceries? Restaurant bills, maybe?</p><p>That seems incomplete.

In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>I can’t believe we’re at post number five! It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ve been blown away by the helpful feedback from the Rust community at large. Thank you to everyone for all of the warm help.</p><p>Whilst I’m still in my infancy with Rust, it’s getting harder and harder to hold the itch to learn more. Often I want nothing more than to open the Rust Book and truck on with learning, blog posts be darned! However, I’ve made my commitment to myself, you and the Book, so every night; write, I do.</p><p>I’ve decided to make this post a <em>triple</em>, so let’s begin where we left off!</p><h3 id="7-packages-and-crates-and-stuffhttpsdocrust-langorgbookch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-moduleshtmlmanaging-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">7. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html#managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">Packages and Crates and Stuff</a></h3><p>Right off the bat, I think this chapter is very well-placed. Even though it took me the entire chapter <em>grok</em> crates, modules and packages; I don’t think it came a line too early or late. Bravo! The chapter introduced many new keywords, such as <code>use</code>, <code>pub</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>super</code>, but you walk away feeling like you can actually use them properly.</p><h4 id="modules">Modules</h4><p>Modules are introduced leaning heavily on the analogy of a file system… Now given that modules, at the most granular level, can be defined as single files <em>with the module name</em>, I’m actually wondering how much of this <em>is an analogy</em> and how much of it is really what’s happening at the compiler level. I would grin so hard if the bit about <strong><code>use</code></strong> being <em>like</em> a symlink <em>was</em> actually just a thing that was happening somewhere in the build chain. I’m sure it’s not though… Right.</p><h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4><p>I enjoyed how the authors talked about privacy through scope. It helped me link project structure ideas with programming rules. For some reason I always thought of privacy as logical rules applied to code after the fact, rather than just having or not having something within a certain scope. It’s a lot easier to think about the later way. All this being said, there was also an overarching “Restaurant” example which they tried to tie in with privacy - check this gem:</p><blockquote><p>The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default. […] To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.</p></blockquote><p>… I think that metaphor died somewhere in the rafters above the restaurant, and the smell could be starting to affect the food. Sorry.</p><p>For those who don’t know, privacy in Go is defined by whether you capitalize the first letter of your func/struct/interface name. Whilst lean and consistent - I much prefer the Rust approach. Rust is private by default unless you plop a <code>pub</code> in front of it. The main irk I have with the Go way is that Go’s naming convention also tells you acronyms should be entirely uppercase. So what happens when you want a private struct called <code>jsonData</code>? Well you have to think of something else because calling it <code>JSONData</code> will make it publicly exported and <code>jsonData</code> is not idiomatic. It’s definitely but only a nit, however I’ve become (unreasonably?) irked by it on more than one occasion.</p><h5 id="clean-your-room">Clean your room!</h5><p>The lesson proved once again that the Rust compiler is helpful. Gentle warnings about my variables being unused really makes me feel cared for. Go isn’t like this. Go grabs you by your collar and pierces your eardrums with a shrewd screech. It won’t let you go either. Like a harpy, the tiny chipmunk won’t let up. Thank Crabby for small mercies is all I can say.</p><p>On a more serious note though, I like this choice by Rust - my preference for most things I’d code would be to enforce compiler errors for unused variables; but it should be a compiler option; which as far as I know - it is <strong>not</strong>, in Go. I’m going to guess you should be able to upgrade the Rust warnings to errors through compiler flags somehow.</p><h5 id="re-exporting-imports">Re-exporting Imports</h5><p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">feature</a> of Rust gives me mixed feelings. As I understand it, when you <code>use</code> a package, that package can then bring more packages into your scope? I mean it does make sense from a library user-experience perspective, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a bit of trust going on here, if not only taste-trust. It’s definitely nice to just <code>use</code> a crate once and have everything you need to interact with it.</p><p>There’s only one Rust project I’m really interested in right now - a Game engine and editor called <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d">rg3d</a>. I checked that project’s source for re-exports and found some in the top level <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/blob/master/src/lib.rs"><code>lib.rs</code></a>. Basically it just imports its own submodules publicly. I have no idea if this is idiomatic but to my lay-eyes this use-case looks correct and just.</p><p>Rust has been giving me a strong Java vibe from its imports. The nested paths feature seems good - ugly but succinct. Maybe my editor or <code>rustfmt</code> will automatically manage this for me? I enjoy not needing to worry about imports 99% of the time in Go, thanks to <code>goimports</code>, so hopefully that trend will continue in Rust.</p><h5 id="prelude-to-nothing">Prelude to Nothing</h5><p>In previous posts I mentioned being wooed by wistful mentions of a <code>prelude</code> by the Book. Well this chapter mentioned it again, and more than wistfully. It drowned my unquenchable satiety with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html">this link</a>, which to my utmost sorrow, was not a chapter in the Book. Alas, I read it in spite the fact. Oh, but my heart was flattened like my toddler’s playdough on a Sunday morning, for I was to find <strong>the prelude</strong> means nothing more than the default set of imports for a program. Through the sobriety of hindsight, I do question what else I was expecting. Given Rust doesn’t have a runtime, it doesn’t need anything fancy. Oh well, at least the great prelude mystery is solved.</p><h3 id="8-common-collectionshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch08-00-common-collectionshtml"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html">8. Common Collections</a></h3><p>I just want to take a moment to swoon over Rust’s type inference again.</p><p>*<em><strong>swoons</strong></em>*</p><p>It’s fantastic. This is all…</p><hr><p>Now for actual chapter 8; it’s fairly dense. Covered is a brief introduction of standard library’s collections, Vectors, HashMaps and finally a deep dive into Rust Strings. Let’s begin the blow-by-blow starting with this gem:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"The first element is: {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Guess what won’t compile? Correct - the code above! What’s happening here is that <code>v</code> is mutable and <code>first</code> is immutable. If <code>v</code> needs to grow from something like a push; then this may end up moving the entire heap-allocated vector into another part of the heap. Had this to happen, then <code>first</code> would be a “dangling” ref to what <em>used</em> to be the first element of <code>v</code>.</p><p>Now what really tickles me is wondering about how that enforcement is encoded - what is <code>first</code> a reference to exactly? The Vec? No, my IDE tells me it’s an <code>&amp;i32</code> ref… But, somehow the compiler knows that <em>THAT</em> i32 ref is a child, or related to the Vec in the same scope. I
’d love to know more about how this works.</p><p>Perhaps not by major coincidence the Book offers up possibly the most perfect lead for such questions only paragraphs later… The Book introduces the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec.html">Rustinomicon</a>, telling us that we can peer into it to see details about how <code>vec</code> is made… At first, I was a little tense. Why does this reference-style-looking book have the Lovecraftian name? Only when I glimpsed the first line of its opening, did the ink droplets align:</p><h3 id="the-dark-arts-of-unsafe-rust"><code>The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust</code></h3><p>…<em>followed by</em></p><p>THE KNOWLEDGE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF UNLEASHING INDESCRIBABLE HORRORS THAT SHATTER YOUR PSYCHE AND SET YOUR MIND ADRIFT IN THE UNKNOWABLY INFINITE COSMOS.</p><h4 id="okay-this-looks-awesome"><strong>OKAY THIS LOOKS AWESOME</strong>.</h4><p>Flipping back to the <code>vec</code> chapter of the Rustinomicon, I realised it’s not at all a boring appendix style libdoc for vectors - the god damn tomb is teaching you to write your <em>OWN</em> std::Vec from scratch!</p><p>Good God, this is made me bite my lip in awkward nuclear attraction. I had some plans in mind for what I wanted to write about after this series. Right now the thought of doing a mini-series through the nomcon is sounding mighty fine though.. <em>More to come on this later</em>, as I managed to pry myself away and back to the lesson at hand.</p><hr><p>Looking through the method list (by god the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">doc pages</a> are ugly; hint - only use the sidebar to navigate, do not bother free-scrolling), <code>vec</code> REALLY has some cool funcs. <code>dedup</code>, <code>drain</code>, <code>retain</code> all look to do what you’d expect. I jaunted quickly through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>std::iter:Iterator</code></a> too and found SO many nice to haves, such as <code>gt</code>, <code>is_sorted</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, <code>filter</code>…</p><p>Seriously, I know there’s a lot you wouldn’t need here - but I really do wish we had simple collections/traits outside of slices and maps in Go. And yes, before I get screamed at - <em>I know</em> you can write your own in <a href="https://gobyexample.com/collection-functions">a few lines</a>, but it’s not the same - especially when you start involving complex data types. Being able to just conform to standard interfaces for elegance is something I adore and miss.</p><h4 id="string-theory">String Theory</h4><p>The chapter devotes a large swath to Strings and UTF-8. At first, I thought “how boring”, but then I realised I am the boring one! This is a much more interesting problem than I gave credit for and it made me go back to Go to better understand the “rune” system it uses for strings.</p><p>First, strings; there’s actually shit-loads of them in Rust… <code>OsString</code>, <code>CString</code>, <code>CStr</code>, <code>OsStr</code>… How wrong I was to assume a single String type in Rust indeed.</p><p>The stdlib provides many helpful functions over regular <code>String</code>. In Go, string is a part of <code>builtin</code>, but you use the stdlib’s <code>strings</code> package for more helpers.</p><hr><p><strong>Random question</strong>: Is there a difference between <code>String::from("")</code> and <code>String::new()</code>? According to this test; no:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>    </span><span>assert_eq</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>from</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>new</span><span>());</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>I’ve seen both methods being used so far and am not sure which one is “better”/idiomatic.</p><h4 id="indexing-into-strings">Indexing into Strings</h4><blockquote><p>A final reason …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A quick summary of Postgres views, materialized views, and why you should use them.</p><h3>What is a View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view</a> is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Say we have the following tables from a database of a university:</p><p><strong>students</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Arun</td><td>undergraduate</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Zack</td><td>graduate</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Joy</td><td>graduate</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>courses</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>title</th><th>code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introduction to Postgres</td><td>PG101</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Authentication Theories</td><td>AUTH205</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fundamentals of Supabase</td><td>SUP412</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>grades</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>student_id</th><th>course_id</th><th>result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>B-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Creating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Once done, we can now access the underlying query with:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3>Why should we use Views?</h3><p>Views provide the several benefits:</p><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Logical Organization</li><li>Security</li></ul><h4>Simplicity</h4><p>As a query becomes complex it becomes a hassle to call it. Especially when we run it at regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We can run this instead:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Additionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table <code>JOIN</code>s or even create new views using existing views.</p><h4>Consistency</h4><p>Views ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course <em>Introduction to Postgres</em>. The query would become:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>where</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>code </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>'PG101'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Without a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view <strong>transcripts</strong>. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.</p><h4>Logical Organization</h4><p>With views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can easily explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view <strong>transcripts</strong>, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the <strong>students</strong>, <strong>courses</strong>, and <strong>grades</strong> tables.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>Views can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.</p><h3>What is a Materialized View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materialized view</a> is a form of view but with the added feature of physically storing the results. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Using our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Reading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-creatematerializedview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h4>Refreshing</h4><p>Unfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>refresh materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>It's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.</p><h3>Materialized views vs Conventional views</h3><p>Materialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views become unbearable or exceed the service level agreements of a business. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and millions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.</p><p>Creating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Postgres views and materialized views are a great way to organize and view results from commonly used queries. Although similar to one another, each has its purpose. Views simplify the process of running queries. Materialized views are usually faster at returning results, with the trade-off of having stale data.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>This is a small story about tracking down a production bug in a Rust
application. I don’t know if there’s any take away from this one for the reader,
but it felt interesting so I’m sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h2>

<p>In Avast, we have a Rust application called <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It serves as a backend to
some other applications, provides them a HTTP API. It’s in Rust because it is
latency critical. Latencies of most requests are under a millisecond.</p>

<p>It was written with <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*"><code>tokio-0.1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.*"><code>hyper-0.12</code></a> to deal with the HTTP. We
were quite late to update to newer versions, in part because it worked fine and
the amount of <code>async</code> code was single quite short function, so we didn’t have
much motivation. And in part because we use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> libraries for
configuration. It’s a library to take configuration and set up the internal
state of the program for it ‒ configuration contains the ports to listen to,
etc, and it manages spawning the HTTP server objects inside the program and can
even migrate from one set of ports to other at runtime.</p>

<p>But migrating <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> to newer <code>tokio</code> and <code>hyper</code> was a big task (because
the API surface is quite large, the library does a bit unusual things compared
to all the usual applications and the change between old and new <code>tokio</code> was
quite large).</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually I got permission to work on the migration of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> as
part of my job. It took about a week to migrate both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> and <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It
went through review, went through the automatic tests and we put it to the
staging environment for a while, watching the logs and graphs. Everything seemed
fine, so after few days of everything looking fine, we pushed the button and put
it to production.</p>

<h2 id="the-increased-latencies">The increased latencies</h2>

<p>As it goes in these kinds of stories, by now you’re expecting to see what went
wrong.</p>

<p>The thing is, our own metrics and graphs were fine. But the latency on the
downstream service querying us increased by 40ms. The deployment got reverted,
and we started to dig into where these latencies come from.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-acting-really-weird">It was acting really weird</h2>

<p>There were several very suspicious things about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our own „internal“ latencies stayed the same. Our CPU usage also stayed the
same.</li>
  <li>The latency graph on the downstream side was flat 40ms <em>constant</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we introduced some performance regression in the query handling, we
would expect our CPU consumption to rise. We would also expect the latency graph
to be a bit spiky, not completely flat 40ms constant. It almost looked like
there was a 40ms <code>sleep</code> somewhere. But why would anyone put a 40ms sleep
anywhere?</p>

<p>I’ve looked through documentation and didn’t see anything obvious. I’ve tried
searching both our code and code of the dependencies for <code>40</code>, asked on Slack if
that <code>40ms</code> value was familiar to anyone. Nothing.</p>

<p>The working theory we started with was that there could be some kind of back-off
sleep on some kind of failure. Maybe <code>hyper</code> would be closing inactive
connections in the new version, forcing the application to reconnect (the graph
was for 99th percentile, so if we happened to close each 100th connection and
reconnection took this long…) and maybe try IPv6 first and we would be listening
on IPv4 only or… (in other words, we didn’t have a clear clue).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmarks">The benchmarks</h2>

<p>My colleague started to investigate in a more thorough way than just throwing
ideas around on Slack. He run a <code>wrk</code> benchmark against the service. On his
machine, the latencies were fine. So he commandeered one of the stage nodes to
play with it and run the benchmark there. And every request had 40ms latency on
that machine. The previous version of <code>urlite</code> was fine, with under one
millisecond.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was probably sleeping somewhere on the production servers, but not
on the development machine. There probably was some difference in the OS
settings, but definitely difference in the kernel version. The servers are
running some well-tried Linux distribution, so they have a lot older version,
while a developer is likely to run something much more on the edge.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>

<p>The selling point of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> is that most of the thing one can set in the
builders of various libraries and types now can be just put into a config file
without any recompilation. If we did configuration by hand, we would expose only
the things we thought would be useful, but with spirit, there’s everything. So,
naturally, tweaking some of the config knobs was the next step (because it was
easy to do).</p>

<p>It was discovered that turning the <code>http1-writev</code> option <em>off</em>, which
corresponds to
<a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.8/hyper/server/struct.Builder.html#method.http1_writev">this method</a>
in <code>hyper</code>, made the latencies go away.</p>

<p>We now had a solution, but I wasn’t happy about not understanding <em>why</em> that
helped, so I went to dig the rabbit hole and find the root cause. Turns out
there were several little things in just the constellation to make the problem
manifest.</p>

<h2 id="overriding-the-defaults-of-http1_writev">Overriding the defaults of <code>http1_writev</code></h2>

<p>The method controls the strategy in which way data are pushed into the socket.
With vectored writes enabled, it sends two separate buffers (one with headers,
the other with the body if it’s small enough) through a single <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a>
syscall.  If they are disabled, <code>hyper</code> copies all the bytes into a single
buffer and sends that as a whole.</p>

<p>It turns out that the method takes a <code>bool</code>, but there are actually 3 states.
The third (auto) is signalled by <em>not</em> calling the method and <code>spirit-hyper</code> was
calling it always, with the default to turn the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a> on. I don’t know if
leaving it on auto would make the bug go away, but I’ve fixed the problem in the
library anyway.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-vectored-writes">Splitting vectored writes</h2>

<p>Spirit wants to support a bit of configuration on top of what the underlying
libraries provide on their own. One of such things is limiting the number of
concurrently accepted connections on a single listening socket. Users don’t have
to take advantage of that (the types for the configuration can be composed
together to either contain that bit or not and the administrator may leave the
values for the limits unset in the configuration and then they won’t be
enforced).</p>

<p>Anyway, in case the support for the limits is opted in through using the type
with the configuration fields, the connections themselves are wrapped in a
<a href="https://docs.rs/spirit-tokio/0.7.*/spirit_tokio/net/limits/struct.Tracked.html"><code>Tracked</code></a>
type. The type tries to be mostly transparent for use and can be used inside
<code>hyper</code> (which is what the default configuration type alias in <code>spirit-hyper</code>
does), but tracks how many connections there are, to not accept more if it runs
out of the limit.</p>

<p>When implementing the bunch of traits for the wrapper, I’ve overlooked the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.*/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html#method.poll_write_buf"><code>AsyncWrite::poll_write_buff</code></a>.
It is a provided method, which means it has a default implementation. It is the
one that abstracts the OS-level <code>writev</code>, it can write multiple buffers (the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/0.5.*/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> represents a
segmented buffer).</p>

<p>The default implementation simply delegates to multiple calls to the ordinary
write. Therefore, this omission combined with the default of enabling vectored
writes results in calling into the kernel twice, each time with a small buffer,
instead of once with two small buffers or once with a big buffer.</p>

<p>That was definitely something to get fixed, because if nothing else, syscalls
are expensive and calling more of them is not great. But I’ve finally felt like
I’m on the right path, because:</p>

<h2 id="nagles-algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</h2>

<p>You probably know that TCP stream is built from packets going there and back.
Optimizing how to split the stream into the packets and when to send them is a
hard problem and the research in that area is still ongoing, because there are
many conflicting requirements. One wants to deliver the data with low latency,
utilize the whole bandwidth, but not overflow the capacity of the link (in which
case the latencies would go up or packets would get lost and would have to be
retransmitted), leave some bandwidth to other connections, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</a> is
one of the older tricks up in TCP’s sleeve. The network doesn’t like small
packets.  It is better to send as large packets as the link allows, because each
packet has certain overhead ‒ the headers that take some space, but also routers
spend computation power mostly based on number of packets and less on their
size. If you start sending a lot of tiny packets, the performance will suffer.
While the links are limited by the number of bytes that can pass through them,
routers are more limited by the number of packets. If a router declares to be
able to handle a gigabit connection, it actually means a gigabit <em>if you use
full-sized packets</em>, but will get to few megabits if you split the data into
tiny packets.</p>

<p>So it would be better to wait until the send buffer contains a packetfull of
data before sending anything. But we can’t do that, because we don’t <em>know</em>
there’ll ever be a full packet of data, or generating more data might wait for
the other side to answer. We would never send anything and wait forever and the
Internet would not work.</p>

<p>Instead, the algorithm is willing to send <em>one</em> undersized packet and then it
waits for an <code>ACK</code> from the other side until sending another undersized one. If
it gets a packetfull of data to send in the meantime, that’s great and it sends
it (it won’t get better by waiting longer), but it won’t ever have two
undersized ones somewhere in flight, therefore won’t kill the network’s
performance by them.</p>

<p>This works, it’ll make progress eventually because once the <code>ACK</code> comes and
all the data that accumulated until then is sent.</p>

<p>But it also slows things down. Like in our case. What happens if we do it using
single syscall, the whole HTTP response forms a single undersized packet (we
have really small answers) and gets sent, no matter if it’s submitted to the
kernel by one big or two small buffers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we split the submission into two syscalls, this is what
happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We write the first part (headers). The kernel sends them out as an undersized
packet.</li>
  <li>We write the second part (the body). But the kernel shelves them into the send
buffer and waits for sending them until it sees the <code>ACK</code>, because there’s one
undersized packet …</li></ul></section></div></div>

              <p>Here’s the reality, billions of credentials have been leaked or stolen and are now easily downloaded online by anyone. Many of these databases of identities include passwords in plain text, while others are one-way hashed. One-way hashing is better (we’ll get to why in a second), but it is only as secure as is mathematically feasible. Let’s take a look at one-way hashing algorithms and how computers handle them.</p>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<p>A hash by definition is a function that can map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. SHA2 is a hashing algorithm that uses various bit-wise operations on any number of bytes to produce a fixed sized hash. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256 bit result. The algorithm was designed specifically so that going from a hash back to the original bytes is infeasible. Developers use an SHA2 hash so that instead of storing a plain text password, they instead only store the hash. When a user is authenticated, the plain text password they type into the login form is hashed, and because the algorithm will always produce the same hash result given the same input, comparing this hash to the hash in the database tells us the password is correct.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-passwords">Cracking Passwords</h2>

<p>While one-way hashing means we aren’t storing plain text passwords, it is still possible to determine the original plain text password from a hash. Next, we’ll outline the two most common approaches of reversing a hash.</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>

<p>The first is called a lookup table, or sometimes referred to as a rainbow table. This method builds a massive lookup table that maps hashes to plain text passwords. The table is built by simply hashing every possible password combination and storing it in some type of database or data-structure that allows for quick lookups.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lookup table for SHA2 hashed passwords:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sha2_hash                                                          password</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a lookup table, all the attacker needs to know is the SHA2 hash of the password and they can see if it exists in the table. For example, let’s assume for a moment that Netflix stores your password using an SHA2 hash. If Netflix is breached, their user database is likely now available to anyone with a good internet connection and a torrent client. Even a mediocre hacker now only needs to lookup the SHA2 hash associated with your Netflix account to see if it exists in their lookup table. This will reveal nearly instantly what your plain text password is for Netflix. Now, this hacker can log in to your Netflix account and binge watch all four seasons of Fuller House (“how rude!”). And he can also try this password on Hulu and HBO Go to see if you used the same email address and password for those accounts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/salt.png" alt="Salt"></p>

<p>The best way to protect against this type of attack is to use what is called a <strong>salt</strong>. A salt is simply a bunch of random characters that you prepend to the password before it is hashed. Each password should have a different salt, which means that a lookup table is unlikely to have an entry for the combination of the salt and the password. This makes salts an ideal defense against lookup tables.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a salt and the resulting combination of the password and the salt which is then hashed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Bad, no salt. Very bland.</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>"password"</span><span>)</span> <span>// 6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e</span>

<span>// Better, add a salt.</span>
<span>salt</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3a"</span>
<span>toHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword"</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>toHash</span><span>)</span> <span>// f534e6bf84a638112e07e69861927ab624c0217c0655e4d3be07659bcf6c1c07</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have added the salt, the “password” that we actually generated the hash from was the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>. This String is long, complex and contains a lot of random characters. Therefore, it is nearly impossible that the hacker that created the lookup table would have generated the hash for the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/hulk.png" alt="Brute Force"></p>

<p>The second method that attackers use to crack passwords is called brute force cracking. This means that the attacker writes a computer program that can generate all possible combinations of characters that can be used for a password and then computes the hash for each combination. This program can also take a salt if the password was hashed with a salt. The attacker then runs the program until it generates a hash that is the same as the hash from the database. Here’s a simple Java program for cracking passwords. We left out some detail to keep the code short (such as all the possible password characters), but you get the idea.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program will generate all the possible passwords with lengths between 6 and 8 characters and then hash each one until it finds a match. This type of brute-force hacking takes time because of the number of possible combinations.</p>

<h2 id="password-complexity-vs-computational-power">Password complexity vs. computational power</h2>

<p>Let’s bust out our TI-85 calculators and see if we can figure out how long this program will take to run. For this example we will assume the passwords can only contain ASCII characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation). This set is roughly 100 characters (this is rounded up to make the math easier to read). If we know that there are at least 6 characters and at most 8 characters in a password, then all the possible combinations can be represented by this expression:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result of this expression is equal to <code>10,101,000,000,000,000</code>. This is quite a large number, North of 10 quadrillion to be a little more precise, but what does it actually mean when it comes to our cracking program? This depends on the speed of the computer the cracking program is running on and how long it takes the computer to execute the SHA2 algorithm. The algorithm is the key component here because the rest of the program is extremely fast at creating the passwords.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get dicey. If you run a quick Google search for <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fastest+bitcoin+rig">“fastest bitcoin rig”</a> you’ll see that these machines are rated in terms of the number of hashes they can perform per second. The bigger ones can be rated as high as <code>44 TH/s</code>. That means it can generate 44 tera-hashes per second or <code>44,000,000,000,000</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if we divide the total number of passwords by the number of hashes we can generate per second, we are left with the total time it takes a Bitcoin rig to generate the hashes for all possible passwords. In our example above, this equates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.0101e16

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = ~230
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that using this example Bitcoin rig, we could generate all the hashes for a password between 6 and 8 characters in length in roughly 4 minutes. Feeling nervous yet? Let’s add one additional character and see long it takes to hash all possible passwords between 6 and 9 characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^9 + 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.010101E18

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 22,956
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~383
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = ~6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By adding one additional character to the potential length of the password we increased the total compute time from 4 minutes to 6 hours. This is nearing a 100x increase in computational time to use the brute force strategy. You probably can see where this is going. To defeat the brute force strategy, you simply need to make it improbable to calculate all possible password combinations.</p>

<p>Let’s get crazy and make a jump to 16 characters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^16 + 100^15 ... 100^7 + 100^6 = 1e32

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 2.27e18
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = 3.78e16
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = 630,000,000,000,000 or 630 trillion
numberOfDays = numberOfHours / 24 = 26,250,000,000,000 or 26.25 trillion days
numberOfYears = numberOfDays / 365 = 71,917,808,219 or 71.9 billion years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To boil down our results, if we take these expressions and simplify them, we can build an equation that solves for any length password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>numberOfSeconds = 100^lengthOfPassword / computeSpeed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This equation shows that as the password length increases, …</p></div></div>

<p>
As it tends to do, time continues to move on.  The project and code in
it eventually becomes legacy code (aka, someone else's problem to
maintain).
</p>

<p>
One day, the business drudges up that old automated cookie creation
idea and requests that it handles a new task - "instead of just cooking
peanut butter cookies, it'd be great if the cookie system could handle
oatmeal raisin as well!".
</p>

<p>
Hah!  You remember that old system, but you're onto newer and better
things.  This is a perfect task for the intern to sink their teeth
into - afterall, it's legacy and not high profile, it's been stable,
and it was so simple to implement the first time around.
</p>

<p>
The new set of requirements/recipe the intern works off of looks very
similar to the initial ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 325F, grease cookie sheet</li>
<li>Step 2: In bowl, stir oats, pumpkin puree and sugar until smooth.</li>
<li>Step 3: Beat in one egg white, then stir in baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Step 4: Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.</li>
<li>Step 5: Bake for 8 minutes, cool for 5, enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<p>
He eagerly begins to expand the original code to handle the new case:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>function</span> <span>makeCookies</span> <span>(</span><span>type</span> = <span>'peanut-butter'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  sheet.cool<span>(</span>5<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> cookies
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The code comes in, the peer reviews pass it as it meets the
requirements and nothing is obviously wrong.  Still, it has become a
bit harder to understand and you're left with a nagging feeling.

                <h2><b>Armory, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes</b></h2>
<p><span>We are excited to announce that Armory now provides a K8s-native continuous delivery experience from end-to-end, unlocking Kubernetes deployments in the enterprise at massive scale. As a cloud-native, multi-cloud CD platform, Spinnaker has always been a powerful tool for deploying to Kubernetes. In fact, AWS and Google engineering teams helped to build the </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/deep-dive-into-clouddriver/"><span>Spinnaker Clouddrivers</span></a><span> for deploying to EKS and GKE, and Spinnaker powers more than </span><b>8 million monthly K8s deployments</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png" alt="" width="631" height="337" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png"></p>
<p><em>Monthly OSS Spinnaker deployments to K8s are up 5x since April.</em></p>
<p><span>Armory is enhancing Spinnaker by introducing a familiar Kubernetes workflow, eliminating context-switching and domain-specific languages, and helping Spinnaker scale deployments to thousands of Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>
<h2><b>Day 0: The Armory Operator</b></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/announcing-the-spinnaker-kubernetes-operator/"><span>Armory Operator</span></a><span> is a Kubernetes operator for implementing and managing Spinnaker, bringing a Kubernetes-native GitOps workflow to managing Spinnaker’s full lifecycle. With the Operator, you treat Spinnaker as simply another Kubernetes deployment, installing, managing, and upgrading it with familiar tools such as <code>kubectl</code> and <code>kustomize</code>. Install Spinnaker with just a few keystrokes, and upgrade your Spinnaker version simply by changing the version number in a config file and applying. Access to other Kubernetes features, such as Kubernetes Secrets, also comes enabled out of the box.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator also unlocks the scalability and security of a GitOps workflow by defining all of your Spinnaker configs as code and centralizing them in a single Git repo. This enables collaborative code reviews on all config changes to ensure that Spinnaker is stable and secure. Pre-flight validation of all changes adds a further layer of safety. In the event of a bad update, built-in config version control allows for rapid rollbacks and auditability.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator is available for both Armory and open source Spinnaker.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building your Deployment Pipelines: PaCRD</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/spinnaker-user-guides/pacrd/"><span>PaCRD</span></a><span> (a combination of “</span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/pipelines-as-code-gitops/"><span>Pipelines as Code</span></a><span>” and “</span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/"><span>Custom Resource Definition</span></a><span>”) is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of Spinnaker applications and pipelines as objects within your K8s cluster. PaCRD extends Kubernetes functionality to support Spinnaker Application and Pipeline objects that can be observed for changes through a mature lifecycle management API.</span></p>
<p><span>With PaCRD you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Maintain your Spinnaker pipelines as code with the rest of your Kubernetes manifests.</span></li>
<li><span>Persist Pipeline and Application changes with confidence to your Spinnaker cluster.</span></li>
<li><span>Leverage existing tools <code>helm</code> and <code>kustomize</code> to template your pipelines across teams and projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Pipelines as Code is one of Armory’s most powerful features. It brings security and repeatability to your application deployments by enabling you to templatize and share pre-blessed pipelines that are up-to-date with your organizational best practices and security &amp; compliance policies. With PaCRD, we are providing another method for accessing those benefits, but with a K8s-native workflow and some additional Kubernetes functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>PaCRD is available as an early release feature with select </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-design-partners/"><span>Armory Design Partners</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Deployment to Production: The Armory Agent for Kubernetes&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>Spinnaker is the tool of choice for hundreds of the world’s leading enterprises to deploy to Kubernetes. The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/armory-agent-for-kubernetes/"><span>Armory Agent for Kubernetes</span></a><span> adds further scalability and security to Kubernetes deployments on Spinnaker, unlocking enterprise use cases at the highest scale as you expand your Kubernetes footprint. With the Agent, you can deploy to thousands of Kubernetes clusters as easily as you deploy to two.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Agent acts as a highly performant and efficient Kubernetes controller on behalf of Spinnaker’s Clouddriver service. Its distributed, optimized caching model eliminates latency and accelerates pipeline execution times, while its decentralized account management design enhances security and enables individual teams to manage permissions for their specific clusters. These security and account management features are also enabling </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud/"><span>Armory Cloud</span></a><span>, a SaaS version of the Armory Platform that is currently in early release (request early access </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud-signup/"><span>here</span></a><span>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png" alt="" width="591" height="368" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-1024x637.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-360x224.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM.png 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png"></p>

If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>. But for us, this process has brought to light an unintended consequence of this 99 investor limit.</p><p>Over time, successful venture firms raise larger and larger funds, quickly running into the 99 investor limit, and forcing their investment minimum higher. <strong>These high minimums concentrate this wealth creation opportunity to super high net worth individuals and institutional investors, excluding accredited investors who cannot afford to write such a large check.</strong></p><p>The SEC enforces certain kinds of regulations to provide investor protections against fraud and abuse, which we salute. However, current regulations (and this 99 investor limit) prohibit the average accredited investor from accessing these markets in a meaningful way. This matters because the private markets are a significant driver of wealth creation.</p><p>We fully understand that the SEC needs to have some limit on the number of investors that can invest in a private fund. <strong>However, we believe that the current limit of 99 is the wrong approach.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We started TinySeed because we wanted to give founders more options for capital to grow their companies, and we feel that as a fund, we can and should also call for change in how sophisticated investors are able to invest their money.<strong><em> </em></strong>Specifically, we believe that successful tech founders and operators should be able to invest into the field they understand best — early stage technology — instead of being limited to real estate or the public markets.</p><p>We believe funds like ours should be able admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are accredited.</p><h3>As the current rules are enshrined in law, we’re exploring ways to bring this issue in front of Congress. <strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><p>Fund regulations and SEC rules are fairly complicated; read on for our breakdown of what everything means below:<br></p><h2>Current SEC regulatory regime for private funds</h2><h3>3(c)(1) vs. 3(c)(7)</h3><p>The SEC’s regulatory regime currently provides 2 exemptions to the (burdensome and expensive) requirement for a venture fund like ours to be registered with the SEC: 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7).</p><p>A 3(c)(1) fund may have no more than 99 Accredited Investors, while a 3(c)(7) fund can have up to 1999 investors, but these must all be “Qualified Purchasers”. The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Tecton is becoming a core contributor to the <a href="http://feast.dev/">Feast</a> open source feature store, and that Willem Pienaar, creator of Feast, is joining the Tecton team. In other words, we’re strong believers in the Feast project and are investing meaningful resources into its success. We share a joint vision with Willem: enable every organization to operationalize ML at scale by allowing teams to build and deploy features quickly and reliably.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following Tecton, you know that we’re also building our own commercial feature store that’s currently in early access and soon-to-become Generally Available. And this naturally raises a few questions: why invest in two feature stores, and what does this mean for both Feast and the Tecton feature store?</p>







<h2>Making Feature Stores Accessible to Every Organization</h2>



<p>We believe that feature stores are an essential part of the modern ML stack because they solve the hardest problem of productionizing operational ML: getting fresh feature data reliably computed and served into production. As discussed in <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">“What is a Feature Store?”</a>, a feature store solves this problem by managing feature transformation pipelines, storing features, and serving features in production. The Tecton founding team saw the need for a feature store at Uber where we built the Michelangelo project. Similarly, other technology companies like Gojek also realized the importance of feature stores, leading to the development of Feast.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, feature stores have up to now been accessible only to the largest, most sophisticated technology companies that have the skills and resources to build their own infrastructure.</p>



<p>For the rest of the industry, this technology has remained mostly out of reach. Building your own feature store requires dedicated teams of highly skilled engineers and multiple years of development time. Our objective is to change this, and to put feature stores in reach of every organization, regardless of their ML maturity and available commercial resources.</p>







<h2>Freedom to Choose Between Open Source and Commercial Software</h2>



<p>We have seen strong demand for teams to enter the early access program we introduced earlier this year. We’ve partnered with customers ranging from small growth-stage startups to large Fortune 50 companies, across North America and Europe. We now have customers like <a href="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Atlassian-Case-Study-201006.pdf">Atlassian</a> running at production scale on the Tecton enterprise feature store.</p>



<p>Along the way, we’ve learned that user needs vary significantly based on their level of maturity, size, and resources. Cloud services are preferred by larger teams that are operationalizing ML at scale and need to move fast, offload the burden of managing and updating software, and have guaranteed service levels with enterprise support. On the other hand, open source is highly valued by small ML teams that are just starting out and want to get their hands dirty, and by large organizations that need to customize the software to their specific needs and have the resources and skills to self-manage their ML infrastructure.</p>



<p>Our objective at Tecton is to solve the data problem for Operational ML for all organizations. The Tecton enterprise feature store is only available as a managed cloud service, leaving a gap for organizations that need open source software today. To close the gap, we decided to put significant resources behind Feast. Partnering with the Feast project, our plan is to leverage our existing development efforts in and learnings from Tecton to help make Feast the best open source feature store, both for small teams just starting out and for larger teams that need the flexibility of open source. As strong allies, we’re going to advance the state of the art for feature stores and enable their adoption across the industry.</p>







<h2>Feast: The Leading Open Source Feature Store</h2>



<p>Feast was developed jointly by Gojek and Google Cloud, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-feast-an-open-source-feature-store-for-machine-learning">first announced</a> about two years ago. Since its initial release in 2019, Feast has grown rapidly, with multiple companies, including Microsoft, Agoda, Farfetch, Postmates and Zulily adopting and/or contributing to the project. Today, the project has more than 1,100 GitHub stars and has been adopted as a <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/feature-store/">component in Kubeflow</a>.</p>



<p>Willem and the Feast contributors have a clear <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/a-state-of-feast">vision</a> of where they want to take the project, and that vision is very well aligned with Tecton’s vision.</p>



<p>Feast will remain a completely independent project, <a href="https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2020/11/10/feast-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-incubation-project/">managed by the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation</a>. Willem will continue to be fully committed to Feast, and an official maintainer of the project. And of course, Feast continues to welcome new users and contributors. If you want to learn more or are looking to use Feast: please check out their resources and get involved!</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Deployment and Support</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast’s differences are most notable on how they’re deployed and managed: Feast is fully open source and self-managed. Tecton is a fully-managed cloud service and can be deployed into a company’s private VPC, or into a Tecton-provided single-tenant SaaS environment. While Feast got started on GCP and Tecton got started on AWS, both will support GCP, AWS and Azure in 2021.</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Capabilities</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast have independent roots and were started by different companies. Tecton’s capability set is largely a superset of Feast’s, with a strong focus on fully-fledged transformation support and enterprise capabilities:</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Feast-_-Tecton.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>

<h2>Offering a seamless migration between Tecton and Feast</h2>



<p>Often, the preferences between using a managed enterprise offering and a self-managed open source project change over time. An enterprise using Tecton’s managed offering may eventually require greater customizability and prefer to switch to a custom fork of Feast. Similarly, a small team that got started with Feast may eventually desire the enterprise capability and managed service of Tecton. To simplify transitions, Tecton is committed to providing a simple migration path between both projects. This migration path will eventually be enabled via:</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Feature Serving API Parity:</strong></strong> The feature serving APIs will be identical, allowing customers to switch between both feature stores without having to modify the feature store clients. Model training notebooks and prediction services running in production can remain largely unchanged as long as the client points at the new Feature Store backend.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Definition Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton’s feature definition DSL will be a superset of Feast’s DSL. As a result, Feast feature definitions can seamlessly be applied to a Tecton deployment.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Store Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton and Feast will support the same offline and online feature storage technologies (e.g. S3, Delta, DynamoDB, Redis etc.) and understand the same storage contract. As a result, no physical data will need to be migrated as customers choose to migrate between both projects.</li></ul>

This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>You’re a software testing engineer, working at a big tech company. While other
engineers on your team write code, your job is to make sure the code is safe
before you push it to production. Your goal isn’t to prove the code is
“correct,” but rather to assess the risk of potential failures to the company
and <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">test
accordingly</a>.
You mainly write tests that try to rule out known or suspected failure modes,
and you spend a lot of time thinking about edge cases.</p>

<p>One day, over your morning cup of coffee, you get an email from the other
engineers on your team. They’ve decided that writing source code is too hard, so
they’ve started <strong>randomly guessing</strong> program implementations until one meets
the specification. They call this wacky approach “<a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software
2.0</a>” or something.</p>

<p>“Not to worry,” they tell you, “we can prove it works. You don’t even have to
write tests any more!” They go on to explain that there’s this book called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory#:~:text=Statistical%20learning%20theory%20is%20a,predictive%20function%20based%20on%20data.">Statistical Learning
Theory</a>,”
which describes a mathematical framework that <em>proves</em> Software 2.0 can give you
a correct implementation.</p>

<p>Intrigued, you ask them for more details.</p>



<p>First, they have to assume that any future user input will be similar to what
you’ve seen previously in production. They call this the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">IID</a>
assumption.</p>

<p>“But what about hackers?” you ask. “and what happens when we change the UI?
People change their behaviour all the time! This week they’re Googling for
election results, but next week they’ll go back to Googling Kanye West…”</p>

<p>They concede that maybe you have a point, but they definitely
need this assumption to make it work. You begrudgingly let them continue.</p>



<p>Then they tell you there’s no specification. You ask them what the hell that means.</p>

<p>“Ok, hear us out,” they say. “The old spec was basically impossible to write.
There were too many edge cases! Our poor product manager didn’t even know where
to start, honestly.”</p>

<p>Instead, they decided to ask the product manager to write down a bunch of
example user inputs along with the correct output for each example. That would
serve as the defacto specification. They call this “training data.” Then they
guess a program that meets those requirements, using this thing called gradient
descent.</p>

<p>You mention that this reminds you of <a href="https://medium.com/dev-genius/dont-just-test-the-happy-path-e3fd565bad53">happy-path
testing</a>,
where you only write tests for things you expect without thinking about possible
failure modes. In this case the training examples test the happy paths. How do
you know there aren’t still edge cases and bugs lurking around?</p>

<p>That’s where the magic of STL kicks in, they say.</p>



<p>If you assume that future inputs look like past inputs, they say, then you can
also assume future performance will look like past performance! As long as you
<strong>have enough training data</strong>, there’s a low probability that you’ll encounter
edge cases. Basically, you want the happy paths to be the only paths.</p>

<p>“But how many examples do you need to make sure there aren’t any unhappy paths?”
you ask.</p>

<p>It depends on how complicated the program you’re guessing is, they say. If the
program is super complex and you don’t know anything about it, you basically
need to enumerate all the possible inputs. They’ve been calling this the “<a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/what-are-the-no-free-lunch-theorems-in-data-science/">No
Free Lunch Theorem</a>.”</p>

<p>But if it’s “simple” somehow and you can use that to narrow down the possible
candidate programs, then you need way less data. That part sounds kind of
reasonable to you. It reminds you of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">branch
coverage</a> when writing unit tests.
If you have more branches, then you have to write more tests. Similarly, if you
have more possible candidate programs, then you need more data to make sure you
pick the right one.</p>



<p>“But wait,” you say, “what if you’re wrong about how the program you’re guessing
is simple? Isn’t the problem that you don’t know the right program in the
first place?”</p>

<p>They tell you you’re right, of course, and that there’s a trade-off. There are
different kinds of simplicity with different levels of strictness.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> If you
suppose the wrong kind of simplicity from the start, that puts a hard cap on how
well you can learn the program. They call this the <em>bias</em> or <em>approximation
error</em>. On the other hand, if you don’t assume anything at all, then you need
way more data. If you don’t have enough, then you might encounter <em>variance</em> or
<em>estimation error</em>.</p>

<p>The best case, of course, is when you don’t have to guess and you know the
correct implementation of the program you want to write. Then you would have
maximum correct bias and no variance.</p>

<p>You muse that the second best case would be to just label every possible input
so that you don’t have to assume anything. They tell you that’s usually impractical (the
poor product manager can only work so much) but in some cases you basically have
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">infinite data</a> and that’s exactly what they do.</p>



<p>“So let me get this straight,” you say.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, you assume that the future will look like the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, you get somebody to write down a bunch of example inputs and
correct outputs which you use as the spec.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, you make some assumptions about the program you’re trying to guess. If
you make the wrong assumptions, then you cap your maximum performance. But if
you don’t make any, you might accidentally overload your product manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you guess a random program that fits the spec. As long as
you have enough data, you can guarantee you did the best you could with your
assumptions and that you probably won’t hit any edge cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They nod. You shake your head. “I don’t know guys, this seems kind of fishy. The
IID assumption is one thing, but we also have no idea how much the approximation error is, right?”</p>

<p>They shrug. “Look man, we just don’t want to write any code, ok? It’s too hard.”
You can understand the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Besides, we don’t ever really use STL in practice.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, we just set aside some of the training data as a test set. If the program
we guess does good on the training data and the test set, we just assume it’s
good to go.”</p>

<p>“But what if your test set is bad?”</p>

<p>They shrug again. “We just do our best. Sometimes we <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.442/">craft test
sets</a> that look for
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12598">specific properties</a>.”</p>

<p>You nod knowingly. At the end of the day, you don’t write tests to prove
correctness. You write tests to show the <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">presence or absence of
bugs</a>
in a way that appropriately manages risk. Some things never change. You take a
sip of coffee and go back to writing unit tests, suspecting your colleagues
will join you in a few years.</p>

<p>American bakery company <em>sweetly</em> remembered for its late-night warm cookie trucks across college campuses was caught leaking sensitive data on its website.</p>



<p>The data exposed via public <code>.env</code> files included production server database credentials, including the DB server addresses, ports, usernames, passwords, and API keys.</p>



<p><code>.env</code> files contain sensitive configuration data such as environment variables, API keys, passwords, and are supposed to remain private, hidden from prying eyes of the public.</p>



<p>The exposed <em>.env</em> file provided enough information for an attacker to potentially be able to access the Insomnia Cookies database and carry all sorts of attacks, such as dropping entire databases, or illicitly obtaining the information contained within them, such as customer data.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnC8cEWXEAE2PfB?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Image"><figcaption>Source: Bob Diachenko </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bob Diachenko, Cyber Threat Intelligence researcher who discovered the flaw on November 12th via public IoT search engines (such as Shodan), responsibly reported it to Insomnia Cookies.</p>



<p>However, Diachenko didn’t receive a response. And it seems, Insomnia Cookies quietly patched the flaw following Diachenko’s report.</p>



<p>“Insomnia Cookies left almost all of their prod credentials exposed via publicly accessible dot-env file on one of its IPs (indexed by all IoT search engines). Silently secured after responsible disclosure, no response,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MayhemDayOne/status/1328769354318688257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> Diachenko.</p>



<p>Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em> he had discovered the data leak last week via public IoT search engines and immediately reported it to Insomnia Cookies:</p>



<p>“I discovered that one on Nov 12th and immediately sent alert to IC.”</p>



<p>“Basically, dot-env is environment variables file for internal usage only. Developers define here settings for databases and endpoints so if you have this, most of the company’s infrastructure is compromised,” Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em>.</p>



<p>When building and publishing websites to production environment, it may be wise to check file permissions, to prevent data leaks such as this one.</p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> has reached out to Insomnia Cookies for comment but haven’t heard back yet.</p>

  <p>In this article I will share my opinion about things I like in
OpenBSD, this may including a short rant about recent open source
practices not helping non-linux support.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>There is no telemetry on OpenBSD. It’s good for privacy, there is
nothing to turn off to disable reporting information.</p>

<p>The default system settings will prevent microphone to record sound
and the webcam can’t be accessed without user consent because the
device is root’s by default.</p>

<h3 id="securefirefoxchromium">Secure firefox / chromium</h3>

<p>While the security features added to the market dominating web
browsers <strong>can be cumbersome sometimes</strong>, this is really a game
changer compared to others systems. The web browsers should be able to
only retrieve files in a few user defined directories, like
<code>~/Downloads</code> or <code>/tmp/</code> by default and some others directories
required for the browsers to work.</p>

<p>This means your <code>~/.ssh</code>, <code>~/Documents</code> and everything else can’t be
read by an exploit in a web browser.</p>

<p>It’s possible to replicate this on Linux using AppArmor, but it’s
absolutely not out of the box and requires a lot of tweaks from the
user to get an usable Firefox. I did try, it worked but it requires a
very good understanding of the Firefox needs and AppArmor profile
syntax to get it to work.</p>

<h3 id="pffirewall">PF firewall</h3>

<p>With this firewall, I can quickly check the rules of my desktop or
server and understand what they are doing.</p>

<p>I also use a lot the bandwidth management feature to throttle the
bandwidth some programs can use which doesn’t provide any rate
limiting. This is very important to me. Linux users could use the
software <code>trickle</code> for this.</p>

<h3 id="itsstable">It’s stable</h3>

<p>Apart from the use of some funky hardware, OpenBSD has proven me being
very stable and reliable. I can easily reach two weeks of uptime on my
desktop with a few suspend/resume every day. My servers are running
24/7 without incident for years.</p>

<p>I rarely go further than two weeks on my workstation because I run
current and this means it’s time to upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="lowmaintenance">Low maintenance</h3>

<p>Keeping my OpenBSD up-to-date is very easy. I run syspatch and pkg_add
-u twice a day to keep the system up to date. A release every six
months requires a bit of work.</p>

<p>Basically, upgrading every six months looks like this, except some
specific instructions explained in the upgrade guide (database server
major upgrade for example):</p>

<pre><code># sysupgrade
[..wait..]
# pkg_add -u
# reboot
</code></pre>

<h3 id="documentationisaccurate">Documentation is accurate</h3>

<p>Setting up an OpenBSD system with full disk encryption is easy.</p>

<p>Documentation to create a router with NAT is explained step by step.</p>

<p>Every binary or configuration file have their own up-to-date man page.</p>

<p>The FAQ, the website and the man pages should contain everything one
needs. This represents a lot of information, it may not be easy to
find what you need, but it’s there.</p>

<p>If I had to be without internet for some times, I would prefer an
OpenBSD system. The embedded documentation (man pages) should help me
to achieve what I want.</p>

<p>Consider configuring a router with traffic shaping on OpenBSD and
another one with Linux without Internet access. I’d 100% prefer read
the PF man page.</p>

<h3 id="contributingiseasy">Contributing is easy</h3>

<p>This has been a hot topic recently. I very enjoy the way OpenBSD
manage the contributions. I download the sources on my system,
anywhere I want, modify it, generate a diff and I send it on the
mailing list. All of this can be done from a console with tools I
already use (git/cvs) and email.</p>

<p>There could be an entry barrier for new contributors: you may feel
people replying are not kind with you. <strong>This is not true.</strong> If you
sent a diff and received critics (reviews) of your code, this means
some people spent time to teach you how to improve your work. I do
understand some people may feel it rude, but it’s not.</p>

<p>This year I modestly contributed to the projects
<a href="https://www.openindiana.org/">OpenIndiana</a> and
<a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, this was the opportunity to compare how
contributions are handled. Both those projects use github. The
work flow is interesting but understanding it and mastering it is
extremely complicated.</p>

<p>One has to make a github account, fork the project, create a branch,
make the changes for your contribution, commit locally, push on the
fork, use the github interface to do a merge request. This is only the
short story. On NixOS, my first attempt ended in a pull request
involving 6 months of old commits. With good documentation and
training, this could be overcome, and I think this method has some
advantages like easy continuous integration of the commits and easy
review of code, but it’s a real entry barrier for new people.</p>

<h3 id="highqualitypackages">High quality packages</h3>

<p>My opinion may be biased on this (even more than for the previous
items), but I really think OpenBSD packages quality is very high. Most
packages should work out of the box with sane defaults.</p>

<p>Packages requiring specific instructions have a README file installed
with them explaining how to setup the service or the quirks that could
happen.</p>

<p>Even if we lack some packages due to lack of contributors and time (in
addition to some packages relying too much on Linux to be easy to
port), major packages are up to date and working very well.</p>

<p>I will take the opportunity of this article to publish a complaint
toward the general trend in the Open Source.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>programs distributed only using flatpak / docker / snap are really
 Linux friendly but this is hostile to non Linux systems. They often
 make use of linux-only features and the builds systems are made for
 the linux distribution methods.</p></li>
<li><p>nodeJS programs: they are made out of hundreds or even thousands of
 libraries often working fragile even on Linux. This is a real pain
 to get them working on OpenBSD. Some node libraries embed rust
 programs, some will download a static binary and use it with no
 fallback solution or will even try to compile source code instead of
 using that library/binary from the system when installed.</p></li>
<li><p>programs using git to build: our build process makes its best to be
 clean, the dedicated build user *<em>HAS NO NETWORK ACCESS</em> and won’t
 run those git commands. There are no reasons a build system has to
 run git to download sources in the middle of the build.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do understand that the three items above exist because it is easy
for developers. But if you write software and publish it, that would
be very kind of you to think how it works on non-linux systems. Don’t
hesitate to ask on social medias if someone is willing to build your
software on a different platform than yours if you want to improve
support. We do love BSD friendly developers who won’t reject OpenBSD
specifics patches.</p>

<h3 id="whatiwouldliketoseeimproved">What I would like to see improved</h3>

<p>This is my own opinion and doesn’t represent the OpenBSD team members
opinions. There are some things I wish OpenBSD could improve there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sndiod support for separates in/out devices (I have an usb
 microphone and an usb DAC and I can’t use them for audio conference)
 (<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=160562971904202&amp;w=2">a patch</a>
 was sent the next after this article was published)</li>
<li>Better ARM support</li>
<li>Wifi speed</li>
<li>Better performance (gently improving every release)</li>
<li>FFS improvements in regards to reliability (I often get files in
 lost+found)</li>
<li>Faster pkg_add -u</li>
<li>hardware video decoding/encoding support</li>
<li>better FUSE support and mount cifs/smb support</li>
<li>scaling up the contributions (more contributors and reviewers for
 ports@)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware of all the work required here, and I’m certainly not the
person who will improve those. This is not a complain but wishes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, everyone knows OpenBSD features come from hard work and
not from wishes submitted to the developers :)</p>

<p>When you think how little the team is in comparison to the other
majors OS, I really think a good and efficient job is done there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I was growing up using computers I was clueless about character sets. Mostly there were just US characters, and everyone converted the umlauts (Ä and Ö) and the A with the overring (Å) used in Finnish to their A, O and A equivalents. I guess you could call that transliteration, and we all did it&nbsp;because we had to. Technology evolved and we got more and more Äs, Ös and Ås in our digital lives. Everyone I knew was using Windows. Life was good. Then came the web and trouble started brewing.</p><div><p>I started my webmaster amateur career sometime in 1996. I still didn't know (or care) much about character sets, and the most common mistakes I made while learning was with images;&nbsp;I accidentally referred to them from my local C: drive or they were so large it would take a fortnight to load with my somewhat outdated 9.6k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Valley_Products" title="">GVC</a> modem.</p><p>It wasn't until my first "real job" in early 2000 when I got a glimpse of&nbsp;the horrors of character sets. At work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_director" title="">Art Directors</a>&nbsp;were using colorful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3" title="">Macintosh G3 tower computers</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9" title="">Mac OS 9</a> that didn't seem to run straight for more than a day. Even worse, sometimes they couldn't even display contemporary words like <a href="https://urbaanisanakirja.com/word/larvilautanen/" title="">lärvilautanen</a> or names like <a href="https://www.mikrobitti.fi/uutiset/jaakko-rytsola-oli-lamborghininsa-kanssa-it-kuplan-kasvot-menetti-miljoonat-ja-haluaa-nyt-opettaa-rahan-arvon-uudella-sovelluksella/dc23a929-db4d-4302-ab7d-3b5a8127d0ff" title="">Rytsölä</a> right. I&nbsp;snickered and crouched over the keyboard of my rock-solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT" title="">Windows NT</a> workstation to&nbsp;craft some fine artesan HTML with notepad.exe.</p><p>The early 2000s were an intense learning experience for me. I switched over from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad" title="">Microsoft Notepad</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@velmu/is-it-time-to-reconsider-dreamweaver-34d442e5c278" title="">Macromedia DreamWeaver</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite" title="">Allaire HomeSite</a>. My career peaked when I worked on&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001019003024/http://www.bomfunk.net/main_first.html" title="">the homepage for Bomfunk MCs</a>.&nbsp;I felt invincible. I ran into trouble with characters occasionally, but the "real developers" working with ASP or Java were always willing to help the front end developer greenhorn&nbsp;navigate the seas of broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana" title="">Verdana</a> on a manager's&nbsp;screen. Every so often I also had issues with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" title="">line breaks</a> too, but the bearded guy always helped me out. I think he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)" title="">Solaris</a>.</p><p>I didn't really start my hate-hate relationship with characters until around 2003. At twenty-three I was now a <em>Senior Developer</em>, and had stretched my wings to the server-side as well with mad LAMP&nbsp;skillz and setting up vhosts on Apache. I was, what you would now call&nbsp;a <em>Senior Fullstack Ninja</em>. Or that's how I saw myself. I was&nbsp;the person people came to get advice from, knee-deep in JavaScript, having innovated an <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/pdf/tarvainen_thesis-040428.pdf" title="">amazing client-side bug tracker</a>&nbsp;that would change how we work. Little did I know.</p><p>At this point I was also working on some projects for a well-known (at the time) Finnish mobile phone manufacturer in foreign languages like Hebrew&nbsp;and Hungarian. This is when it all started falling apart. In the past I had been able to solve issues with weird characters by poking them with a stick or the magical&nbsp;<em>charset=iso-8859-1</em>&nbsp;metatag. But things were gradually getting worse. I was increasingly unable to use HomeSite because the characters were garbled. After too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYv4yadRexY" title="">Jallu</a> shots, I&nbsp;opened up to a guru about this and he mumbled something about no support for UTF-8.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I was a man on a mission. I would find out all about this UTF-8 and conquer this land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language" title="">SGML</a>-like markup once again. I armed myself with all the information on the interwebs and even bought a hard copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unicode-explained/059610121X/" title="">O'Reilly mini reference on UTF-8</a>. Then I kind of got it, but things were complicated in the real world. Some things were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" title="">UTF-8</a>, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" title="">ISO-8859-1</a> and occasionally there was some random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Latin_encoding" title="">Macintosh Latin</a> from a unicorn who could do design and HTML. I read deeper and started seeing nightmares about monsters like the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" title="">Byte Order Mark</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" title="">Endianness</a>. Cumulatively I spent weeks on&nbsp;figuring out character sets from files&nbsp;and parsing out something not fÃ©d.</p><p>I was still quite confused&nbsp;with the prospect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16" title="">UTF-16</a> and what it would mean for me. Gladly that seemed to have been a whole lot of nothing, and with a steady&nbsp;diet of Linux, OS X and Windows on the desktop it seemed the worst was over. There were some cases where I needed to figure out strange issues with broken characters (usually because of using <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/PHP-the-good-parts.png" title="">non-multibyte safe functions</a> on the server), but this was much more of my own fault than random wonky encodings from input data.</p><p>Still, there were some systems not using UTF-8 by default.&nbsp;There was little incentive for that as it wasn't like there were new letters being added to the English alphabet&nbsp;or anything. This changed gradually with the mainstream adoption of smartphones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" title="">Emojis</a>. Those cute little&nbsp;🖼️s are essentially new letters to the alphabet. To stay relevant in the age of social media you had to support emoji&nbsp;or you were&nbsp;💀 in the 💧. Fast forward to today and I can't remember the time I wrestled broken characters.</p><p>There are still enterprise&nbsp;systems that can suffer a death by a thousand candy-bar emojis&nbsp;and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html" title="">UTF-8 quirks in MySQL</a>, but overall I am now in a much happier&nbsp;place. I still don't really know how all this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)" title="">character set black magic</a>&nbsp;works deep down, but I don't need to know. For most part it's now a non-issue in my life. And it's amusing to see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-apple-ios-11-1-new-emojis-security-updates.html" title="">Apple using new emojis as a carrot</a> to get people to install the latest security patches. This was a fun nostalgia trip, but I certainly wouldn't want to go back in time to work on multilingual web development. Or implement designs with rounded corners.</p><p>I'd like to extend a&nbsp;big thank you to everyone for using emoji! You saved my&nbsp;🍑!</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christiannkoepke?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Christiann Koepke</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/peaches-tree?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

It makes it hard for people that step in the field to see the signal in the noise.</p><p>In this article, I try to take a step back and explain what the current ecosystem is made of. <em>Why do we have this multitude of products and where does every part fit in the modern enterprise ?</em> There will be quite some simplification. In reality, every company is different and has different needs.</p><h3>Early 2000s : The rise of the internet and data volumes</h3><p>With the rise of the internet, companies struggled with the growing number of data sources they had to handle. Company data got siloed in different relational databases.
This prevented companies from quickly getting <strong>data analytics</strong> and <strong>actionable insights</strong> about customers, sales…</p><p>Data warehouses provided a solution by bringing together all the siloed relational databases into one single source of truth, used to provide a 360° view of customer data.</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="svg917" version="1.1"

    </span><h3>2010 to 2015 : Cloud transition and the shaping of modern data warehouses</h3><p>Nevertheless, during the early 2010’s, the majority of large companies were still hesitating about whether to stay on-premise or move to the cloud, and kept waiting for a major Big Data service provider that made things easier.</p><p>Only early adopter large companies made the move to invest in Big Data technologies. It turned out that it wasn’t a simple technology adoption, but it needed a company wide <strong>data driven culture,</strong> new job titles and a multitude of complex data processes.</p><p>During these years, a pattern change happened for data warehouses.</p><p>Due to data volume increase and data variety, as well as due to the rise of business analytics expectations, companies started experiencing a bottleneck on the staging layer of the data warehouse. It usually took weeks or months to integrate a new data source in the Extract - Transform - Load pattern.</p><p>In addition to structured transactional data, companies started to collect more and more behavioral data with a fast changing schema.</p><p>Finally, there was a realization that storage costs were far more affordable than before. Computation power of the data warehouses also went up. Therefore, it made sense to load the data in the warehouse before transforming it.</p><p>3 shifts started happening :</p><ul><li><strong>From ETL</strong> (Extract-Transform-Load) <strong>to ELT</strong> (Extract-Load-Transform)</li><li><strong>From On premise to the Cloud</strong>  : Cloud service providers could provide easy and elastic data warehouses that fit the company needs.</li><li><strong>from Hadoop to new Data Lakes</strong>: Data Lakes are centralized raw data staging areas, (It could be a simple Amazon S3 repository or Google Cloud Storage, or it could have more capabilities)</li></ul><p>Moreover, the rise of infrastructures that can handle huge amounts of data paved the way to the rise of IoT and connected objects which found a lot of success. This, in turn, increased the amount of data some companies had to handle.</p><h3>2015 - 2017: Data Plumbing and AI Hype</h3><p>The main Big Data infrastructure seams clearer to most companies, the main challenges are now about how to easily and quickly ingest data and how to quickly make it available to analysts and business users.</p><p>Data Engineers are hired to take care of the data plumbing around the modern data warehouse. We see the rise of data flow automation tools like Apache Airflow. These tools enable companies to automate the ingestion and the transformation part of a data pipeline.</p><p>We feel that NoSQL loses some momentum and SQL is officially back with tools that allow SQL queries on unstructured and structured data warehouse data. (Snowflake, BigQuery)</p><p>The “Big data” hype reaches a plateau, not because it’s not relevant anymore, but because it’s now a reality. A new field retains most of the media attention. Artificial intelligence is the new gold. Following some deep learning advancements, Machine learning gains a lot of attraction.</p><p>This, democratizes the <strong>operational use of AI</strong> to explore and offer <strong>data powered products</strong>. (Recommendation systems, Predictive maintenance …) . As a result and thanks to the stabilization of ML methodologies, we saw the birth of DataOps collaborative platforms that enable companies to easily experiment with ML models on business data.</p><blockquote><p>For large organizations: if you’re not actively building a Big Data + AI strategy at this point (either homegrown or by partnering with vendors), you’re exposing yourself to obsolescence. - Matt Turk</p></blockquote><span>

In order to avoid vendor lock-in and optimize costs, many companies are opting for hybrid approaches with a mix of private cloud, public cloud and on-premise.</li><li>Data cataloging and meta data management :
Data and data sources are the base of this whole systems. They need to be properly indexed, enriched and referenced to make it easier for anyone to find them and know how to use them.
In the same vein, we see the need for “feature catalogs” needed in the machine learning pipeline.</li><li>Data quality :
Data quality means ensuring data integrity, consistency, availability and usability at every stage of the data pipeline.</li><li>Security and privacy :
Following the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, privacy issues became more important for companies and for the general public.
New regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) introduced new data tracing and security constraints.
Companies need easy solutions to centralize data access controls. The use of data must be traced and controlled.</li></ul><p>Below, you’ll find a quite complete reference architecture diagram of the modern data infrastructure.

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut + tr (GNU coreutils, 47288 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.212s
user    0m0.371s
sys     0m0.138s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | awk '{print $5}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.460s
user    0m0.379s
sys     0m0.225s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3</b>
</p>

<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[4])

real    0m4.450s
user    0m3.693s
sys     0m0.934s
</pre>

<p>
Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out
on top this time as well.
</p>


<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>"Is C good as first language?" "Is&nbsp;there still future with C?"
"Why should I even bother with C?" "C is old!" …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard such words? Well, I have. Countless of times, be it
in direct conversation or on a forum. The response is, as always, "it depends",
but in my humble opinion learning C is really valuable experience.</p>

<p>In this not too long text I hope to show you what I think makes C great.</p>

<h3 id="spirit-of-c">Spirit of C</h3>

<p>Let's start with a quote from document <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99RationaleV5.10</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The C89 Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the traditional spiritof C.
There are many facets of the spirit of C, but the essence is a community
sentiment of the underlying principles upon which the C language is based.
Some of the facets of the spirit of C can be summarized in phrases like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Trust the programmer.</em></li>
    <li><em>Don’t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.</em></li>
    <li><em>Keep the language small and simple.</em></li>
    <li><em>Provide only one way to do an operation.</em></li>
    <li><em>Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Above points directly relate to what I will talk further in the article.</p>

<h3 id="mid-level">"Mid-level"</h3>

<p>In regards of level, there are two types of languages: low and high.</p>

<p>Low-level languages are close to the hardware, the only closer thing to CPU
would be electricity itself. Those languages are divided into machine code and
Assembly. The former is a stream of raw, usually binary, data. If somebody is
required to work with it, usually does it using more "readable" hexadecimal form.</p>

<p>Second-generation languages - Assembly - provide one abstraction level on top
of the machine code. Those languages are mostly only a mapping of human-readable
symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants,
strings and so on. Also are different for each processor.</p>

<p>How do high-level languages, providing more abstraction, compare? Quoting Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of
developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how
"high-level" a programming language is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: low = more machine friendly, high = more human friendly.</p>

<p>C is high-level, but back when it was created, most of the work was still being
done in low-level Assembly. As a result, C has lower level of abstraction than
other (still) widely used languages, hence I like to call it "mid-level".</p>

<p>You can also easily (with less language bloat) compile C code to Assembly
instead to binary and examine what instructions CPU will execute.</p>

<p>And if it there is a need, popular C compilers offers you the option in C level
down and use inline Assembly to squeeze everything out of CPU. Not really many
other languages implement such a thing.</p>

<h3 id="fairly-simple">Fairly simple</h3>

<p>Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated,
but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment,
memorizing and fiddling.</p>

<p>C is mid-level, so "by definition" it's easier. But there comes the surprise,
learning it is easier compared to higher level languages. Why? Because of really
simple syntax and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured paradigm</a>
(don't confuse with <code>struct</code>!). It doesn't take so much to learn the basics.
Loops, functions, structures, pointers, variables, types - the core of language.
Intense week to get the general idea. The rest is "just" maths and CS theorem.</p>

<p>But, but, but, but! Don't get me wrong! To master anything you will
need a lot more practice! <strong>A lot!</strong> And it's truth for anything out there!</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-lightweight">Fast and lightweight</h3>

<p>Standard C library is small compared to other languages (e.g Java). It's small
enough for you to try to memorize all functions successfully (not that it would
be a huge benefit). Yeah, many things should be deprecated long ago, there
obviously is some bloat (try to maintains something without bloat for few years,
let alone few decades), but there is not much enough of it to hinder the performance.</p>

<p>And what if libc is still too much? Nothing stands in the way of not using it
at all. Just don't include any of its headers - not even simple <code>printf()</code> will
be present. Replace it with any other library of your choice.</p>

<p>Maturity, emphasis on proper memory management, inline Assembly, small abstraction
and little bloat gives programmer really good control over the program.</p>

<p>This makes C an ideal choice for OS kernels (Linux, Windows NT or macOS's XNU to
name a few) or other languages (e.g. Python). That's also why C is so popular
on embedded systems, where you cannot afford to waste resources.</p>

<h3 id="ubiquity--portability">Ubiquity = portability</h3>

<p>Does there exist any (still) significant platform with no C compiler available?
Except for those which run only Assembly, I've never heard about one.
C programs are present on your high-end gaming PC, on NASA spacecrafts and
in ticket machines. Literally everywhere. C software runs the world.</p>

<p>In accordance to previous paragraphs, C is peculiarly strong choice for
microcontrollers and other forms of embedded systems, which surround us every day.</p>

<p>And have you heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>?
Turns out many other languages like to have some kind of compatibility with C.</p>

<p>You don't need to worry if you will be able to use this language somewhere as
for 99% you can! (Although it doesn't mean you should…) It means, that while
code may not be 100% portable, you will be a portable programmer.</p>

<h3 id="the-influencer">The influencer</h3>

<p>C has both directly and indirectly influenced innumerous amount of languages.
C++, Java, Go, D, Rust, Perl, even PHP and Python - those are but few examples.</p>

<p>Obviously, knowledge of C isn't needed to learn any of them and sometimes
may even push you to use not the best practices.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think it's important to remember the roots. And if you are
cautious, familiarity with C might give you some foothold. It's especially the
case with C++.</p>

<h3 id="rich-collection-of-libraries">Rich collection of libraries</h3>

<p>I suspect all this talk about fastness, lightness, mid-level, Assembly etc. might
have give you an idea, you will need to implement everything yourself. There may
be not any <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>
like in Java or other or other functionality like garbage collector…
True, true, except…  not entirely.</p>

<p>C is mature and popular language. Name a thing and believe me, somebody somewhere
already created library for it (although if think about something too obscure,
you won't find it for all the world, but it does exists).</p>

<p>You want garbage collector? <a href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">Boehm GC</a> has you covered.
TUI? Nothing like timeless <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/">ncurses</a>.
Examples can be listed almost infinitely:
<a href="https://gtk.org/">GTK</a>,
<a href="https://pdcurses.org/">PDCurses</a>,
<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>,
<a href="https://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a>,
<a href="https://codeplea.com/genann">Genann</a>,

<a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON">cJSON</a>,
<a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a>,
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>…</p>

<p>It's very universal language - you can program basically anything: web server,
video game (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/id-Software">classics from <em>id Software</em></a>),
operating system, other programming language or wrapper forcing Firefox to obey
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG Base Directory specification</a>,
because when I'm an administrator, the programs will do exacly what I told them to!</p>

<p>However, please, remember - the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. For example,
if you want to create a video game, you really ought to turn your eyes to C++.
And you should know, that…</p>

<h3 id="c-is-highly-backward-compatible">C++ is highly backward compatible</h3>

<p>Why do I even make the whole point out of C++ here? Because it's one of most
widely used languages today and you encountering it is more than certain.</p>

<p>In contrary to other languages embracing C compatibility, C++ was created as its
direct descendant and committee goes to great lengths to keep the "copy-paste"
compatibility with it - in most cases you can compile C code as C++ just fine.</p>

<p>Don't be mistaken, C++ isn't by any means a superset of C - the code isn't always
going to work with C++ and a good C code isn't necessary good C++ code. Consider example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Proper way in C, but in C++ there ought to be <code>(int*)</code> before <code>malloc()</code>,
for it to work, not to mention you should use <code>new int[10]</code> instead.</p>

<p>Although in most cases you can use C library safely in your C++ project.</p>

<p>All examples from the previous point not only <strong>can be</strong>, but <strong>often are</strong>
used in such way. E.g. I myself used <em>ncurses</em> in my C++ code for hex editor
<a href="https://joren.ga/bym/">Bym</a>.</p>

<p>Even libraries already compiled with C compiler can be made compatible with C++,
thanks to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage"><code>extern "C"</code></a>
linkage specifier.</p>

</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="a-blot-on-the-landscape">A blot on the landscape…</h3>

<p>C was created in year 1972 on the foundation of B language, so over the years
it acquired some quirks (<code>memcpy()</code> is defined in string header!), some things
became obsolete, some useless and are kept only for compatibility with old code.</p>

<p>A beginner is likely to burn a lot of time chasing down strange behavior caused
by memory corruption with no idea how to reason about, what may lead actually
big discouraged to programming in general. There is little to none mechanism
to prevent programmer from shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>It's also important to take into account that C is not the introduction to
Computer Science. Learning none of languages is. You need to study it properly
to get a true understanding of this vast field. If not formal education in
university, then online one will be good too. The Internet is full of resources,
some can be found on my <a href="https://joren.ga/urlsList/">list of URLs</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Learning C is valuable experience and it's worth it. If not as your first
language, then as second, third, fourth or whatever. There are a lot of advantages,
but also some disadvantages. At least trying won't hurt. Give it a chance, who
knows, you may truly get to like it, just like me.</p>

<p>And don't believe people saying "C is dead" or "It will soon be replaced"
(I'm looking at you Rust fans). C is fine and will be relevant for few next decades too.
Heck! COBOL, nearly forgotten, yet there are still job openings! How is C supposed
to become obscure when, in the moment I write those words, there is planned new
standard …</p></div></div>

The two most popular apprehensions are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"I need it for less.. technical users"</em> (or some variation of thereof)</li><li><em>"I need it for CI"</em> (continuous integration)</li></ul>



<p>There was a time I shared this hopeful belief.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_it_and_they_will_come">"Build it and they will come"</a> sort of thing.</p>
<p>I was deluding my self and perhaps you are too.
Unless your software is truly useful to many, or already popular through some other means, they will not come, Github or otherwise.</p>
<p>"But everyone has an account there so, it will be one step away".
A mostly-imaginary threshold.
It's in your head.
Think about it.. those with skills &amp; time, who can wholesomely contribute, will highly likely to already have email and perhaps <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (<a href="https://movim.eu/">Movim</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>.
It is not the facilities stopping them, it's either skill or will to dedicate time.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but Github's interface is just easier and has issue-tracking and ..".
Again, mostly-imaginary threshold.
If one wishes to participate in a project, <em>really</em>, <strong>truly</strong>, wishing to participate, the buttons will not be a barrier.
In fact, from my brief time on Github and Gitlab, all I can attribute to the glossy interfaces was the drive-by comments, without any follow-through or interaction.
So it's a good filter rather than a bad barrier.</p>


<p>This is not the answer you are looking for.
I never bought into this and still stand by it.</p>
<p>Is your build complicated beyond what you can cope with?
Your tools taking longer than you can bare waiting for?</p>
<p>What does it say about our skills &amp; tools when the solution we gravitate towards is a commercial behemoth providing more automation, wattage &amp; time than we have at home?</p>
<p>How is it open when our dependency to this service seems to increase without any programmer being able to resist it?</p>
<p>And what about the environmental impact of continuously running these processes?</p>
<p>This is not a solution.
It is a harmful distraction, digression &amp; deferment both from writing good &amp; efficient code and migrating to a more nimble solution by upping our game.</p>


<p>Github (Gitlab too) have become the Facebook-Twitter of coders.
Merchants of "sweet approval", intermediaries we designated when we became desperate for the attention of others online.</p>
<p>Our insatiable desire for commentary, 'stars' &amp; pull-requests has gifted that enterprise an immense gravity.
While we are hooked on their mesmerising gimmicks, students are taught Github's interface instead of <code>git</code> commands and are expected to have an account with them if they are to register on the corporate map when searching for a job.</p>
<p>Worse still, we may have lost our soul.
Would we write code if no one was watching? For the enjoyment of the practice itself?
Those answering <em>yes</em>, fear not, you don't need them!</p>
<p>Move on, there is still a community out there, where you stand a better chance of (literally) unscripted interaction.
Our open source code, has propped their dominance for too long.
It's time to take it back!</p>

<p>Performance is important for many Rust programs. </p>
<p>This book contains many techniques that can improve the performance—speed and
memory usage—of Rust programs. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/compile-times.html">Compile Times</a> section also contains some
techniques that will improve the compile times of Rust programs. Some of the
book’s techniques only require changing build configurations, but many require
changing code.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques within are entirely Rust-specific, and some involve
ideas that can be applied (often with modifications) to programs written in
other languages. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/general-tips.html">General Tips</a> section also includes some general
principles that apply to any programming language. Nonetheless, this book is
mostly about the performance of Rust programs and is no substitute for a
general purpose guide to profiling and optimization.</p>
<p>The book also focuses on techniques that are practical and proven: many are
accompanied by links to pull requests or other resources that show how the
technique was used on a real-world Rust program.</p>
<p>This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced Rust users. Beginner Rust users
have more than enough to learn and these techniques are likely to be an
unhelpful distraction to them.</p>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; <a href="http://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> interacts with the new Python and Scala/Java Software Development Kit (SDK) available in Hopsworks 2.0. The new SDK builds on our extensive experience working with Enterprise customers and users with Enterprise requirements. With this new release, we consolidate multiple libraries with a single one. We named it `HSFS` (HopsworkS Feature Store) and in this blog post we will be looking at some of the improvements and key features that the new SDK brings.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing the new Hopsworks Feature Store API. Rebuilt from the ground up, today’s release includes the first set of new endpoints and features we’re launching so developers can help the world connect to the public conversation happening on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can’t wait to check it out, <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">visit Hopsworks.ai</a> to get started. If you can, then read on for more about what we’re building, what’s new about the Feature Store API v2.<br></p><h2>Rethinking the Hopsworks Feature Store API</h2><p>The Hopsworks Feature Store was <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/feature-store-the-missing-data-layer-in-ml-pipelines" target="_blank">first released at the end of 2018</a>, and it included a new type of Feature Store API based on the FeatureGroup (DataFrame). When designing the Hopsworks Feature Store, we looked at existing feature stores (<a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/" target="_blank">Michelangelo</a> by Uber and <a href="https://databricks.com/session/zipline-airbnbs-machine-learning-data-management-platform" target="_blank">Zipline</a> by AirBnb) that provided Domain Specific Language (DSL) APIs to their Feature Stores - you declaratively define features, and the DSL is then executed to ingest feature data into the Feature Store. However, we were building a general-purpose Feature Store and we knew that history has not been kind to DSLs - they have their day in the sun, but general purpose frameworks and languages win out in the long-run. So, we went with the FeatureGroup (DataFrames in Spark or Pandas) as the way to ingest and export features to/from the Hopsworks Feature Store. Since then, other Feature Stores have followed our approach, such as Feast that introduced <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.3.0" target="_blank">FeatureSets in 0.3</a> almost 1 year later and <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.8.0" target="_blank">Spark support</a> almost 2 years later).&nbsp;</p><p>However, our API still encouraged developers to think of features as existing in a flat namespace. With great customers, such as <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/bet" target="_blank">PaddyPower</a>, we rethought and redesigned our Feature Store API to consider other practical problems we encountered, such as making breaking changes to FeatureGroup schemas without breaking existing feature pipelines, handling feature naming conflicts, and redesigning a minimal single client library (from 2 libraries previously) that can run in either a (Py)Spark or Python environment. That library is now released as our new Feature Store API and is called <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/feature-store-api" target="_blank">HSFS</a>.<br></p><h2>Feature Reuse with Pandas-like Joins</h2><p>HSFS provides a DataFrame API to ingest data into the Hopsworks Feature Store. You can also retrieve feature data in a DataFrame, that can either be used directly to train models or materialized to file(s) for later use to train models</p><p>The idea of the Feature Store is to have pre-computed features available for both training and serving models. The key functionality required to generate training datasets from reusable features are: feature selection, joins, filters and point in time queries. To enable this functionality, we are introducing a new expressive Query abstraction with HSFS that provides these operations and guarantees reproducible creation of training datasets from features in the Feature Store.&nbsp;</p><p>The new joining functionality is heavily inspired by the APIs used by Pandas to merge DataFrames. The APIs allow you to specify which features to select from which feature group, how to join them and which features to use in join conditions.</p><p>If a data scientist wants to modify a new feature that is not available in the Feature Store, she can write code to compute the new feature (using existing features or external data) and ingest the new feature values into the Feature Store. If the new feature is based solely on existing feature values in the Feature Store, we call it a <em>derived feature</em>. The same HSFS APIs can be used to compute derived features as well as features using external data sources.</p><div><p># create a query<br>feature_join = rain_fg.select_all()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(temperature_fg.select_all(), on=["date", "location_id"])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(location_fg.select_all())</p><p>td = fs.create_training_dataset("rain_dataset",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version=1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label=”weekly_rain”, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_format=”tfrecords”)</p><p># materialize query in the specified file format<br>td.save(feature_join)</p><p># use materialized training dataset for training, possibly in a different environment<br>td = fs.get_training_dataset(“rain_dataset”, version=1)</p><p># get TFRecordDataset to use in a TensorFlow model<br>dataset = td.tf_data().tf_record_dataset(batch_size=32, num_epochs=100)</p><p># reproduce query for online feature store and drop label for inference<br>jdbc_querystring = td.get_query(online=True, with_label=False)</p></div><p>When using HSFS to create a training dataset, the features, their order and how the feature groups are joined is also saved as metadata. This metadata is then used at serving time to build a JDBC query that is executed by a client (along with the feature group primary key values) to request a feature vector from the online Feature Store for a specific model.<br></p><h2>Features belong in a hierarchical namespace</h2><p>When we started building the Hopsworks Feature Store we wanted to create a flat namespace for features to make it easier for data scientists to pick the features they wanted. But as soon as our customers started having tens of thousands of features in the feature store, feature naming conflicts became commonplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Features like <em>created_on, customer_id, account_id, </em>are often used in many different unrelated Feature Groups. The same user might, for example, have a different account_id for each service the company provides.Imagine an e-commerce use case - most likely you will have multiple `created_on` or `revenue`-named features.</p><p>In HSFS we solved this challenge by requiring users to work with the feature group abstraction - users have to specify which features they need from which feature group. The feature groups abstraction also allows the query planner to intelligently&nbsp; identify which feature to use when joining features from different feature groups.<br></p><h2>Time travel as first class citizen</h2><p>Hopsworks has offered support for <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Hudi</a> for over one year. Apache Hudi is the key component to make time travel, upserts, and ACID updates possible on feature data. Time travel enables data engineers and data scientists to retrieve a previous snapshot of the feature data for debugging and auditing purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>In HSFS, we added support for complex time travel queries, allowing users to create training datasets by retrieving different feature groups at different points in time. The different times are stored as metadata alongside the training datasets. This enables users to easily reproduce the creation of training datasets with historical feature values.</p><p>The new SDK improves support for Apache Hudi by integrating directly with the feature groups and joining APIs. Apache Hudi is also now available for the Python APIs. The APIs hide the complexity of dealing with Apache Hudi options. At the same time the high level APIs will allow us to implement support for additional formats such as <a href="https://delta.io/" target="_blank">Delta Lake</a>.<br></p><h2>Provenance and custom metadata</h2><p>Provenance for feature data is a key new functionality available as part of HSFS. Hopsworks Feature Store implicity tracks dependencies between feature groups, training datasets and models. Provenance allows users to know, at any given moment, what features are the most widely used and also what features are not used anymore and could potentially be removed from the feature store. Provenance also enables users to traverse from a model to the application used to train it, the input training dataset used, and the features and feature group snapshots used to create the training dataset.</p><p>In this new release we also allow users to create and attach user-defined labels to feature groups and training datasets. Labels and tags enable users to build a custom metadata catalog for their Feature Store, that (using <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>) supports low-latency free-text search over potentially thousands of features, descriptions, labels and tags.<br></p><h2>ML Framework APIs to Training Datasets</h2><p>While the Hopsworks feature store plays a key role in defining governance around feature data, improving execution speed when it comes to experimenting, building and deploying models, the ultimate customers of the feature stores are the data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p><p>To make their interaction with the feature store as smooth as possible, we added support retrieving training dataset as a TensorFlow Dataset format using tf.Data. This allows data scientists to efficiently read training datasets in their TensorFlow code.<br></p><h2>Pure Python Feature Engineering</h2><p>Alongside existing support for (Py)Spark, this release also brings supports for feature engineering pipelines built using pure Python programs. With HSFS you are able to upload feature data to the feature store from your SageMaker notebook, KubeFlow, Jupyter notebook, or even your local machine.</p><p>This is in addition to the existing capabilities of exploratory data analysis with the feature store from your notebook, and the creation and reading of training datasets.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>You can get started immediately by creating a new cluster on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">https://hopsworks.ai</a>, the library is already pre-installed in your environment so you can get started straight away.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">documentation</a> is available and you can walk through one of the many example <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/tree/master/notebooks/featurestore/hsfs" target="_blank">notebooks</a> that are available here.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

November 17, 2020 | https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In our <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to tonfiguration management tools post">previous blog post</a>, we looked at what configuration management
tools bring to the table. And in this post, we will take a closer look at
Ansible, our configuration management tool of choice. So if you want to learn
what Ansible is, what it does, and how it works, this is the post for you.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> and some of the benefits we gain when
using it. Next, we will describe the differences between three different
Ansible packages and give some advice on picking the right one for our use
case. We will continue with the installation instructions and finally wrap up
with an interactive walkthrough of Ansible’s basic functionality like running
Ansible playbooks and installing extra Ansible content.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ansible">What is Ansible</h2>
<p>We all probably heard about automation systems that suffer from <em>managing the
management</em> and <em>automating your automation</em> issues. Ansible not only brings
order to our infrastructure, but it also does it sustainably.</p>
<p>Because Ansible is <strong>agentless</strong>, dealing with daemons being down,
upgrading agents, and patching agent security vulnerabilities are a thing of
the past.  All we need to do is keep our control node (the computer where the
Ansible runs) updated, and we should be safe.</p>
<p>But what does Ansible do exactly? <strong>Ansible’s primary responsibility is to
reliably enforce the desired state on a set of targets.</strong></p>
<p>We usually keep the state description in a relatively human-friendly and
machine-executable file called an Ansible playbook. We have a bit more
flexibility when it comes to storing information about targets. We can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static inventory files</strong> that contain login information for our targets.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory plugins</strong> that fetch connection information from some
canonical sources like IaaS API.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enforcing the desired state</strong> in the Ansible world can mean almost anything:
writing a configuration file, creating a virtual machine in the cloud, adding
a VLAN to a network switch, etc. All we need is an Ansible module for
performing the task at hand. And there are a lot of them available out there.
We will talk more about how to obtain them in the last part of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> (or <strong>host</strong>) is also quite a broad term in the Ansible world.
Historically, the primary target type was a virtual machine that Ansible
managed via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. But today, Ansible can control
many other things like containers, networking equipment, and various
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. And because Ansible is
agentless, getting it to work with a specific piece of software or hardware is
usually much easier compared to other configuration management tools.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to start talking about Ansible versions.</p>
<h2 id="what-ansible-package-to-use">What Ansible package to use</h2>
<p>Today, there are three Ansible packages that we can use for our day-to-day
automatization tasks: <code>ansible-2.9</code>, <code>ansible-2.10</code>, and <code>ansible-base-2.10</code>.
Why? Because the monolithic Ansible package was split into a core engine and a
few bundles of Ansible content called Ansible Collections for the 2.10
release.</p>
<p>But fortunately for us, selecting the correct package is relatively simple.
Just answer the following questions in order and stop when you answer “yes”
for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you a Red Hat subscriber or want to purchase support? Use
<strong>ansible-2.9</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you have existing playbooks and no time to learn about Ansible
Collections? Use <strong>ansible-2.10</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>ansible-base-2.10</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made sure examples from this blog post work with all of the versions
mentioned above, so you should have no trouble following along.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-install-ansible">How to install Ansible</h2>
<p>We only need to install Ansible onto the control node (the computer or virtual
machine you will run Ansible commands on). The most flexible way of installing
Ansible is using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install --user "ansible==2.9.*"  # For ansible 2.9
$ pip install --user ansible           # For ansible 2.10 and newer
$ pip install --user ansible-base      # For ansible-base
</code></pre>
<p>This will install Ansible only for our user account and not mess up the system
if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>We can also install Ansible using our distribution’s package manager (for
example, <code>dnf</code> on RHEL 8 or <code>apt</code> on Debian-derived distributions).</p>
<pre><code>$ yum install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 7
$ dnf install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 8
$ apt install ansible  # Debian and Ubuntu
</code></pre>
<p>But bear in mind that most distributions do not package <code>ansible-base</code> and
<code>ansible</code> 2.10 yet, so you might need to resort to the <code>pip</code> method for the
time being. Official <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html" title="Official installation instructions">installation instructions</a> contain even more
installation-related details.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use a Windows machine as an Ansible control node.
Matt Davis, one of the core Ansible developers, wrote a
<a href="http://blog.rolpdog.com/2020/03/why-no-ansible-controller-for-windows.html" title="Why no Ansible controller for Windows?">blog post</a> about the reasons. Matt also gives some hints about
what Windows users can do to remedy the situation, so make sure you check his
post out.</p>
<p>Once the installation is behind us, we should be able to run the following
command without errors:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.14
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.6 (default, Sep 25 2020, 00:00:00) [GCC 10.2.1 20200723]
</code></pre>
<p>If nothing went awry, we are ready to start playing with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="taking-ansible-for-a-spin">Taking Ansible for a spin</h2>
<p>In this last section, we will play around a bit with Ansible. We will start by
analyzing a small Ansible playbook and explaining the purpose of its
components, continue with discussing the Ansible inventory, and conclude
our escapade with some custom Ansible content installation.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow along with us, you will need a Linux computer with
Ansible and Docker installed.</p>
<h3 id="ansible-playbook">Ansible playbook</h3>
<p>Let us start with something relatively simple:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: /tmp/my.cfg
        content: Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you never heard about Ansible playbook or YAML before, you probably
guessed that we want to create the <code>/tmp/my.cfg</code> file with the <code>Hello, World!</code>
inside it on our local computer. Let us test this. When we run the
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command (we assumed that the playbook is stored in the
<code>play.yaml</code> file), we will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>And sure enough, if we open the <code>/tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> file, the hello is there ;)
But how did Ansible know what to do? Explanation time ;)</p>
<p>Ansible playbook is nothing more than a list of plays that Ansible executes
one after another. For the sake of simplicity, our example contains a single
Configure local computer play. The <code>hosts: localhost</code> line informed Ansible
that we will be messing with our local computer. This is the target that we
talked about previously.</p>
<p>All real action happened in the <code>tasks</code> section of the play. The
<code>ansible.builtin.copy:</code> line told Ansible that we want to use the built-in
copy module to create a file. And the <code>dest: /tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> and <code>content: Hello</code> parameter lines provided information to the copy module about our
file’s location and what to place inside it, respectively. The line that
starts with <code>- name</code> serves as documentation for us and is printed to the
output when Ansible starts executing the task at hand.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Ansible did not create a file. It would be more accurate
to say that Ansible made sure our text file exists and has the correct
content. We can see this technical nitpick in action if we run the same
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command again:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how in the previous run, Ansible reported our file creation task as
changed, and in this last run, the output changed to ok. This happened because
Ansible determined that the file’s current and desired state are precisely the
same, and there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>But our configuration files are rarely entirely static, meaning that we often
need to customize their content based on some external information. And this
is where variables and <code>ansible.builtin.template</code> module come into play - pun
intended ;).</p>
<p>Using variables in templates is reasonably straightforward: we just need to
place the variable name inside double curly braces, and the template module
will replace it with the variable’s value. For example, this is how our
parameterized configuration file could look:</p>
<pre><code>{{ greeting }} from {{ ansible_distribution }}, World!
</code></pre>
<p>But before we can use the variable, we need to define it somewhere. There are
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html" title="Official Ansible documentation in variables">many places</a> where Ansible will look for variable definitions, but we
will keep it simple and provide them as part of the playbook (the <code>vars</code>
section in the listing below).</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    greeting: Welcome

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      …</code></pre></div></div>

        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act. No faster app as these features were  available with IRCTC which were disabled to ensure level playing field .</p>— IRCTC (@IRCTCofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/IRCTCofficial/status/1328668272032583683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote></div><div><h3><strong>From Tirupur to Super Tatkal</strong></h3><p>The story of Super Tatkal has its roots in Yuvarajaa’s journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, India’s self-described Silicon Valley.</p><p>Yuvarajaa comes from a family of farmers—&nbsp;his father worked as one until he died in 2008 and his mother, Eswari, still cultivates the family’s 30 acres of land.</p><p>Yuvarajaa recalls that he first started programming in BASIC as an 11-year-old. Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

They were writing code the whole time, and I was on the phone the whole time, and being in the office we ended up interrupting each other. So eventually we started working from our homes and only got together when we needed to catch up.</p><p>As the company grew, we were hiring lots of artists and freelancers based everywhere from Los Angeles to Toronto. Even though there were more of us, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office space when most of the team was somewhere else anyway. We could simply hop on Skype, have our conversation, and get back to work. We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Mining Haul Trucks – The Largest SVBIEDs In The World"><div><p><span>The SVBIEDs used by the Islamic State (IS) throughout the years have come in all different sizes. Everything from sedans, to pick-up trucks, heavy transport trucks, heavy construction equipment, and military armoured vehicles have been converted into rolling bombs. While large shell vehicles have been relatively common, there’s one rare category of vehicles completely unmatched both in its absurd size and obscurity <span>— t</span>he mining haul trucks. There has only been 3 recorded cases of IS using this vehicle type in SVBIED attacks, ever.&nbsp;In this article I will be detailing all available information about these attacks, beginning with the first example in August, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 1 — Homs province, Syria (August, 2015)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late May 2015, IS managed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11633289/Isil-seizes-Syrian-regimes-lucrative-phosphate-mines.html">seize the strategic town of Khunayfis</a>, located approximately 60 kilometres to the Southwest of Palmyra in the central Syrian desert of Homs province. Along with the town, IS militants also seized the Khunayfis phosphate mine. The mine is one of two in the area, with the other one located at al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. In a photo released by IS from the Sawwanah facility which was also captured around the same time,&nbsp;at least 6 <a href="https://belsat.eu/en/news/isis-militants-have-worlds-biggest-armored-cars-made-belarusian-belaz-dump-trucks/">Belarusian-made Belaz&nbsp;haul trucks</a> could be seen lined up. These massive vehicles are traditionally employed in large mining operations, but IS would find a much more destructive use for them.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="619" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg 980w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-300x189.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px">In the spirit of experimentation and not letting anything go to waste, IS decided to move one of these Belaz haul trucks to one of their workshops near the town of al-Qaryatayn, where it would be overhauled to function as an SVBIED. It’s unclear whether the chosen haul truck was taken from Khunayfis or al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. A photo taken during the manufacturing process showed that the massive vehicle had been plastered with a primary layer of improvised frontal armour in the form of metal sheets, and a secondary layer of improvised slat armour on top. At the time of the photo, the driver’s cabin had not yet been up-armoured.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="734" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg 444w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px">On August 19th 2015, the finished haul truck SVBIED was featured in an official IS photo report. With the addition of improvised metal sheets, armoured glass, as well as slat armour to the driver’s cabin, the vehicle was ready to depart on its mission.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg" alt="" width="1021" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg 1021w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px">In one of the photos, the driver of the SVBIED&nbsp;(“Abu Abdullah al-Ansari”) could be seen posing in front of the haul truck.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg 1023w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px">According to IS themselves, the haul truck had been fitted with a hefty explosive payload weighing in at 8 tons. The chosen target for this monstrous SVBIED was the Syrian loyalist-controlled Mafraq checkpoint, located Northeast of al-Qaryatayn. Although the operation itself wasn’t shown in a video, a distant night vision photograph of the detonation was included in the photo report.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.20.56.jpg" alt="" width="1138" height="638" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.20.56.jpg 1138w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.20.56-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.20.56-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.20.56-1024x574.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1138px) 100vw, 1138px"></span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 2 — Anbar province, Iraq (January, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late January 2017, an Iraqi fighter uploaded a remarkable <a href="https://twitter.com/HKaaman/status/825804781352529920">video</a>. The 2-minute long video, shot somewhere in Iraq’s Anbar desert, featured the second recorded example of a Belaz haul truck converted into an up-armoured SVBIED.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-300x167.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-768x428.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-1024x571.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The frontal armour mounted on this haul truck appeared a lot more reserved and inconspicuous than that of its predecessor. Instead of applying a wall of metal sheets to the front, smaller sections had been mounted to key areas. For example, a large centre piece metal sheet shielded the engine. The slats in the sheet were purposely designed to prevent the engine from overheating. A smaller piece of improvised armour was also mounted in front of the&nbsp;right-side set of frontal wheels. The driver’s cabin was the most heavily shielded, with large metal sheets and armoured glass protecting the driver. This change in armour placement is actually fairly logical. The engine, driver’s cabin, and wheels are the weakest points on the haul truck. Hence, most of the work put in to overhaul the vehicle focused on these 3 crucial areas. However, seeing as this haul truck SVBIED was captured before it could be employed in battle, it’s unclear whether more armour additions were intended. a smaller piece of improvised armour mounted in front of he left-side set of frontal wheels seem to be the only component missing though.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg" alt="" width="1277" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg 1277w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-768x429.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px">The overhauled haul truck was found parked at the lower end of a ramp leading into a large desert dug-out. Looking at the vehicle from inside the underground storage facility, it appeared far more imposing.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-1024x574.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The video also included a short look at the rather large explosive payload. The payload consisted of a series of explosive-filled jugs, barrels and gas tanks wired together. Taking into account the size of the rear bed of the haul truck, there was likely more than one layer of IEDs. However, the top layer alone was quite impressive. I estimate the top layer alone consisting of at least 30 large jugs (blue), around 100 smaller jugs (white/yellow/red/green), and 3 gas tanks. Seeing as we don’t know exactly how much explosives were contained in each jug, it’s &nbsp;difficult to get a precise estimate of the weight of the payload.</span></p>

The video itself didn’t provide specifics as to where the SVBIED was seized other than it being in Anbar province. However, there are a number of large mining operations in Anbar province previously under IS control where it could have been taken from originally, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashat">Akashat</a> facility.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 3 — Nineveh province, Iraq (May, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As the battle for Western Mosul entered its final stages in May 2017, the remaining IS contingent put up a fierce defence. In an official video released by IS in mid-May 2017, the third and final example of an up-armoured haul truck SVBIED was featured along with a series of other standardised SVBIEDs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg" alt="" width="1262" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg 1262w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-768x430.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px">The armour placement on this example was noticeably more refined and all-encompassing compared to the previous two examples. A series of inter-connected metal plates covered the entire front of the vehicle. Angled armour with air intakes shielded the engine, and a piece of armoured glass acted as a viewing port for the driver as per usual. Furthermore, both sides of the original rear bed had been removed in favour of an improvised metal sheet. This example was also the first to have been fitted with rear armour shielding the rear wheel sets from incoming fire.</span></p>
<p><span>Identical writings in Arabic on both the frontal armour above the driver’s viewing port and on the rear bed side armour could be roughly translated into “B150”&nbsp;<span><strong>—</strong>&nbsp;a unique identifying serial number.</span></span></p>

The video that this example was featured in actually featured very short snippets of the interior, offering a clue as to how it was set up. In the first section, an IS fighter could be seen climbing up into the vehicle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg" alt="" width="1257" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg 1257w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px">A look at the driver’s seat showed the armoured glass from the inside, and also provided a glimpse of the white box detonation mechanism mounted next to the steering wheel on the right,<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg 1260w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-768x433.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px">The gunner of this 2-man SVBIED was positioned in the next room, protected by improvised metal armour on all sides. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/calibreobscura?lang=en">Calibre Obscura</a>, an expert on identifying small arms, the primary armament was a Chinese-made 12.7mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W85_heavy_machine_gun">W85</a> heavy machine gun fixed on what looked like an improvised pintle mount. The secondary armaments included both a Soviet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_machine_gun">PK</a> machine gun, as well as what appeared to be a Bulgarian AK-type rifle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg" alt="" width="1271" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg 1271w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1271px) 100vw, 1271px">Now, where did IS source this vehicle from? It definitely wasn’t transported all the way from Anbar province. Conveniently enough, the previously IS-controlled Badush cement plant, located approximately 20 kilometres Northwest of W. Mosul operated multiple Belaz haul trucks. When the Iraqi army recaptured the cement plant in June 2017, what remained of the facility and its vehicles was documented in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WytqV_x7c4">video</a> by al-Mawsliya TV. The “B” in the identifying serial number of this example (“B150”) may also have been a reference to its origin, the Badush plant.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg" alt="" width="1139" height="594" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg 1139w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-300x156.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-768x401.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px"></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Efficient use, or Propaganda?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The real question here is whether using gigantic haul trucks as SVBIED shells serves a purpose other than an aesthetic one. Because, let’s face it&nbsp;– The ones that have been recorded really do look impressive. Looking beyond that, the efficiency of using this type of SVBIED is very questionable.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, it doesn’t really make sense to use such a massive shell vehicle as a vessel to carry explosives. When you have a smaller shell vehicle, such as a pick-up truck or even a heavy truck, the vehicle itself acts as more shrapnel and debris upon detonation. However, the bigger and heavier the shell vehicle is, the more explosives is required in order to render it a viable option. For example, mining haul trucks weigh in at around 45 tons, an absurd weight. When you use it as an SVBIED, the frame of the vehicle will absorb a lot of the explosive energy of the payload upon detonation. And while IS claimed that the first haul truck SVBIED had an explosive payload of 8 tons, it’s not really that much when you account for the weight of the haul truck itself and the explosives required to tear it apart.</span></p>
<p><span>The comparatively smaller category of heavy trucks can still carry payloads of the same weight class, and they don’t carry with them the problem of the frame of the vehicle itself being too large. In this aspect, there’s no logic at all to using haul trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>The large size and weight of the haul trucks presents another issue as well. Their slow speed, combined with their large profile, means that they’ll be large targets advancing toward their targets slowly. This means that the opposing force will have a lot more time to fire on a much larger target than …</span></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim">Tim</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian">I</a>
started working on this problem in August 2018 we immediately began playing with <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>.
It was an open source project that gave us a lot of the things Aaron and I had been talking about in order to deliver the
features we felt were critical to our success.  Noms gave us the ability to efficiently diff across commits, and
merge commits.  Though Noms had become an inactive project, we felt it would tremendously improve our go to market
time to use it as our storage layer, so we decided it was worth diving deeper.</p>
<p>I built a demo of a command line tool that used the Git commands people already know in order to
version structured table data.  As we played with the demo, we felt like we were on to something, and
decided to really go after the "Git for Data" product that is <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> today. After additional
investment in delivering a fully featured Git-like command line we began to think about <a href="https://dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a>,
a place for our users to find, collaborate on, and store data projects. This was the first time we needed to access
data stored using Noms on backend servers, and it was at this time we discovered issues with how Noms handled errors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail on the language design decisions behind Go's panics and errors.  If you would like that
background before going further I'd take a look at <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/on-the-uses-and-misuses-of-panics-in-go/">this article</a>
which covers it in depth.  However, a nasty problem with panics is that a panic without a deferred recover on any go routine
will crash your program.  If you are writing a server handling many concurrent requests, any panic that escapes on any
go routine will cause every single one of the concurrently executing requests to fail.  All those connections will be
closed, and the server will restart. In a sufficiently complicated server where go routines handling requests
spawn additional go routines and use <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/communicating-sequential-processes-csp-for-go-developer-in-a-nutshell-866795eb879d">CSP</a>
to do work, using panics for flow control is a recipe for disaster. With so much invested in using Noms, we decided to
"hard fork" the project and eliminate the heavy use of panics.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating panics started out pretty straight forward.  Search the codebase for a panic, change the
signature of the method to return an error, and replace the panic.  Then find all the call sites where the method
and handle the error, or return it up the callstack.  I thought I'd be able to migrate from panics to errors
in about a week.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that Noms could panic when calculating the hash of its types I knew I was way off. In the
end I think I spent closer to 6 weeks on this.  It was time-consuming, and boring, but it couldn't be automated and every
one of the changes was an opportunity to introduce bugs.  Today, searching the updated Noms codebase for <code>if err != nil</code>
returns 1370 results, and I'm guessing more than half of those were introduced while removing panics. It effected hundreds
of function signatures.  Because Noms lies below our main application's code, the changes bubble up to all the code which
depends on Noms directly and indirectly. </p>

<p>GO advocates for using CSP in order to write concurrent code.  New go routines are spawned in order to do parallel processing
and channels are used to communicate between go routines.  It was in these cases where panics were causing the biggest problems,
and they were the more interesting cases to talk about when converting panics to errors, as converting these improperly
can introduce deadlocks.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a simple function we want to run concurrently:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> workItem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> workCh <span>{</span>
        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> err
        <span>}</span>       

        resCh <span>&lt;-</span> res
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function takes a channel that it reads work items from, and a channel that it writes results to.  In the event that
an error is encountered the function returns the error. A straightforward, but erroneous way to handle this would be:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>myConcurrentFunc</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workItems WorkItem<span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>WorkItemResult<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first problem here, is that the <code>err</code> instance is modified and read in an unsafe manner.  This can be resolved using
a mutex or Go's atomic primitives, and this is a simplified version of how I handled these errors in many cases. I created
a class <code>AtomicError</code> that made these types of operations thread safe, but this example still has other issues. </p>
<p>If <code>process()</code> errors on one of the go routines, all the other ones will continue running until they all error, or
all the work items have been completed despite not having any impact (No matter what happens we are going to <code>return nil, err</code>).
Depending on the use, maybe this behavior is acceptable, but in cases where the operation takes a long time, this does not
work.  This can be fixed by testing the state of the atomic error in the <code>process</code> loop but it can make the code pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Another suboptimal characteristic of this code is that you need to create the channels with buffers
large enough to hold every work item, and result.  It is possible to avoid this also, but it involves additional synchronization
in order to close the result channel just a single time when an error is encountered, or when all work is done and the last
go processing routine exits.  </p>
<p>Finally, when we are talking about this being run on a server as a part of a request, there is the very real possibility
that the request may get cancelled for some reason, such as exceeding some pre-defined deadline.  In order to handle this
and the other errors in a cleaner way I wish I had known about <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>.</p>

<p>errgroup is an extremely simple package with just <a href="https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/errgroup/errgroup.go">a single small file</a>.
It uses the <code>context.Context</code> that is used throughout Golang to implement <code>errgroup.Group</code> which will update the context
if any one of them returns an error. Our updated code looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code handles all the issues enumerated above, and it also allows the results to be handled concurrently with the
processing.  In the cases where you are doing something expensive with each result this could provide a performance
improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be only one reason to use panics for flow control. Littering your code with explicit error checking after
every function call is tedious and ugly.  You are right, but the beauty of your code, won't improve your product. Go
forces explicit error handling that results in programs that do the appropriate things when error conditions are encountered.
It may be ugly, but I hope my pain and suffering serve as yet another reason not to use panics instead of returning errors.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Use this template to ask the user interview questions that drive product and marketing decisions. </p><div><div><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Founders, product managers, and UX researchers conducting user research to guide the development of new or improved products.</p>
<p><strong>Why this exists:</strong> Too frequently I see founders and product managers start with a solution and then ask for feedback on it (UX researchers tend to get this right). This doesn’t work. As one user interviewee told me recently, “When I first conducted user interviews all I learned was that everyone loves your product if you ask stupid questions”. </p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>Download the template I start with when creating questions for a new set of user interviews.</p>

<h2>How I Use The Template For User Interviews</h2>
<p>Here’s how I break up a 30-minute user interview:</p>
<p><strong>1. Background and rapport-building [5 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>A successful qualitative user interview should be sincere, vivid, and emotional. To achieve all three of these you need to build a solid foundation with your interviewee. When I'm on the other end of user interviews, I can always tell how experienced the interviewer is by how much they ask about me at the beginning. Experts spend more time getting to know me. We do this to build rapport and understand more about the segment we’re interviewing. For example, in my research, I’ve found that the role of a product manager varies so much between a large and small firms that they’re two completely different segments. Another thing I try to do is earn confidence from the interviewee by proving that I’m well prepared. For example, if I see that the user recently switched roles, or we have a shared connection or interest, I’ll sneak that into this portion.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Nothing. Don't skip this part. You’re about walk the tightrope between interrogation and interview; if you don’t build rapport early on, you’ll plummet into interrogation territory.</p>
<p>Do ask: Can you tell me a little about your role as a Product Manager at Acme Group?</p>
<p><strong>2. Detailed story-collecting questions [20 minutes] </strong></p>
<p>A successful user interview is one where you, as the interviewer, walk away with a collection of vivid stories. As humans, we don’t recognize issues until we talk about specific scenarios and we tend to be terrible at predicting how we will respond to future scenarios. The key to parseing these out is the follow-up questions you ask. One rule of thumb I use is the rule of five whys; try following up a user’s response with “why” until you’ve reached the core of a problem. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: What problems do you encounter when you do x?</p>
<p>Do ask: Tell me about the last time you did x.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product questions [3 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>Once I’ve collected some stories, if I have time, I’ll spend a few minutes describing the hypothesized product and asking questions about it. One of the best things you can do here is to parse out the expectations from the customer; that’s where the gold is. For example, I’ll give a somewhat vague description of the product, and the customer will say, “so does the thing do y”? Which is the perfect time to ask, “would you like it to do y? Why?” Another great question is, “what did you expect?” For example, a user sent me the following email the other day, “I signed up but I’m not quite sure if I was doing it correctly?” My response: “May I ask a question? What did you expect to see that you didn’t?” Turns out, the user expected to see a note that they would get notified when they got a match. During this portion, I'll usually ask questions on a one to ten scale because it forces the customer to examine why they gave a certain rating to something and parses out their hesitations to use the product. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: The product does x, would you use it?</p>
<p>Do ask: On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) how likely would you be to use the product? Why? On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely), how likely would you be to use the product if it did x? Why?</p>
<p><strong>4. Flywheel-building questions [2 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>By now you’ve built rapport, have some user stories, and the user has a sense of what you’re working on. My favorite questions to ask here are: is there anything I haven’t asked that you think I should be asking? And: do you have any other concerns that we haven’t already talked about? On average, two out of eight respondents will have a question here; when they do it is usually gold because it uncovers something huge that I’ve neglected. Finally, I ask if there’s anyone else that I should be interviewing. This question helps open our blinders to new segments and sometimes leads to a referral for the next user interview.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Anything else?</p>
<p>Do ask: Is there anything I haven’t asked that I should be asking? Do you have any concerns that haven’t been brought up yet? Is there anyone else that you think I should be interviewing for this research?</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, I discuss how to conduct a user interview in the blog post, <a href="https://www.userinterviewexchange.com/blog/how-to-conduct-qualitative-user-interviews">How To Conduct Qualitative User Interviews For Customer Discovery</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp">Headlamp</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a> of our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget">Inspektor Gadget</a> project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_no_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska">Nebraska</a> project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant">Octant</a> project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the <a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash">K8dash</a> project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, <a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive">Lokomotive</a>. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy to try out Headlamp</strong>: just apply the deployment manifest to your cluster and point your browser to the Headlamp service, or download and install the desktop application for Windows, Mac, or Linux.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>

<li>Steve McConnell, has a great summary of existing studies that support the 10x theory in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-10x/">“Individual Productivity Variation in Software Development”</a>. </li>
<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>NEW YORK -- 
	Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies -- raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a global health crisis.</p>
<p>
	On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 per cent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth US$5.6 million.</p>
<p>
	There was nothing illegal about this, Pfizer said: the sale took place according to rules allowing company heads to sell shares under predetermined criteria, at a date or for a price set in advance, to avoid any suspicion of insider training.</p>
<p>
	Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective.</p>
<p>
	Moderna shares have soared from $19 at the beginning of the year to a current level of $90.</p>
<p>
	The boss of Novavax, for his part, sold $4.2 million in shares on August 18, just over a month after the announcement it would receive public financing of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>
	Accountable US, a nonpartisan taxpayers' advocacy group, has calculated that from the start of the federally coordinated effort to develop vaccines on May 15 until Aug. 31, officials at five pharmaceutical companies made more than $145 million by selling shares.</p>
<h3>
	'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE'</h3>
<p>
	Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges.</p>
<p>
	It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices.</p>
<p>
	Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions.</p>
<p>
	Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears "legally questionable," according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>
	"The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade?" he asked.</p>
<p>
	Bourla, according to Pfizer, had merely re-authorized on Aug. 19 a plan for a share sale originally authorized in February, "with the same price and volume terms."</p>
<p>
	But a day after that, the company issued a statement describing the preliminary results of its clinical trials as "positive."</p>
<h3>
	'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'</h3>
<p>
	It is of course not just normal but desirable that laboratory heads should be encouraged to develop a safe and reliable vaccine as quickly as possible, Taylor said.</p>
<p>
	But "when they are going to sell their shares, they have to make sure that they are operating by the same level playing field, that they're not taking advantage of other investors by having more information," he said.</p>
<p>
	Taylor added a word of caution: "I don't think that companies have internalized the reputational risk to these trades" by selling shares even as COVID-19 cases have been spiraling upward around the world.</p>
<p>
	When a top executive needs to sell shares to pay for a yacht, a new house or his children's education, the public rarely is aware of it. But with the pandemic raging, the laboratories are under intense scrutiny.</p>
<h3>
	HONESTY WITH INVESTORS</h3>
<p>
	For Sanjai Bhagat, a professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who specializes in corporate governance, top executives should simply not be allowed to sell company shares until a year or two after they leave the company.</p>
<p>
	"If they have a lot of vested stock and stock options, then they have an incentive to get the share price as high as they can, even by not being totally honest with the investing public," he said.</p>
<p>
	Bhagat believes corporate boards should eliminate any chance of temptation.</p>
<p>
	"Not having done anything illegal is not the standard by which they should be judged," he said. "Especially in these times, people are expecting them to act responsibly."</p>
<p>
	Contacted by AFP, the SEC would not say whether it was investigating any of the lab executives.</p>
<p>
	But in an interview in May on the CNBC network, SEC chairman Jay Clayton exhorted executives to respect best practices.</p>
<p>
	"Why would you want to even raise the question that you were doing something that was inappropriate?" he asked.</p>

This is especially true for graphics meant for publication, which are held to a higher aesthetic standard. Still, most commonly used plotting software doesn't offer a straight-forward path to create clean custom layouts with nicely aligned axes.</p> <p>Therefore, the users of basically all well-known plotting solutions often have to resort to hacks, brittle manual tweaking, or even roundtrips to Illustrator to achieve the results they want. Common issues are overlaps, misalignments and lots of work to redo if the figure size ever changes.</p> <h2 id="makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy"><a href="#makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy">MakieLayout Makes Layouting Graphics Easy</a></h2> <p><a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout</a> is a layout engine that attempts to solve these issues and more. It is now part of the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/">Makie plotting ecosystem</a> for the Julia language.</p> <p>Here is a totally made up example plot showing what MakieLayout can do:</p> <p><img src="https://jkrumbiegel.github.io/assets/2020-11-15-makielayout/example_1.svg" alt="Example 1"></p> <p>Among other things, this plot features a colorbar spanning two axes horizontally while aligning perfectly with a neighboring axis, and a legend describing three grids of 3x3 subplots each. The legend is placed in its own subsection instead of right next to or within any of the small subplots. The right colorbar is specifically chosen to align with the bottom content at the outer text border in order to save white-space.</p> <p>Here's a small code example which demonstrates how simple it is to place the elements of the upper half in nested grids. </p> <pre><code>scene, layout <span>=</span> <span>layoutscene</span>(resolution <span>=</span> (<span>1200</span>, <span>1000</span>))

Tools that do allow for static layout optimizations usually break apart under interactive conditions, when figure size changes dynamically and content has to follow.</p> <h2 id="its_grids_all_the_way_down"><a href="#its_grids_all_the_way_down">It's Grids All The Way Down</a></h2> <p>MakieLayout allows users to assemble complex graphics or interactive visualizations using flexible grids that are highly customizable for the greatest creative freedom. Elements can shrink or expand to fit the available space, and are always aligned in a visually pleasing way.</p> <p>MakieLayout doesn't just use simple table layouts like CSS, e.g., because they only work well for simple box-like elements. The restriction to boxes is the main reason why researchers often struggle to make nicely aligned graphics.</p> <p>Instead, MakieLayout extends the table concept with <em>protrusions</em>, which describe the statically sized content "sticking out" of the main elements, like axis decorations. Protrusions become part of the gaps between cell columns by default and don't count when calculating aspect ratios or relative column sizes. This makes it easy to align different subplots along their axes, but also allows for unlimited tweaking, if this default mode is not the right answer.</p> <p>Grid layouts can be nested to arbitrary levels, and can follow aspect ratio, absolute, or relative sizing. This removes the need for a whole class of hacks often used to distribute elements of different sizes in visually pleasing ways.</p> <p>Legends and colorbars in MakieLayout are first-class elements that are not tied to specific axes and can be freely placed anywhere.</p> <p>The example at the beginning involved no layout-tweaking whatsoever. Elements were simply placed in appropriately nested grids, with small aesthetic adjustments of some default settings.</p> <h2 id="interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations"><a href="#interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations">Interactive and Dynamic Visualizations</a></h2> <p>Together with the interactive Makie plotting ecosystem, axes, sliders, buttons and other widgets can be combined to easily create useful applications for data visualization and exploration. The Julia language offers very high performance so interactions are smooth and responsive.</p> <p>In this short demonstration video, you can see how elements are added to and removed from a layout dynamically. Resizing the window recalculates the layout and elements are never overlapping or otherwise misaligned. Plots can be controlled with sliders and buttons, and via a textbox, dynamically calculated function plots are added by specifying the right half of the equation in valid Julia code:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5wsl0dxGhI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p> <h2 id="future_directions"><a href="#future_directions">Future Directions</a></h2> <p>As you can see, even though the Makie ecosystem is still in flux, MakieLayout can be used already to create professional and clean-looking graphics well-suited for publication. The dynamic plotting features based on Observables are easy to use and can save a lot of time when writing quick data exploration tools.</p> <p>In the future, we will focus on making the Makie ecosystem more feature complete and stable. Right now, MakieLayout has to be specifically imported, but we're planning to use it as the default infrastructure for all 2D plots, which should make using it less verbose as well. Although Makie can be compiled via PackageCompiler.jl, it is still a big goal to reduce the relatively long time to first plot, owing to the JIT compilation of Julia.</p> <p>To get started, check out the basic <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/basic-tutorial.html">Makie tutorial here</a>, and once you get the basics, have a look at the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout tutorial here</a>.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1931, a 25-year-old Kurt Gödel wrote a proof that turned mathematics upside down. The implication was so astounding, and his proof so elegant that it was...kind of funny. I wanted to share his discovery with you. Fair warning though, I’m not a mathematician; I’m a programmer. This means my understanding is intuitive and not exact. Hopefully, that will come to our advantage since I have no choice but to avoid formality 🙂. Let’s get to it.</p><p>For the last 300 years, mathematicians and scientists alike made startling discoveries, which led to one great pattern. The pattern was unification: ideas that were previously thought to be disparate and different consistently turned out to be one and the same!</p><p>Newton kicked this off for physicists when he discovered that what kept us rooted on the Earth was also what kept the Earth dancing around the sun. People thought that heat was a special type of energy, but it turned out that it could be explained with mechanics. People thought that electricity, magnetism, and light were different, but Maxwell discovered they could be explained by an electromagnetic field.</p><p>Darwin did the same for biologists. It turned out that our chins, the beautiful feathers of birds, deer antlers, different flowers, male and female sexes, the reason you like sugar so much, the reason whales swim differently...could all be explained by natural selection.</p><p>Mathematicians waged a similar battle for unification. They wanted to find the “core” principles of mathematics, from which they could derive all true theories. This would unite logic, arithmetic, and so on, all under one simple umbrella. To get a sense of what this is about, consider this question: How do we <em>know</em> that 3 is smaller than 5? Or that 1 comes before 2? Is this a “core” principle that we take on faith (the formal name for this is called an “axiom”) or can this be derived from some even more core principle? Are numbers fundamental concepts, or can they be derived from something even more fundamental?</p><p>Mathematicians made great progress in this battle for core principles. For example, a gentleman called Frege discovered that he could craft a theory of sets, which could represent just about everything. For numbers, for example, he could do something like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkyOTc0LWZhMTE3MjgwLTI4MGYtMTFlYi05MTM1LTVkYjRkZWFlZjgzYy5wbmc" alt="A demonstration of how to represent numbers with sets"></span></p><p>Here, he represents 0 the empty set. 1 as the set which contains the set for 0. 2 as the set that contains the set for 1 and 0. From this he could set a principle to get the “next” number: just wrap all previous numbers in a set. Pretty cool! Frege was able to take that and prove arithmetic rules like “1 + 1”, “numbers are infinite”, etc.</p><p>This looked formidable and cool, but Bertrand Russell came along and broke the theory in one fell swoop. </p><p>He used the rules that Frege laid out to make a valid but <em>nonsensical</em> statement. He proved something analogous to 1 + 1 = 3 <sup>1</sup>. This sounds innocuous; it was after-all just <em>one</em> statement. But nevertheless it was disastrous for a foundational theory of mathematics. If you could prove that 1 + 1 = 3, then you can’t really trust any true statement that results from this foundation. </p><p>This put mathematicians on a tail-spin. They even dubbed this period the “Foundational Crisis of Mathematics” </p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, a mathematician called Hilbert laid down some requirements for what a fundamental theory of mathematics had to look like <sup>2</sup>. He said that this theory must be a new language, with a set of rules that satisfied two primary constraints:</p><p>The theory would need to be able to prove <em>any</em> true mathematical statement. For example, imagine the statement 1 + 1 = 2. If this language can’t prove that statement, then it certainly can’t prove all of mathematics. Hilbert called this quality <strong>completeness.</strong> The language would need to be complete. </p><p>The second hard requirement, as we discussed earlier, was that it <em>could not</em> prove a false mathematical statement. If we could prove 1 + 1 = 3, then all was for naught. Hilbert called this <strong>consistency.</strong> The language would need to be consistent.</p><p>Bertrand Russell, the gentleman who broke Frege’s theory, worked together with Alfred North Whitehead to develop a theory of their own. They labored for years to craft an immense volume of work, called Principia Mathematica <sup>3</sup>.</p><p>They started by writing a new language (let’s call it PM) with a few simple rules. They took those rules,  and proceeded to prove a bunch of things. Russell and Whitehead took almost nothing on faith. For example, let’s look at this almost-impossible-to-read proof over here (don’t worry, you don’t need to understand the syntax for this essay):</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkzMDA0LTA0Y2MwNzgwLTI4MTAtMTFlYi05ZGJkLTRkMTlmYmQxMDM2My5wbmc" alt="An example, very hard-to-read proof from Principia Mathematica"></span></p><p>This proof showed that “1 + 1”, does indeed equal “2”. It took 2 volumes to get here.</p><p>Their language was dense and the work laborious, but they kept on proving a whole bunch of different truths in mathematics, and so far as anyone could tell at the time, there were no contradictions. It was imagined that at least in theory you could take this foundation and eventually expand it past mathematics: could you encode in pure logic how a dog behaves, or how humans think?</p><p>It certainly looked like Principia Mathematica could serve as the foundational theory for Mathematics. Until Gödel came along. </p><p>He proved that Principia Mathematica <em>did indeed have</em> true mathematical statements which <em>could not be proven</em> in the language. Principia Mathematica was incomplete.</p><p>This was startling, but his proof went even further. He showed that the entire enterprise behind Hilbert’s Program — to find a formal foundation for mathematics — could <em>never</em> work.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that a person could really prove that something can “never” happen — imagine if someone told you that we could never travel farther than our solar system — you’d look at them with suspicion.</p><p>Yet here Gödel was...a 25 year-old who proved beyond a doubt that this enterprise was impossible. He did this by showing that if a language could represent numbers, then unprovable statements would necessarily pop up.</p><p>Let’s think about that for a second: Numbers seem so quaint and easy to prove —  just “1”, “2”, “3”...so on. People thought we could eventually write down how humans think — imagine how shocked they must have been to see that we couldn’t prove all truths about...numbers.</p><p>Let’s see how Gödel did it.</p><p>Now Russel and Whitehead’s language was hard to read. There’s no harm done in changing some of their symbols around. Let’s map their language to something more amenable to programmers: Lisp! </p><p>You can imagine that Russell and Whitehead came up with a lisp-like language. Here’s how their syntax looked:</p><p>First, they had a few symbols for arithmetic.</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>zero</p></td><td><p><code>0</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>next</p></td><td><p>the next successor</p></td><td><p><code>(next 0)</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>plus</p></td><td><p><code>(+ 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>*</p></td><td><p>times</p></td><td><p><code>(* 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>=</p></td><td><p>equals</p></td><td><p><code>(= 0 (* 0 (next 0)))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Just from these symbols, they could represent all natural numbers. If they proved that the symbol <code>0</code> worked like 0. and the symbol <code>next</code> worked like a successor function, then <code>(next 0)</code> could represent 1, <code>(next (next 0))</code> could represent 2, and so on. </p><p>Here’s how they could write <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>+</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)) </span>
<span>   (</span><span>next</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>Now, for the purpose of this essay, I’ll add one rule. If you ever see me using a natural number inside PM-Lisp other than 0 (i.e “15”), you can imagine it’s shorthand to writing <code>(next (next (next ...))))</code> that many times. In this case, “15” means <code>next</code> applied to 0, 15 times</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>&lt;natural-number&gt;</code></p></td><td><p><code>(next (next ...))</code> applied to <code>0</code> <code>&lt;natual-number&gt;</code> times</p></td><td><div><p><code>3</code></p><p><em>means</em> <code>(next (next (next 0)))</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(Next (pun-intended)), they came up with some symbols to represent logic: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>not</p></td><td><p>not</p></td><td><p><code>(not (= 0 1))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>or</p></td><td><p>or</p></td><td><p><code>(or (= 0 1) (not (= 0 1)))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>when</p></td><td><p>when ... then ..</p></td><td><div><p><code>(when 0 (or 0 1))</code></p><p><em>when 0, then there is either 0 or 1</em></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><p>there-is</p></td><td><p>there is ... such that ...</p></td><td><p><code>(there-is x (= 4 (* x 2))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These symbols map closely to the logical statements we are used to in programming. The most unusual one is <code>there-is</code>. Let’s see one of those for an example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>there-is</span><span> x (</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> (</span><span>*</span><span> x </span><span>2</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>This is making a statement, that there is some number <code>x</code>, such that <code>(* x 2)</code> equals 4.  Well, that is indeed true: <code>x = 2</code>. That’s pretty cool — we’ve just made a general arithmetic statement. </p><p>Where did the <code>x</code> come from though? Oops, we need to account for that in our language:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>a...z, A...Z</p></td><td><p>variable</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In order to represent general truths, Russell and Whitehead introduced variables. Here’s how they could derive <code>and</code> for example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>not</span><span> (</span><span>or</span><span> (</span><span>not</span><span> A) (</span><span>not</span><span> B)))</span></code></pre><p>When this statement is <code>true</code>, both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> must be true! </p><p>Very cool. One more trick for our essay. To make it a bit easier to read, sometimes I’ll introduce new symbols. They won’t actually be a part of the language, but it can make good shorthand for us in the essay</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Form</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(def &lt;name&gt; &lt;formula&gt;)</code></p></td><td><p>define <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> to represent <code>&lt;formula&gt;</code></p></td><td><div><p><code>(def and (not (or (not A) (not B)))</code></p><p><em>same as</em> <code>(and &lt;var-a&gt; &lt;var-b&gt;...)</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now we can write <code>(and 1 2)</code> 🙂</p><p>All we saw above were <em>symbols.</em> They had no meaning yet. </p><p>Russell and Whitehead needed to prove that <code>0</code> works like zero, and that <code>=</code> works like equals. In order to breathe life into those symbols, they started off with some core principles — the axioms. </p><p>Here’s what they chose: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Axiom</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p p) p)</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or apples, then apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when p (or p q))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples, then either apples or bananas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p q) (or q p))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or bananas, then either bananas or apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p (or q r)) (or q (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples, bananas, or pears, then either bananas, apples, or pears</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (when q r) (when (or p q) (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples are a fruit, then bananas or apples implies bananas or fruits</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That’s it. This is all we needed to take them on faith for. They took these rules and laboriously combined them in intricate ways to derive everything else. </p><p>For example, here’s how they derived <code>=</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> = (</span><span>and</span><span> (</span><span>when</span><span> A B) (</span><span>when</span><span> B A)))</span></code></pre><p>If A implies B, and B implies A, they <em>must</em> be equal! Imagine this done for hundreds and hundreds of pages. </p><p>Note something essential here: their rules are so precise that there is no room for human judgement; a computer could run them. This was a key component for …</p></span></p></div>

You can use WPGraphQL in production with the confidence that it is secure, well documented, and supported full time and long term.</p><p>If you’re new to the WPGraphQL community, you may ask yourself, “But WordPress already has the REST API. What’s different about using WPGraphQL?” </p><p>Well, when you use WPGraphQL to turn your WordPress site into a GraphQL server, multiple resources can be fetched at the same time. And by design you get back the exact data you asked for, nothing more, nothing less. In addition to being easier to work with compared to the REST API, data loading with GraphQL is faster and more efficient. (Read more: “<a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api/" data-type="docs" data-id="864">WPGraphQL vs. WP REST API</a>“)</p><p>If you are upgrading to 1.0 or another version, see <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases">the release notes</a> for information on breaking changes and preparing your site. If you are new, <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">start at the homepage</a> and follow our step-by-step docs. </p><p>In this post I want to talk about the journey to 1.0, why it took so long to get to 1.0, and a look at what’s next for WPGraphQL. But before diving into that, I want to also announce some other fun stuff that has also come to life along with this release.</p><ul><li>WPGraphQL is now available on the WordPress.org repository</li><li>New WPGraphQL.com website</li><li>WPGraphQL Swag available on the Gatsby Swag Store</li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg">WPGraphQL on WordPress.org</a><span id="wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg"></span></h2><p>The WordPress.org plugin repository has long been the default distribution mechanism for WordPress plugins. Prior to today, developers had to install WPGraphQL using Composer and installing from <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">packagist</a>, or by downloading from <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Github</a>. </p><p>Now, users can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql">install WPGraphQL directly from WordPress.org’s plugin directory</a>.</p><p>We believe that distributing WPGraphQL on the WordPress.org plugin repository should make it easier for users to find and install and keep updated.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#new-wpgraphqlcom-website">New WPGraphQL.com website</a><span id="new-wpgraphqlcom-website"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL.com has been re-built from the ground up. </p><p>Before today, WPGraphQL had 2 primary domains: </p><ul><li><code>WPGraphQL.com</code>, a “traditional” WordPress site using WordPress as the CMS <em>and </em>the theme layer</li><li><code>docs.wpgraphql.com</code>, a <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> site using Markdown files in a Github repository for the content. </li></ul><p>Now, instead of splitting some content in Markdown files on Github and some content in WordPress, WPGraphQL.com now uses WordPress as the CMS for all content, and and has a Gatsby front-end powered by the new <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/">Gatsby Source WordPress</a> plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGatsby</a> and of course <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGraphQL</a>. </p><p>We’ll be releasing tutorials and videos in the coming weeks and months walking through how various parts of the site were created to provide inspiration for you to build great things with this stack as well, but for now you can draw inspiration from the repository this site is built from: <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com">https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com</a></p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-swag">WPGraphQL Swag</a><span id="wpgraphql-swag"></span></h2><p>Now, possibly the most exciting thing about this whole announcement, is the fact that you can now <a href="https://store.gatsbyjs.org/">get WPGraphQL Swag from the Gatsby swag store</a>.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#the-journey-to-10">The Journey to 1.0</a><span id="the-journey-to-10"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL was started in November 2016 (with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/commit/6723f8cdf16b85cc827fe7ec1cbcb10aa02fa616">no commit message</a>&nbsp;🤣&nbsp;) and has come a long way in that time.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.wpgraphql.com/static/770921a32b9578c1779a53ddb653c9f4/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-10.47.30-AM.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px"><figcaption>Screenshot of the “Initial Commit” in Github</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the end of 2017 the codebase was pretty robust and provided a Schema to interact with many parts of WordPress. Posts, Pages, Custom Post Types, Tags, Categories, Custom Taxonomies, Comments and Nav Menus.</p><p><a href="https://qz.com/">Qz.com</a>&nbsp;was the first site to go to production with WPGraphQL, even before&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;was using it in production! A few years later and they are still running on WPGraphQL! You can learn more about the early days of their stack from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvkDdYAA64A">this presentation</a>&nbsp;from December 2017.</p><p>In early 2018, my team took WPGraphQL into production on a network of 54 large WordPress sites. WPGraphQL was used as a syndication engine for our network of newspapers. Unlike most GraphQL users, we didn’t initially have a JavaScript or native mobile UI that was using GraphQL, we had PHP WordPress servers syndicating content and GraphQL solved a lot of pain points we had been facing when using REST.</p><p>By the end of 2018, more than 100 sites were using WPGraphQL in some way.</p><p>Now, WPGraphQL seems to be running all over the place!</p><p>This is a non-comprehensive list of sites using WPGraphQL in production in some way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://denverpost.com/">DenverPost.com</a></li><li><a href="https://twincities.com/">TwinCities.com</a></li><li><a href="https://mercurynews.com/">MercuryNews.com</a></li><li><a href="https://siliconvalley.com/">SiliconValley.com</a></li><li><a href="https://qz.com/">QZ.com</a></li><li><a href="https://meowwolf.com/">MeowWolf.com</a></li><li><a href="https://theplayerstribune.com/">ThePlayersTribune.com</a></li><li><a href="https://apollographql.com/blog">ApolloGraphQL.com</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.creditkarma.com/">blog.creditkarma.com</a></li></ul><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Packagist.org</a>&nbsp;as of June 30, 2020 there were nearly 50,000 installs of WPGraphQL in the wild, and as of November 2020 Packagist reports 71,573 installs.</p><p>In 2019 Credit Karma paid for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/pwning-wordpress-graphql/">security audit</a>&nbsp;on the plugin and all reported issues were resolved.</p><p>It’s safe to say, WPGraphQL is production ready!</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#so-why-the-wait-for-10">So, why the wait for 1.0?</a><span id="so-why-the-wait-for-10"></span></h2><p>So, if WPGraphQL has been production ready for such a long time, why is is still not 1.0?</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#breaking-changes-wordpress">Breaking Changes &amp; WordPress</a><span id="breaking-changes-wordpress"></span></h3><p>The WordPress ecosystem has a strong commitment to backward compatibility. This means that once functionality is introduced to a WordPress plugin, it often sticks around&nbsp;<em>forever</em>.</p><p>With that in mind, before tagging WPGraphQL 1.0, I wanted so badly to be at a place with the codebase &amp; Schema that I could no longer predict anymore breaking changes. </p><p>I wanted the GraphQL Schema to be “perfect” before tagging it 1.0, because I knew that whatever would be in the WPGraphQL Schema at 1.0 would need to remain in the Schema&nbsp;<em>forever</em>. The WordPress community is used to things working the same way “forever” and I wanted to play along.</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#breaking-changes-wpgraphql">Breaking Changes &amp; WPGraphQL</a><span id="breaking-changes-wpgraphql"></span></h3><p>The reality is that for software to get better, sometimes it needs to make breaking changes. </p><p>WPGraphQL will never be perfect, and it will&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to occasionally break to make things better. </p><p>For example, when the GraphQL Specification updates to include Input Unions or Interfaces that can implement other Interfaces, WPGraphQL will need to break to keep up with the GraphQL Specification. </p><p>There would be no way to keep GraphQL as we know it today and take advantage of tomorrow’s GraphQL Spec without breaking.</p><p><strong>WPGraphQL turning 1.0 isn’t a statement that there will never be breaking changes, instead it’s a statement of stability and long term support.</strong></p><p>So, how will breaking changes be handled in a post-1.0 world?</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</a><span id="semantic-versioning"></span></h3><p>WPGraphQL has been following&nbsp;<a href="https://semver.org/">Semver</a>&nbsp;practices for a few years. We will continue to follow Semver and let version numbers communicate meaning.

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is probably the most unintuitive scientific theory in the history of humankind—nothing behaves like we are used to. In this essay, we will try to get back some intuition of how to think about quantum mechanics, more specifically the quantum random walk. No worries, there are going to be <em>no equations</em>—this is not a scientific paper. The main purpose of this essay is to make the reader curious by showing how weird our reality is and how this knowledge might help us in the future.</p><p>Most people are familiar with the classical random walk which is a mathematical framework used to describe a lot of phenomena—e.g. Stock-prices and Brownian motion. The quantum random walk is less known and not as useful for explanations, but there are some interesting fields it might get more important in. The most notable cases are quantum computing—specifically Grover’s Algorithm—and quantum biology. The later field is the study of how and why quantum mechanics is important for explaining biology and it is still a pretty new and often controversial field.</p><h2 id="classical">Classical</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">classical random walk</a> in one dimension can be thought of as flipping a coin and going one step forward (+1) if it shows heads and one step backward (-1) if it shows tails. This is the simplest version of the random walk but it is sufficient to illustrate some important concepts.</p><p>The first thing to note is that probabilities approach a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> (Gaussian). After one coin flip—T=1 steps—we find ourselves with the probability of 1/2 at 1 and with the probability of 1/2 at -1. After T=2 steps we find ourselves with a probability of 1/4 at 2, with the probability of 1/4 at -2, and with the probability of 1/2 at 0 (Figure 3). By continuing this sequence, we can see the normal distribution emerging.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586508603527-Q4JJL2080G6VZWKF1M1Q/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIjS6q4cv5cYFkTz_escvjFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVHk1kd5ZhDKaoPBq5dMMgNiLIFqjsmkQkqMmAV2uYMQkty480UlKOY0DP3Mqxn-Omk/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w" alt="The random walk can be visualized with Galton’s Board."></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509218902-IQ5G4Z3K1RGD1VFKIV0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC4WqmtwEkHAKs-GAMAt7IJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIMY-uRSxFfrlmpPcZO_V5RxeWyHosL0CxVv30qiNAUhM/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.00.08.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a classical random walk"></figure><p>One important but counter-intuitive fact is that after T steps the average distance from our starting point (0) is not 0. You might expect that if we always move +1 or -1, we would on average not move way from the start (0), but that is not the case. The average distance from our start after T steps is roughly √(T). We will not prove this fact since I promised not to use equations but we will at least see why 0 is the wrong answer.</p><p>The distance from our starting point can never be negative—a distance is only ever be positive. Even if we find ourselves after T=2 at the point -2, the distance to our starting point (0) is not -2 but 2. Put differently, it does not matter in which direction you go, you cannot be -5 meters away from your home (try it at home). Starting from this point, the interested reader can figure out (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#One-dimensional_random_walk">or lookup</a>) why the average distance is of the order of √(T).</p><h2 id="quantum">Quantum</h2><p>For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">quantum random walk</a>, we need what I will call a “quantum coin”; it is a fair coin that just like the classical one has the probability of 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. Note that this quantum coin does not exist and in reality and the “coin flip” is a mathematically defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation_(quantum_mechanics)">unitary operation</a> manipulating the state of a system—spin—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>. We will use the balanced—fair—quantum coin named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk#Discrete_time">Hadamard coin</a> for our example. The most important thing to understand here is that we have defined this coin to be fair. When we flip it, we get heads half of the time and tails the other half of the time. As with our classical coin, we will move one step forward (+1) if it lands on heads and one step backward (-1) if it lands on tails. After T=1 flips (or steps) we will be at 1 with the probability of 1/2 and at -1 with the probability of 1/2. So far, so good—everything is behaving “classically.”</p><p>Now comes the weird part, instead of measuring after each step, we will measure only at the end—let us say, after T=5 flips. This represents, in a way, the quantum version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">Galton’s Board</a>. If everything behaved classically, it would not make a difference if we looked—i.e. measured—after every step or just at the end, but since we are dealing with weird quantum mechanics it makes a huge difference. The probability distribution looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509307347-UCS5QF91ZOP00Q86H56T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJOa5YPqCmGvzx7mCN2r0EdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIsiIvZpik36d-7psP9EKVUlUUi2YiCCZOvvpVrdTT-CE/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.01.06.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a quantum walk"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586526747838-SHOBBHF1UHDH1H2UI1LD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOLb81ARpkFxFMv5Mbr56oVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEEkvzdRL4CfH2OmtAD12M-DuTV5gn_3pnKAHtbVSWOI91lH3P2bFZvTItROhWrBJ0/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution visualized"></figure><p>Keep in mind that to measure the probabilities for T=5, we are only allowed to measure after those 5 flips—never in-between. To get the probabilities for the other steps we need to measure only after e.g. T=3 but we cannot continue the experiment afterward and measure T=5.</p><p>Looking at the table (Figure 4), we can see a couple of interesting things. First, the distribution starts to differ from the classical one after T=3. Second, the distribution is not symmetric; in this case, it is skewed to the left (negative) side. This is the case because we started with the initial state “spin down”. In our coin analogy, this corresponds to which side is facing upwards <em>before</em> you flip the coin. Take a moment to appreciate how unbelievable this is.</p><p>We defined the coin so it has exactly 1/2 chance of landing on heads and 1/2 of landing on tails; and if we look after one flip, it works perfectly and it does not matter in which initial condition the coin was—i.e. which side was facing upward before the flip. But if we only look after T=5 flips, it matters a lot in which initial condition the coin was; it is suddenly important which side of the coin was facing upwards before we flipped it. This is because of a phenomenon at the heart of Quantum Mechanics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference">interference</a>.</p><p>If we do the experiment with our system having “spin up” we will get the same distribution skewed to the right. To get a symmetrical distribution, we have to put the system into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a> of the two states “spin up” and “spin down.” Superposition means that the system is in both states at the same time and only when we “measure” it, the system decides the state. In our analogy, we have to prepare the coin so that it lies with heads up and tails up at the same time. This is, obviously, not possible with a real coin but doable with a quantum system.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586529134138-8UG2L02UHXH0YUZI861S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGsLnSpN9SmgRY0kKOgjdudZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFCeGs_oZuelCVw0HtcXhz3OCHUHA_lcJEJorkwU3xVcmbSd6kfRtgWHgNMDgGnmDY/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a Hamard walk with a superposition of initial conditions"></figure><p>The most interesting and useful feature of the quantum walk is that in contrast to the classical walk, the expected distance from the origin is not √(T) but T. This means that a quantum walk is quadratically faster than a classical random walk. In T flips—steps—we expect to find ourselves at the distance T from the start. This is incredible. One cannot understand this feature by thinking “classically.” We can only imagine that the quantum random walk is not going +1 <em>or</em> -1 at each step but rather <em>both</em> at the same time and the system only decides on one alternative when being measured (this mixture of superposition and interference makes everything extremely counter intuitive). Now, let us see why is it useful to know about this weird quantum random walk.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: another big difference to the classical random walk can be seen by adding an absorption barrier. While the classical walk has the probability of p=1 to be eventually absorbed, the quantum walk has, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">this paper</a>, a chance of escaping to infinity.)</p><h2 id="grover-s-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h2><p>Searching through lists and sorting them is one of the most popular tasks computers nowadays perform. Finding fast search and sorting algorithms is getting increasingly important because the amount of available data is skyrocketing and unsearchable or unsorted databases are mostly useless. This is where—in theory—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> comes in; it is a quantum algorithm for searching an item in an unsorted list. Only in theory because a good enough quantum computer has not been build yet and scaling up from the ones we have already build is not trivial.</p><p>If you want to find a particular item in a list with N items classically, you need to check all N items—N evaluations—because the item you are searching for could be the last in the list. (If you are sure that the item is in the list, the correct number of evaluations is N-1, but this does not matter much here.) This means searching through an unsorted database with N entries takes—classically—N steps. However, with Grover’s quantum algorithm—which can be viewed as a quantum random walk—it takes √(N) steps. It allows for the same quadric speedup as the quantum random walk. For large databases—lists with big N— this can mean a lot fewer evaluations.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: it is sadly (or luckily?) not possible to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time with this algorithm.)</p><h2 id="photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</h2><p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge</a>, Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili argue that quantum physics is needed to explain biological phenomena. One of the most important processes in biology is photosynthesis which, according to the authors, probably relies on the quantum random walk since such efficient transportation seems difficult to explain otherwise. However, quantum biology is a new and often controversial field and I am sadly not in the position to judge the credibility of this claim because my knowledge of biology is rudimentary at best.</p><p>Some people believe that uncovering this mechanism of nature can help us build technologies that more efficiently convert the energy of sunlight into electric energy and I hope they are right. For those who are interested, I can highly recommend the already mentioned book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge.</a></p><h2 id="curious">Curious?</h2><p>I hope this essay has shown the reader how weird our world at the smallest scale behaves without asking for many technical prerequisites. I have done my best to keep the explanations as intuitive as possible which is why I had to omit many details. For the interested reader, I would suggest “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">Quantum random walks: An introductory overview</a>” by J. Kempe as a further reading—it is also the source for most of the figures. Keep in mind that you will need a decent amount of mathematical and physical background knowledge to understand it though. Having said this, I hope that my essay made some people curious about our world and that is all I can ask for.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

		<p>From The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/">The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse: A historian believes he has discovered iron laws that predict the rise and fall of societies. He has bad news.</a></p>
<p>Turchin’s core argument ,based on data mining and mathematical modeling, is that an overproduction of elites will lead to societal unrest and collapse in the US, that should unfold soon. This occurs in cycles of 50 or so years.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Certain aspects of this cyclical view require relearning portions of American history, with special attention paid to the numbers of elites. The industrialization of the North, starting in the mid-19th century, Turchin says, made huge numbers of people rich. The elite herd was culled during the Civil War, which killed off or impoverished the southern slaveholding class, and during Reconstruction, when America experienced a wave of assassinations of Republican politicians. (The most famous of these was the assassination of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, by a lawyer who had demanded but not received a political appointment.) It wasn’t until the Progressive reforms of the 1920s, and later the New Deal, that elite overproduction actually slowed, at least for a time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
This oscillation between violence and peace, with elite over­production as the first horseman of the recurring American apocalypse, inspired Turchin’s 2020 prediction. In 2010, when Nature surveyed scientists about their predictions for the coming decade, most took the survey as an invitation to self-promote and rhapsodize, dreamily, about coming advances in their fields. Turchin retorted with his prophecy of doom and said that nothing short of fundamental change would stop another violent turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree with his forecasts at all, and I take the opposite position that  America is in a prolonged   period of  prosperity,  peace, and  dominance (esepcially relative to the rest of the world since 2008) that may last indefinitely. By investing in US stocks, you are making an indirect bet in this trend continuing, but if Turchin is right, the best investment would probably be treasury bonds, which are yielding very little now (so there is very little profit potential). But I can say with 100% certainty that my forecast is way more likely to be accurate than Turchin’s. Shorting the market is not an option , owing to path tendency and possible insolvency from being ‘too early’. </p>
<p>Turchin blames an ‘over-production of elites’ for impending unrest, yet it is not so much that all college grads aspire to elite positions but rather seek the higher wages and nicer lifestyle that a college degree bestows. And as long as the college wage premium keep widening, we should expect more college grads and higher tuition costs. If the premium was to suddenly contract, then college enrolment would fall and there would be fewer production of these elites. </p>
<p>Even if empires cyclically rise and fall within certain fixed or predictable intervals, there are many factors protecting the US from such collapse, and when such factors are combined make the possibly far more remote than quantitative historical analysis would suggest:</p>
<p>1. Considerable ethnic, cultural, religious, and economic diversity , which makes it harder to foment revolution and increases political and economic stability even if such diversity leads to local tensions, such as black-on-white crime. </p>
<p>Vox Day and others argue that increased diversity will lead to unrest and the break-up of America, but I have <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/does-diversity-proximity-lead-to-war-probably-not-as-far-as-the-us-is-concerned/">argued</a> it is a prophylactic against such unrest. Civil wars and revolution are typically engendered by homogenous groups against a second group cut from the same ethnic and racial cloth. The Revolutionary War pitted New England against Britain. The Civil War pitted Anglo Protestants up North against Anglo Protestants from the South. The Iranian revolution pitted anti-Western Iranian religious fundamentalists against pro-Western Iranian rulers.   </p>
<p>Also, if diversity is supposed to be destabilizing, why would elites push for it? Why would elites support policy that would lead to their undoing and loss of power and wealth as the US collapses due to war arising from such diversity? That makes no sense. This is an obvious logical contradiction that many dissidents such as Vox and others cannot account for. </p>
<p>Although small, homogenous countries can prosper for a long time (the Nordic countries for example), I believe that homogeneity makes such countries more vulnerable if the right conditions are met (economic downturns, war, indebtedness, inflation, etc.). This was the case during the French and Russian revolutions, in which debts due to war caused high unemployment and basic needs not being met for large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>2. Highly productive and large ‘smart fraction’ (discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/the-iq-debate/">earlier</a>) under optimal economic and social conditions, which is a major contributing factor for America’s economic dominance and strength, especially since 2008. </p>
<p>3. Large geographic size. Similar to #1, this makes it hard for aggrieved, disenfranchised groups to collectively rise up, as everyone is literally all spread out.</p>
<p>4. Unparalleled, unrivaled  military and economic dominance relative to the rest of the developed world, even China. The British Empire, during its height in the early 20th century, was in  relatively much weaker position than the US is in now, and faced major competitors such as France, Germany, The Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, etc. The only major possible competitor or comparable strength is China, which does not have imperial ambitions. </p>
<p>5. Foreign competitors have no imperial ambitions, unlike centuries ago when Spain, France, the Netherlands, England, Germany, Portugal, Ottoman Empire, etc. were all vying for control (especially of India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America):</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/debitage.net/humangeography/images/Colonialism_1914.png"></p>
<p>In spite of all the sabre rattling, China has no imperial ambitions.  So many people are predicting an imminent ‘clash of the civilizations’ between the US and China. I think nothing of that sort will happen and there will be continued peace, with the occasional tough talk and posturing and threats such as Trump’s tariffs and ‘trade war’ (which was more media hype than a war) that gets a lot of media coverage, but nothing substantive happens. In regard to purported expansionism, China has done very little actual expansion. The annexation of Tibet was 70 years ago. The last incident of expansion could technically be in in 1997 when Hong Kong was transferred to China from Britain.</p>
<p>6. America’s large bureaucracy and its constitutional republic composed to hundreds of Congressmen and Senators creates a lot of redundancy and limits the damage any one individual can do, unlike aristocracies and nobilities, which are more centralized and have point of failure. Yet at the same time, in spite of this large federal government and also numerous state governments, the private sector has a lot of autonomy, with the federal government only interceding during crisis but otherwise tending to keep an hands-off approach, although the Covid shutdowns are a possible exception to this.  </p>
<p>7. A large middle class and high standards of living, further making revolution and mass unrest unlikely even if there are occasional outbursts such as BLM protests. </p>
<p>I don’t think Turchin’s research is of any useful predictive value. I don’t know why his ideas have gotten so much attention when there are so many obvious methodological problems and dubious assumptions, such as that history must cycle or that empires must fall. The problem with making such inferences based on historical trends and patterns is that the circumstances for each country, throughout history, are unique and it is hard to generalize. You can say “going back 2000 years, empires and regimes on average last 200-400 years,” but there is no immutable law that says it must be less than 400 years. It can be 4,000 or 40,000 under the right circumstances, for all we know.  Because the conditions are so vague and the time frames are so long, it is hard to quantifiably and objectively test Turchin’s ideas. Mathematics typically tries to make things precise, yet history is imprecise in nature, so attempting to merge these things probably yields the worst of both. </p>

It’s an engaged community with lots of smart, motivated product people.</p><p>My early successes with posts for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jmofq3/every_product_needs_a_niche_heres_the_criteria_i/">Step Two</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jqz961/how_i_validated_whether_people_will_use_and_pay/">Step Three</a> show that the community appreciates my content.</p><h4>Twitter</h4><p>Twitter is full of interesting and influential people sharing thoughts and having public conversations. And they’re all accessible - just 280 characters away.</p><h4>LinkedIn</h4><p>LinkedIn is a content-deficient platform - there’s more demand for quality content than supply.</p><p>And pretty much all product and engineering leaders spend time on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">Feel free to connect</a> and shoot me a message! 🙂</p><h4>SEO</h4><p>In the early days, I can hustle my way to 20-30% month-over-month growth.</p><p>But when 20% growth requires adding 20+ new companies, I need to be able to rely on more scalable channels.</p><p>I’m optimistic that SEO will be my best sustainable growth driver in the long-term.</p><h4>The product</h4><p>Eventbrite’s product was inherently viral. A product where employees get value by inviting their coworkers has the same potential for (intra-company) virality.</p><h3>🚗 Every channel needs a strategy</h3><p>A channel without a strategy is like a car without gas - it won’t take you anywhere.</p><p>I have two initial growth hypotheses:</p><h4>1.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he wind shifts. The stench of rotten eggs makes it nearly impossible to breathe and the hot fog clouds my view. I hold my breath and close my eyes, imagining the fog growing thicker, crushing me. Then without warning the wind clears and Iâ€™m enveloped once again in the cold, dry air. The heat feels like a lost dream. I shiver as I analyze my surroundings.</p>

<p>Before me lies a steaming blue spring with concentric rings of green, yellow and dark red. I turn around to see another pool. But the rising fog is so dense, I can only guess at the existence of blue water below. Sometimes I glimpse bubbles boiling from some unknown source. The pools are a small sampling of the 10,000 geothermal features that dot Yellowstoneâ€™s caldera and hint at a mysterious hot spot beneath the crust.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s this alien landscape that makes it surprisingly easy to believe that northwestern Wyoming sits directly above a supervolcano—a behemoth far more powerful than your average volcano, with the capacity to eject more than 240 cubic miles of material.</p>
<p>But why do scientists believe there is a supervolcano hidden below? When I asked Henry Heasler, a park geologist at Yellowstone this question, he waxed philosophical. â€œGood science is nothing more than a progress report,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s what we know at a certain time with the data that we have.â€�</p>
<p>Scientists provided one of the most impressive&nbsp;progress reports yet:&nbsp;They peered deep beneath the Earthâ€™s surface and created the first three-dimensional image of the supervolcanoâ€™s plumbing. Although they had already imaged a plume, which brings molten rock up from deep below the mantle to a region about 60 kilometers below the surface, and a magma chamber about 10 kilometers below the surface, the new work had found the missing link between the two.</p>
<p>A second, 11,200-cubic-mile magma chamber connects the plume to the shallower magma chamber. Itâ€™s 4.5 times larger than its shallow companion and has enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times.</p>
<p>Hsin-Hua Huang, a seismologist from the University of Utah and his colleagues used earthquake data to capture this astonishing image. Itâ€™s similar to an ultrasound, said Heasler. â€œWe have the skin of a surface—of a person—but we want to see whatâ€™s inside.â€� When earthquakes travel through dense, hot spots they slow down. So if a seismic wave reaches a sensor later than expected, scientists know thereâ€™s a low-velocity, and hence denser and hotter, region hidden deep within the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œIf we were just using one pathway—so one earthquake and one seismometer—we couldnâ€™t be able to tell where along that path that low velocity body was. Weâ€™d have no idea,â€� said co-author Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah. Thatâ€™s where multiple earthquakes and sensors come into play. Huangâ€™s team used 4,849 earthquakes, originating from all parts of the earth, plus 80 seismographs across Yellowstone and beyond, to create a rough three-dimensional picture.</p>
<p>Their study was also the first to combine both worldwide and local earthquakes. Distant earthquakes allow scientists to image deep structures (any earthquakes originating under India or China will first travel through the Earthâ€™s core before reaching the U.S.) and local earthquakes allow for shallow structures. Combining the two let the team image the deep magma chamber for the first time. Given that natural earthquakes, however, are relatively rare events—even in one of the most active areas in the world—they had to collect 30 years worth of data.</p>
<p>But seismic tomography isnâ€™t the only way to peer deep underground. GPS satellites can scour the area searching for any ground movement; gravity satellites can look for any changes in the density below; and ground instruments can sample the heat and gases rising from the geothermal features.</p>

<p><span>A</span>ll methods point to a supervolcano thatâ€™s very much alive. From 1976 to 1984, GPS satellite data showed that the caldera floor was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB13p13753/abstract">swelling upwardgravity data</a>. To a satellite orbiting directly above the inflow, the Earth will seem to pull on it a little less than expected. Meanwhile ground instruments measured increasing heat and gases rising from the active features.</p>
<p>Then from 1985 to 1995 the caldera sunk back down about 5.5 inches. Magma was either moving out of the system laterally or the shallow reservoir was simply cooling and contracting, letting gases seep through the surface. Later measurements show that the caldera floor is continuing to swell and sink. But scientists still donâ€™t understand the complex interplay between the supervolcanoâ€™s moving parts.</p>
<p>â€œI think our next step—hopefully—is to be able to look at some smaller scale features of how these bigger features are connected to each other,â€� said Farrell. If scientists can determine how the large magma chambers interact with each other, they will better understand how fluids and heat move the Earth. â€œThen we can start looking at how long it would take for enough material to get from the deep to the shallow [reservoirs] and maybe where we are in the volcanic cycle of eruptions. But weâ€™re not quite there yet.â€�</p>
<p>Although past eruptions dot the Earthâ€™s surface from Oregon to Wyoming, itâ€™s hard to infer anything about a future eruption. And Farrell isnâ€™t convinced another super-eruption will happen at all. â€œThe system might be dying,â€� he said. â€œThe Yellowstone hot spot is moving into thicker, colder continental crust. And it takes a lot more energy to burn through that crust than it did the thinner crust that itâ€™s been burning through for the last 17 million years.â€�</p>
<p>But as I watch Yellowstoneâ€™s surface boil over before my very eyes itâ€™s hard to believe that the system deep beneath my feet might one day fade away. And as a geyser before me erupts, shooting steam and water tens of feet into the air, I have to wonder if itâ€™s instead slowly building toward another super-eruption. After all, despite Farrellâ€™s uncertainty, he continued to say: â€œItâ€™s happened in the past, it could happen in the future.â€�</p>

        <p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get C up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal C “runtime” (typically called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>Compared to other popular programming languages, which require substantial
runtime machinery to operate (e.g: Java’s virtual machine, Go’s garbage
collector, etc…), C’s extremely minimal approach to language design has
allowed it to run on just about any platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while C is effectively dependency free at the <em>language</em> level,
the same can’t be said about its <em>standard library</em>.</p>

<p>Note: the original title of this post was “C Is Not Dependency Free”. This
title didn’t reflect the actual message I was trying to convey (namely, that
it can be tricky for beginners getting started with freestanding C to know
which methods they can and can’t use), and was disingenuous at best, and
actively misleading at worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ll be focusing exclusively on C, though it should be
noted that everything here applies to C++ as well. While not a strict superset
of C, C++ inherits most of C’s language design and standard library, making it
equally susceptible to the issues outlined below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owing to its strong UNIX heritage, the C standard library includes many
functions and features which assume the existence of some sort of underlying OS.
For example, even the humble and ubiquitous <code>printf</code> function relies on the
existence of the <code>write</code> syscall, the idea of file descriptors, the <code>stdout</code>
stream, etc…</p>
<p>When writing bare-metal C code, beginners often absent-mindedly
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> in an effort to do some quick-and-dirty <code>printf</code> debugging.
Unfortunately, while it might appear as though everything is working fine when
compiling individual translation units, things will inevitably come crashing
down at link time. Raise your hand if you’ve ever been hit with a linker error
that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-writer.o): In function `_write_r':
    writer.c:(.text._write_r+0x20): undefined reference to `_write'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-readr.o): In function `_read_r':
    readr.c:(.text._read_r+0x24): undefined reference to `_read'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-exit.o): In function `exit':
    exit.c:(.text.exit+0x2c): undefined reference to `_exit'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-isattyr.o): In function `_isatty_r':
    isattyr.c:(.text._isatty_r+0x18): undefined reference to `_isatty'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
    sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0x14): undefined reference to `_sbrk'

gcc: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre><p>Oops! Turns out those <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> methods rely on the existence of some
underlying syscalls, but because this is bare-metal code, they’re nowhere to be
found!</p>
<p>But wait, what about
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17692428/what-is-ffreestanding-option-in-gcc"><code>-ffreestanding</code></a>?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t actually mitigate the problem much. Sure, the compiler
won’t use its built-in versions of common standard library routines, but it
won’t stop you from writing <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and trying to use them anyways!</p>
<p>Now, this certainly isn’t the end of the world. It’s entirely possible to
appease the linker by stubbing out
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib#newlib.2Flibc.2Fsys.2Fmyos.2Fsyscalls.c">these syscalls</a>
with some sort of panicking implementation, and working backwards from a crash
to determine which standard library method can’t be used. If you’re lucky, your
toolchain might even include some
<a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/tools-software/tools/f/arm-compilers-forum/44223/what-are-the-compile-option-differences-between---specs-nosys-specs-and---specs-rdimon-specs-in-arm-none-eabi-gcc">built-in</a>
syscall stubs.</p>
<p>In this particular case, it’s pretty obvious why the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> functions
wouldn’t work when writing bare-metal software. Unfortunately, things aren’t
always so simple.</p>
<p>For example, consider this (admittedly contrived) <code>greet</code> function that only
calls <code>malloc</code> if the input buffer is too small to fit the resulting
string:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;string.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;malloc.h&gt; // Uh oh!</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"myprintf.h" // hand-rolled printf that writes data over a serial port</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>char</span><span>*</span> name, size_t name_buf_len) {
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> greeting <span>=</span> <span>"Hello "</span>;
    <span>const</span> size_t greeting_len <span>=</span> strlen(greeting);
    <span>const</span> size_t name_len <span>=</span> strlen(name);

    <span>const</span> size_t final_size <span>=</span> name_len <span>+</span> greeting_len <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;

    <span>char</span><span>*</span> new_name;

    <span>if</span> (name_buf_len <span>&gt;</span> final_size) {
        new_name <span>=</span> name;
    } <span>else</span> {
        new_name <span>=</span> malloc(final_size); <span>// This won't work!!
</span><span></span>    }

    memmove(new_name <span>+</span> greeting_len, name, name_len);
    memcpy(new_name, greeting, greeting_len);
    new_name[final_size <span>-</span> <span>1</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span>;

    <span>return</span> new_name;
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {

</span><span></span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s entirely possible that the code will work 99% of the time, but occasionally
fail in the rare case when the buffer is too small, and <code>malloc</code> ends up getting
called. <code>malloc</code> typically relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbrk"><code>sbrk</code></a> syscall, which in this case, would
be stubbed out. Depending on how <code>sbrk</code> was stubbed out, The program might crash
with an <code>unimplemented syscall</code> error, or <code>malloc</code> might return a null pointer,
which this code (naively) doesn’t check for (after all, when was the last time
<code>malloc</code> failed on your work PC? /s).</p>
<p>One classic workaround for these sorts of footguns is to forgo the C standard
library entirely, and rewrite every method from scratch. After all, how hard can
it be to
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17591624/understanding-the-source-code-of-memcpy">implement <code>memcpy</code></a>
anyway? And sure, this approach might work fine for the simpler methods, but do
you <em>really</em> want to re-implement something like <code>sprintf</code> yourself? Probably
not.</p>
<p>Things get even hairier when using external C libraries. While many C libraries
proudly market themselves as “dependency-free”, they quite often implicitly mean
that they are <em>external</em> dependency-free, and still rely on the C standard
library internally. That’s not to say that there aren’t any <em>truly</em> dependency
free C libraries as well, there most certainly are. Unfortunately, for a
beginner systems programmer, the distinction between being “external” dependency
free and “truly” dependency free may not always be so obvious.</p>
<p>And so, it’s often the case the C programmers are left with one of two options:
use the standard library and be <em>very careful</em> not to use any methods with
hidden syscall dependencies, or forgo the standard library entirely and re-write
any bits of functionality they require themselves. Neither one of these options
is particularly “ergonomic”, and are far from beginner friendly.</p>
<p>If only the C standard library had a clear “line” between all the
platform-agnostic, dependency free bits of code, and all the platform-specific,
“requires an OS” bits of code…</p>

<p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get Rust up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal Rust “runtime” (cheekily called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/r0"><code>r0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Just like C, this extremely minimal approach to language design allows Rust to
run on just about any platform (well, assuming there’s
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compiler support</a>
for it).</p>
<p>Where Rust differs from C is with respect to its standard library. Learning from
the mistakes of C, the Rust language team made the excellent decision to split
the standard library into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html"><code>std</code></a>: The full-fledged Rust
standard library, “[offering] core types, like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>,
library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and
multithreading, among many other things.”</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><code>core</code></a>: The small <em>dependency-free</em>
foundation of Rust language. <code>core</code> “isn’t even aware of heap allocation,
nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require platform
integration, and [the <code>core</code>] library is platform-agnostic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemingly innocuous implementation detail turns out to be absolutely
<em>incredible</em> for bare-metal programmers, as it makes it possible to entirely
“opt-out” of all the OS-dependent bits of the standard library. By relying on
the <code>core</code> library directly, it’s possible to write truly portable bare-metal
code free of any and all “hidden” syscalls!</p>
<p>Unlike C, which allows separate item declarations and implementations (e.g:
declaring a method in a <code>.h</code> header file, and implementing it in a <code>.c</code> file),
Rust requires that items are implemented at the same time as they are declared,
making it <em>impossible</em> to get a linker error when writing typical Rust
code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>So, how does a “crate” (Rust lingo for library/binary) opt out of the <code>std</code>
standard library? Why, using the handy-dandy top-level <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute!</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute signals to the Rust compiler
that the crate shouldn’t link directly with <code>std</code>, and that it should instead
link with the <code>core</code> library directly.</p>
<p><del><code>#![no_std]</code> is also transitive down the dependency graph, so accidentally
including a dependency that relies on <code>std</code> within a <code>no_std</code> project will be
rejected by the compiler</del><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This transitive properly makes
it possible to use <code>cargo</code> (Rust’s built-in package manager) to integrate
external dependencies from <code>crate.io</code>, and be confident that if it compiles, it
won’t inadvertently panic at runtime due to a stubbed out “hidden” syscall
dependency. With Rust, using external dependencies with bare-metal code is not
only possible, but thanks to <code>cargo</code>’s best-in-class dependency management
story, it’s incredibly ergonomic as well!</p>
<p>To really show you the power of <code>no_std</code>, lets revisit the <code>greet</code> function from
the last section. Consider the following Rust implementation, which goes out of
it’s way to be as <code>unsafe</code> and un-idiomatic as possible. This could very well be
a “first pass” implementation from a C programmer just getting their feet wet
with Rust:</p>

<p>You’ve installed PostgreSQL. Now what? I assume you’ve been given a task that 
uses <code>psql</code> and you want to learn the absolute minimum to
get the job done.</p>

<p>This is both a brief tutorial and a 
quick reference for the absolute least you need to know about <code>psql</code>. 
I assume you’re familiar with the command line and have a rough idea about
what database administration tasks, but aren’t familiar with how to
use <code>psql</code> to do the basics.</p>

<p>View on <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/">GitHub Pages</a> or directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/postgres/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">PostgreSQL documentation</a> is incredibly 
well written and thorough, but frankly, I didn’t know where to start reading. This
is my answer to that problem.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints or suggestions please let me know by 
sending your feedback to tomcampbell@gmail.com.</p>

<p>It shows how to do the following at the <code>psql</code> prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#opening-a-connection-locally">Start and quit <code>psql</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="#h-help">Get help</a></li>
  <li><a href="#getting-information-about-databases">Get information about databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-database">Create databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-table-create-table">CREATE TABLEs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adding-a-record-insert-into">INSERT, or add records to a table</a></li>
  <li><a href="#select">SELECT, to do simple queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="#reference">Reference</a> pointing to the official PostgreSQL documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have access to a live PostgreSQL installation at the moment we still have your back.
You can follow through the examples and the output is shown as if you
did type everything out.</p>

<h2 id="the-psql-command-line-utility">The psql command line utility</h2>

<p>Many administrative tasks can or should be done on your local machine, 
even though if database lives on the cloud.
You can do some of them through a visual user interface, but that’s not covered here. 
Knowing how to perform these operations on the command line means you can script them,
and scripting means you can automate tests, check errors, and do data entry on the command line.</p>

<p>This section isn’t a full cheat sheet for <code>psql</code>.
It covers the most common operations and shows them roughly in sequence, 
as you’d use them in a typical work session.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Before using this section, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user name and password for your PostgreSQL database</li>
  <li>The IP address of your remote instance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="command-line-prompts-on-the-operating-system">Command-line prompts on the operating system</h3>

<p>The <code>$</code> starting a command line in the examples below represents your operating system prompt. 
Prompts are configurable so it may well not look like this. 
On Windows it might look like <code>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL&gt;</code> but Windows prompts are also configurable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ psql -U sampleuser -h localhost
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A line starting with <code>#</code> represents a comment. Same for everything to the right of a <code>#</code>. 
If you accidentally type it or copy and paste it in, don’t worry. Nothing will happen.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>This worked to connect to Postgres on DigitalOcean
<span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="using-psql">Using psql</h2>

<p>You’ll use <code>psql</code> (aka the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">PostgreSQL interactive terminal</a>) most of all because it’s used to create databases and tables, show information about tables, and even to enter information (records) into the database.</p>

<h3 id="quitting-pqsql">Quitting pqsql</h3>

<p>Before we learn anything else, here’s how to quit <code>psql</code> and return to the operating system prompt.
You type backslash, the letter <code>q</code>, and then you press the Enter or return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Press enter after typing \q
# Remember this is backslash, not forward slash
postgres=# \q
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes you back out to the operating system prompt.</p>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-locally">Opening a connection locally</h3>

<p>A common case during development is opening a connection to a local database (one on your own machine).
Run <code>psql</code> with <code>-U</code> (for user name) followed by the name of the database, <code>postgres</code> in this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># Log into Postgres as the user named postgres
$ psql -U postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-remotely">Opening a connection remotely</h3>

<p>To connect your remote PostgreSQL instance from your local machine, use <code>psql</code> at your operating system command line.
Here’s a typical connection.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> defaultdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’d enter the password. In case someone is peering over your shoulder, the characters are hidden. After you’ve entered your information properly you’ll get this message (truncated for clarity):</p>

<h3 id="looking-at-the-psql-prompt">Looking at the psql prompt</h3>
<p>A few things appear, then the <code>psql</code> prompt is displayed.
The name of the current database appears before the prompt.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>psql (11.1, server 11.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point you’re expected to type commands and parameters into the command line.</p>

<h3 id="psql-vs-sql-commands">psql vs SQL commands</h3>

<p><code>psql</code> has two different kinds of commands. Those starting with a backslash
are for <code>psql</code> itself, as illustrated by the use of <code>\q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>Those starting with valid SQL are of course interactive SQL used to
create and modify PostgreSQL databases.</p>

<h3 id="warning-sql-commands-end-with-a-semicolon">Warning: SQL commands end with a semicolon!</h3>

<p>One gotcha is that almost all SQL commands you enter into <code>psql</code> must end in a semicolon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example,suppose you want to remove a table named <code>sample_property_5</code>. You’d enter this command:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easy to forget. If you do forget the semicolon, you’ll see this perplexing prompt.
Note that a <code>[</code> has been inserted before the username portion of the prompt, and another
prompt appears below it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=#

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you do, just remember to finish it off with that semicolon:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=# ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="scrolling-through-the-command-history">Scrolling through the command history</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the up and down arrow keys to move backwards and forwards through the command history.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-information-about-databases">Getting information about databases</h2>

<p>These aren’t SQL commands so just press Enter after them. Remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When there’s more output than fits the screen, it pauses. Press space to continue</li>
  <li>If you want to halt the output, press <code>q</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-help">\h Help</h3>

<div><div><pre><code># Get help. Note it's a backslash, not a forward slash.
postgres=# \h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You’ll get a long list of commands, then output is paused:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Available help:
  ABORT                            CREATE USER
  ...
  ALTER AGGREGATE                  CREATE USER MAPPING
  ALTER PROCEDURE                  DROP INDEX
:
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Press space to continue, or <code>q</code> to stop the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get help on a particular item by listing it after the <code>\h</code> command.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to get help on <code>DROP TABLE</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \h drop table
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll get help on just tha item:</p>

<pre><code>Command:     DROP TABLE
Description: remove a table
Syntax:
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases">\l List databases</h3>

<p>What most people think of as a database (say, a list of customers) is actually a table. A database is a set of tables, information about those tables, information about users and their permissions, and much more. Some of these databases (and the tables within) are updated automatically by PostgreSQL as you use them.</p>

<p>To get a list of all databases:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 visitor   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 markets   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 tom       | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 

</code></pre>

<p>You can get info on a single database by following the <code>\l</code> prompt with its name.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to view information about the <code>template0</code> database:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l template0
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases-with-size-tablespace-and-description">\l+ List databases with size, tablespace, and description</h3>

<p>To get additional information on the space consumed by database tables
and comments describing those tables, use <code>\l+</code>:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l+
</code></pre>

<h3 id="x-expandnarrow-table-lists">\x Expand/narrow table lists</h3>

<p>Use <code>\x</code> (X for eXpanded listing) to control 
whether table listings use a wide or narrow format.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Effect</th>

<h2 id="remotely-happy">Remotely happy</h2>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to adopt a remote working model. Employees get to
choose where to live independently of where they work and save a lot of time and
money on sometimes long commutes (which is also great for the climate â€“ with all
the focus currently being on Covid 19 we must not forget about the real
existential crisis humanity is facing after all). Companies also benefit as they
can attract the best talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of who
they can hire by their location.</p>
<p>Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the required infrastructure and tools are available, it is still not
easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling to go remote and
yearn for the return of the days of the office. The reality is those days are
not going to come back in many industries though and making remote work a
success is going to be one of the key challenges many companies will be facing
in the coming years.</p>
<p>We have run simplabs as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days,
we faced many of the same challenges other teams are struggling with now. Over
time, we overcame each one, and learned a lot along the way. Today, we have team
members in six countries across Europe with people working from co-working
offices in Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin, or even from a
sailboat in Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages
of working remotely â€“ 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for
the rest of their careers and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely
as well according to
<a href="https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study by Buffer</a> that
was conducted in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="a-remote-culture">A remote culture</h2>
<p>Adopting a remote working model does not necessarily have to mean for everyone
to go remote immediately. It can of course be adopted completely and for
everyone but also partially or incrementally as an option only while still
keeping the office for everyone who likes to continue working from it. However,
it is an allâ€“orâ€“nothing kind of change in terms of working culture regardless of
how many team members will actually be working remotely. Remote work requires
fundamentally different practices when it comes to collaboration and management
and a lot of attention to aspects that are less relevant when the entire team
works from the same location.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. While diagrams, concepts, or calendars pinned to the
wall (or the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned into a status symbol for
teams that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable and probably good tools
for sharing information among people that all work from the same location, in a
remote environment, these practices don't work. All information shared in such
ways will be completely invisible for everyone who is not in the office,
excluding remote team members from participating in decision-making processes
and preventing them from effectively contributing to the common goal.</p>
<figure><img alt="Burn down your sticky notes walls" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@1000-79f1f215bf9f7d20d95247c1363bcd23.jpg 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@2000-224accf0036ced2f3423fcb4d8bc2ccc.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in any conversations
must be made transparent to the entire team. Writing summaries and protocols of
face-to-face conversations or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at
the desk next to the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in
the beginning. It is however a necessary prerequisite for making remote work
work at all and failing to do it properly will alienate remote teammates. In
that way, the pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the
same time might even have made the transition easier rather than harder for them
because everyone was in the same position and shared the same perspective.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-trust">Cultivating Trust</h3>
<p>Another very important cultural aspect to consider when a team goes fully or
partly remote is trust. Many managers' first reaction, when faced with their
teams working remotely, is asking</p>
<p><em>"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"</em></p>
<p>Just because managers cannot <strong>see</strong> the work happening does not mean it does
not happen. Managers' desire to micro-manage teams is an equally bad habit
regardless of whether the team is remote or not â€“ yet, remote teams seem to
increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently even more than with all of the team working from the
office. However, the occasional check-in for a status update is just as
interruptive remotely as it is in the office.</p>
<figure><img alt="Direct messages are interruptive and keep people from working" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@1000-3d75f68182ec16f78066993a31c4d5d6.png 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@2000-c665229d789cffd7a3165c4c44f77a26.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>The reality is that remote workers are likely more productive rather than less
as they will find it easier to focus and be less stressed according to the
<a href="https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Remote Work 2019 report by OWLLabs</a>.
Building up that trust and allowing people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is going to be a task for many managers
to learn over the next years.</p>

<p>Working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. There
are a plethora of great tools available and many companies are even using some
of them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there
are plenty of options available â€“ mostly those fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools for ad-hoc, real-time communication</li>
<li>tools for knowledge management and sharing</li>
<li>tools for organizing work and communicating status</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is important to have tools for all of these use cases, it is equally
important to keep the total number of tools in use to a minimum to prevent
chaos. There is always going to be the new hip tool that everyone wants to try
and doing so often silently makes that new tool part of the de-facto toolset a
team uses, growing that little by little over time. Eventually, teams then end
up with entire landscapes of tools, where nobody knows what kind of information
goes where and although each tool is perfectly good in isolation, in combination
they cause more confusion than they support the team.</p>

<p>Team chat tools like Slack (or Microsoft Teams for the more classic companies)
have seen widespread adoption over the past years and there are only a few
companies that don't use any of those at this point. They have developed into
the backbone for remote work for many teams. While in an office environment,
sending someone or a group of people a chat message saves you having to walk
over to a separate room or building, in a remote environment it is the <strong>only</strong>
way to reach out to someone directly (unless you call the person but who does
phone calls anymore?). What's easy to forget is how interruptive these tools can
be. Sending someone a chat message always implies urgency. Even if we all know
the majority of chat messages we get are in fact not urgent, it's hard to ignore
someone who just starts talking (writing) to you.</p>
<p>While most remote workers experience it is easier to focus, a liberal
communication style on team chat can demolish a lot of that increased focus
again. For effective communication, it is important to be respectful of other
people's time and need to focus on their work. Not everything is urgent all of
the time and justifies notifying a coworker or even a group of people. The fact
that you feel like you need something now doesn't necessarily mean someone else
should stop what they are currently doing to answer you. In many cases, sending
a good old email that is going to be less intrusive and more respectful of the
recipient's time is the better communication option compared to sending the
person a message on team chat asking for something that could totally wait until
tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to keep people in the loop and ensure
transparency of communication when using any kind of communication tool.
Communication that happens via direct messages between two people is invisible
to everyone else, while it might actually be relevant to others as well. As a
rule of thumb, we recommend keeping everything in public channels unless the
topic is strictly confidential or private in nature.</p>
<p>Although the information in public channels will be accessible to everyone, it
is important to understand any real-time communication tool is essentially
ephemeral in nature. While that is not technically correct and most tools do in
fact store all communication indefinitely, even with built-in search
functionality it is practically impossible to find a piece of information you
are looking for that was discussed for example in some Slack channel (you likely
don't even remember which one) the day before. So while team chat is a good
mechanism to communicate among the team in a low effort, informal way, any
information or decisions that are made via it need to eventually make their way
into other, more permanent, and organized systems.</p>
<h4 id="video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</h4>
<p>Besides text-based communication systems, of course, video conferences play a
major role in remote work as well. That way of communication has seen a huge
boost in adoption during the pandemic with everyone isolating at home and many
people using video calls for the first time even (I'm sure everyone had their
<em>"Dad, the camera is pointing on the floor"</em> moments). While late adopters
expectedly struggled with the technology, many remote teams experience similar
problems during their daily work lives. Poor audio or video quality, dogs
barking in the background, calls starting 10min late until everyone has figured
out their setup, etc. are common problems for many teams and have a severe
negative effect on meeting efficiency.</p>
<p>All these problems are easy to prevent when following a number of simple
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be proper audio and video hardware in place. For two or more
people joining a call together that means a proper conference speaker that
ensures people on the other end will be able to hear everyone in the room even
if more than one person …</li></ul></div></div>

November 16, 2020 | https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who doesn’t love a good stack teardown? Ever since I saw <a href="https://cushionapp.com/running-costs/">Cushion’s running costs</a> page, I’ve been low key addicted to reading about how other apps are built.</p>
<p>I work on an app called <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> that helps musicians and podcasters make videos for social media. So in the spirit of the teardown, here are the tools and services I use to run it!</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list — I’ve omitted some obvious ones (like HTML) and ones that are implied by other tooling choices (like HCL for Terraform).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> — A superset of JavaScript with static types. I fell in love with this language when I first tried it a few years ago, and it’s only gotten better since then. I use it for both the frontend and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> — A superset of CSS with cool features like mixins and nesting. I use it for both the marketing site and — with <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a> — the web app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-systems-and-frameworks">Build Systems and Frameworks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> — The frontend is a single-page app built with React, which has been a great choice — it gets out of the way and lets me just work on the app. There might be other frameworks out there that are quote unquote better, but the sheer size of the React community means I basically never run into any uncharted territory.</li>
<li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> — A batteries-included build system for React. The first time I made a React app, I cobbled together the configuration for Webpack/Babel/etc myself. Create React App hides all that — with the option to “eject” and get the full configuration if I ever need to do something it doesn’t support.</li>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> — A Node.js server-side framework. Just like with React, I chose it because it’s the most popular by far. As for why I chose Node.js rather than another language, it’s because I need to run the same video rendering code in the browser and on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> — A fast static site generator written, used to build the marketing site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>This list is also not exhaustive, but there are too many libraries to name them all here, so I’ve tried to keep it to the most notable or interesting ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction">immer</a> — An intuitive, performant way to do immutability. It can also serialize patches you make to an object, so it’s fairly easy to implement undo functionality as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.downshift-js.com/">downshift</a> — A React library for building accessible dropdowns and multi-selects. Easy to style, and you get accessibility for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper</a> — A nifty little tooltip positioning library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> — Node library for using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas API</a> on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> — Swiss army knife audio and video library. I use this to on the server convert audio files to WAV and to combine individual frames into users' videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> — Domain name registrar. Don’t get turned off by the slightly sketchy name — they’re my favorite registrar that I’ve used.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> — Provides DNS, SSL termination and DDOS protection for the websites and API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> — Hosts static files for the app frontend and marketing site. It’s really easy to use and there’s a generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> — Cloud infrastructure provider, but with plain Linux servers rather than proprietary services. I use them for servers, databases, and object storage to host users' file uploads and videos. Their web UI and API are both really easy to use; I never want to go back to AWS. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e506b6f94e20">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> — Transactional email provider. I switched from <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> when I exceeded their free tier and couldn’t get in touch with support, and boy am I glad I did. Postmark’s delivery rate is better, and the dashboard is faster and easier to use. If you’re a bootstrapped startup, they’ll give you a <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/for/bootstrapped-startups">$75 credit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> — Relational database for persisting the app’s data. I briefly considered <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well, but PostgreSQL has a bunch of really nice features like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html">returning data from modified rows</a>. I did not consider non-relational databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> — Key/value store, only used for a task queue. Usually I would put this part off and just build a monolith, but CPU-intensive video rendering needs its own server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> — Time-series database for storing metrics. See the section on <a href="#monitoring">monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> — The Linux distribution that the servers run. Like other parts of the stack, I chose it because it’s one of the most popular.</li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> — A web server and reverse proxy, used here as a load balancer for the API servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a> — A daemon that manages the processes&nbsp;on the server, like Node.js and nginx. <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">pm2</a> is another popular one, but it’s Node-specific.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>
<p>I’ve previously written about how I deploy SongRender, so you can <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/bluegreen-deploys-and-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/">read about it in more depth</a> if you’re interested. If you just want the high level, these are the tools involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> — An “infrastructure as code” tool, where you describe the infrastructure you want and it diffs with the infrastructure that actually exists. Kind of like React, but for configuration management. I love Terraform, and I use it to manage any infrastructure it supports.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> — A tool for building machine images. This makes it easy to deploy servers with Terraform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sentry.io/organizations/songrender/issues/">Sentry</a> — Error tracking. Picks up any uncaught exceptions in the client- and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">Statuscake</a> — Uptime monitoring, making sure the website and API don’t go down. Chosen for its generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.papertrail.com/">Papertrail</a> — Log management. It forwards system log messages using <code>rsyslog</code>, so I can just use <code>console.log</code> in my server-side code and have it picked up. At some point I might try to switch to a service that supports structured logs, like <a href="https://timber.io/">Timber</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">Telegraf</a> — Agent that collects metrics from the servers and forwards them to InfluxDB. It makes it very easy to get metrics on CPU/memory/etc without paying an arm and a leg for something like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> — Metrics dashboard that displays data from InfluxDB and PostgreSQL. It’s easy to set up and use, and its visualizations are pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indicative.com/">Indicative</a> — App analytics. I was using <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, but I ended up exceeding their free tier — which was a shame, because I liked them a lot more. Might check out <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> when I have time.</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> — Website visitor stats for the marketing page and app. It’s simpler than Google Analytics and only $15 per month for small sites. <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/WBX5G9">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search console</a> — Analytics about Google searches for which SongRender has shown up in the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> — Credit card processing and subscriptions. I <strong>love</strong> using Stripe. Their APIs are so well thought-out, the developer tooling is great and their documentation and dashboard are beautiful and easy to use. Their support is also responsive and helpful. I had such a positive experience with them that I registered SongRender LLC with Stripe Atlas, even though it cost a bit more than doing it manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> — Additional payment option. As happy as I am with Stripe, I’m that unhappy with PayPal: their tooling is lackluster, their documentation is not comprehensive and their website is slow. It’s also clearly not meant as a payment option for in-app purchases — for example, if you’re a new merchant, they’ll hold payments for a few weeks unless you upload a shipping label, which I obviously can’t do. People seem to like having it as a payment option, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> — My business bank. One of the three options Stripe recommended as part of Atlas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> — Vector graphics editor. I designed the SongRender logo using this, and I touch up icons with it too. I tend to go back and forth between this and <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, which I also really like — but there’s still an appeal to using a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/">native app</a> that doesn’t store all my data in the nebulous cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://nucleoapp.com/">Nucleo</a> — Library of SVG icons. I bought the lifetime package years ago and have used it in basically every project since. <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=427">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a> — Nifty web app that cleans up and compresses SVGs. It’s basically a frontend for <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://squoosh.app/">squoosh</a> — Nitfy web app that compresses PNGs and JPGs; the raster image counterpart to SVGOMG.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> — Not quite a text editor, not quite an IDE. Probably the best Electron app I’ve ever used. I keep checking out <a href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a> out of a love for all things Panic, but it’s not quite there yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://postgresapp.com/">Postgres.app</a> — Simple free local PostgreSQL server for macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate">dbmate</a> — Language- and database-agnostic migration tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> — Source code hosting and versioning.</li>
<li><a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> — Code formatter for JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you’ve never used a code formatter before, do it now. It’ll change your life.</li>
<li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> — Test runner for JavaScript. Bundled with Create React App.</li>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> — Alternative package manager for Node.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> — SongRender doesn’t need to be compiled, so this is just a task runner. <a href="https://www.thapaliya.com/en/writings/well-documented-makefiles/">Self-documenting Makefile snippets</a> are super helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> — Great indie Mac app for querying Postgres databases.</li>
<li><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> — HTTP client. I use this sometimes when I’m working on the API and don’t want to worry about the browser. I also use it as a very crude admin dashboard: the API has a few admin endpoints for things like retrying a failed render, which I hit directly from Insomnia. <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a non-Electron alternative that I’ll spend the $50 on at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> — File transfer app. I use this whenever I need to poke around object storage, since it’s much easier than using DigitalOcean’s web-based file browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crisp.chat/">Crisp</a> — In-app support chat. It’s the slickest, least obtrusive one I could find with a free tier. I’d like to switch to <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but can’t justify the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> — A kanban board for keeping track of bugs and features. A killer feature for me is the ability to add checklists to cards. Before I deploy a feature, I make an exhaustive checklist of cases to test. I’ve caught so many bugs this way; checklists should be a crucial tool in any developer’s QA arsenal. <a href="https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions">Checklists work</a>! <a href="https://trello.com/jakelazaroff/recommend">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> — A repository for less structured note-taking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> — The email provider I use <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/giving-up-google">instead of Gmail</a>. <a href="https://ref.fm/u20086848">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> — Raster&nbsp;image editor. I mostly use it as a lightweight Photoshop alternative when I need to tweak screenshots.</li>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> — Markdown …</li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Maybe it came via email, or a direct message on social media. But the message is always the same: “I’ve found a great opportunity to make money, and I can get you in, too.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now, in the social media age, most of us know that </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/10-million-women-pitched-by-mlms/"><span>being approached with a message like that</span></a><span> usually means that someone wants us to join their multi level marketing scheme, or MLM. But what many people </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> know is that the message could mean something more sinister: That you’re being recruited for an illegal pyramid scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Many people refer to MLMs as pyramid schemes, and there’s a lot of confusion online about the difference between the two. So how do you know if that friend or family member is approaching you with a legitimate business opportunity, an outright scam, or something that lives in the gray area in between those two options?</span></p>

It’s no wonder —&nbsp;they have a lot of traits in common.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Federal Trade Commission, a </span><b>pyramid scheme</b><span> is a scam that can look a lot like a legitimate business opportunity or an MLM, but the main difference is that pyramid schemes are set up to keep a constant flow of new recruits (and their money) coming into the business. Because of this, participants will often be heavily encouraged to recruit others (often their friends or family) to join.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a common misconception that if you’re asked to buy or sell a product, it’s not a pyramid scheme, but that isn’t true —&nbsp;pyramid scheme members are often asked to pay fees or consistently buy small amounts of product to keep their standing in the scheme, even if they still have a large amount of inventory they’ve been unable to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><b>multi level marketing scheme</b><span>, on the other hand, is not illegal. MLM companies sell products or services, and </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/the-mlm-epidemic-in-13-jaw-dropping-maps-2019-11-8/"><span>recruit salespeople</span></a><span> to market and sell them directly to their friends, families, and networks. MLM participants are usually referred to as “distributors,” “participants,” or “contractors,” and they are </span><b>not</b><span> employed by the MLM company —&nbsp;they work as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span>Participants in MLMs often also struggle to sell enough products to clear their inventory or reach sales goals that will earn them advertised rewards. But according to the FTC, what sets an MLM apart from a pyramid scheme is that, in an MLM, the company will pay its participants </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> for selling products, and while recruiting new members might help them earn more money, it’s not a requirement for membership.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll go into more detail below about how to recognize a pyramid scheme or MLM, what red flags to look out for, and how to protect yourself from scams and bad business opportunities.</span></p>

Luckily, the FTC provides a list on its website of possible warning signs.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters make extravagant promises about how much money you can earn</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Whether it’s a pyramid scheme or MLM, your earning potential can be limited by many factors outside of your control, and anyone promising you’ll earn a certain amount is not being truthful.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to join</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Often, they’ll play on your emotions (“You’d be a bad dad if you didn’t take advantage of this opportunity to support your family”) or create a false sense of urgency (“This deal will be off the table if you don’t join today”). These kinds of tactics are employed to get people to join without taking the time to research the company. A legitimate business opportunity won’t require you to make any hasty decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>If participants buy more products than they can use or sell, </b><span>it might be a pyramid scheme. Participants will be required to buy a certain amount to stay “active” in the organization, and so even if they already have an excess of inventory, they’ll be forced to buy more. If you see this happening, it’s a major red flag.</span></p>
<h3><span>What To Do If You Encounter a Pyramid Scheme</span></h3>
<p><span>If you ever encounter what you suspect to be a pyramid scheme (even if you aren’t 100 percent sure), you can report it to the FTC so they can investigate.</span></p>
<p><span>FTC reports can be made online at </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1"><span>ftccomplaintassistant.gov</span></a><span>. Click “Education, Jobs, and Making Money,” and then select the option to submit a report about “Multi Level Marketing or Pyramid Schemes.” You’ll be taken to a series of forms where you can include all the details you know, so the FTC can decide whether it needs to launch a formal investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that the FTC won’t help you resolve an individual dispute, so if you’re looking to get money back after being recruited into a pyramid scheme, this avenue might not help you. But you have options for that, which we’ll explore more below.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Recognize Multi Level Marketing (MLM)</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference that distinguishes multi level marketing (also called MLM or direct sales) is that members of an MLM won’t be strictly </span><i><span>required</span></i><span> to recruit new members in order to get paid. They should be paid for selling the company’s products or services, regardless of whether or not they recruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How MLM Participants Make Money</span></h3>
<p><span>Often, MLMs are set up so participants receive a commission from the products they sell themselves, and then, often a smaller commission from the products sold by participants they’ve recruited (called their downline).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this makes it possible to earn money only from the commissions from your own product sales, making a significant amount of money would require selling massive amounts of products, and most people just don’t have customer networks that can support that. And so, in some of these companies, the only way to make significant amounts of money is to recruit many, many people and collect commissions on their sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though MLMs aren’t illegal, the FTC </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0065-multi-level-marketing-businesses-and-pyramid-schemes"><span>warns on its website</span></a><span> that </span><b>most of the people who join them make very little money</b><span>, and some even lose money. MLMs are structured so that only a small number of people who join the organization early on can typically recruit enough participants to reach high levels of income and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/5bpek0/within_15_cycles_you_run_out_of_people_the_math/"><span>where a Reddit user did the math</span></a><span>: Because of the way MLMs are structured, there simply aren’t enough people on earth to support enough recruitment for people outside of the top 2 or 3 levels to reach the highest status, income, and rewards offered by MLM companies. As that Reddit user’s spreadsheet shows, if each member recruited only five new members, within 15 cycles, they’d surpass the entire population of the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you’re lucky enough to be one of the first few sellers/recruiters to join an MLM, you might amass enough of a downline to earn a good living. Any later than that, and it may be actually impossible for you to recruit enough to make a significant income.</span></p>
<h3><span>Are MLMs Illegal?</span></h3>
<p><span>According to the FTC, truly legitimate MLMs are not scams or pyramid schemes, and are not illegal.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the FTC has </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/ftc-alleges-neora-formerly-known-nerium-operates-illegal"><span>filed numerous lawsuits</span></a><span>, including several </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/10/ftc-settlement-ends-advocares-alleged-pyramid-scheme-bans"><span>in the last few years</span></a><span>, against MLM companies that it says crossed the line and operated as pyramid schemes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This highlights an important lesson for anyone considering joining an MLM: </span><b>Just because an MLM company has been operating for a long time or seems legitimate, doesn’t mean it’s not a pyramid scheme</b><span>. It’s important to carefully research these companies before joining them, and to temper any expectations you might have about quick success or extravagant earnings.</span></p>
<p><span>That isn’t to say that MLMs are bad for </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> people. Some early joiners do make a lot of money. And some people join just to buy products they love at a discount, or to sell small amounts of product for a side income. MLMs should be approached with caution, and before joining one, you have to be OK with the possibility that you could lose money, or make very little.</span></p>
<h2><span>Have You Fallen Victim to a Pyramid Scheme or a Scammy MLM?</span></h2>
<p><span>If you encounter a pyramid scheme, you should </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/reports"><span>report it to the FTC</span></a><span> right away. And if you encounter an MLM that’s using shady sales tactics or misleading its members, you should report that, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But what about you? If you’ve lost money, or you’re looking for justice after a bad experience with these kinds of schemes, what legal options do you have?</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A year or so ago when I started my yourney into embedded development (to build a PID controller for my coffee machine) I bought a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_RGB_OLED_Module">1.5 inch RGB OLED display</a>, which uses a SSD1351 controller. I got lucky, because a display driver for it <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ssd1351">already existed</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very recently it stopped working and I’m not sure why. Okay, maybe I tightened those screws a bit too much. Anyways, since I did not need a color display, I bought a very similar <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">1.5 inch OLED display</a>. After plugging it in and not seeing anything rendered on the screen (and not touching my screwdriver), I realized that it uses a different controller: the SSD1327. This time I wasn’t as lucky, because there happened to be no embedded rust driver out there yet.</p>
<p>When life gives you lemons, write a display driver for them - and then blog about it so everyone gets to learn maybe a thing or two.</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/display-clean.jpg" alt="Display with Text"></p>
<p>The basic driver we are going to implement in this post works, but is neither flexible nor configurable. The full driver (which is still evolving) is goint to be a bit more complex and can be found <a href="https://github.com/daschl/ssd1327">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, we first need to figure out how to talk to the display and what protocol to use. The <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/a/ac/SSD1327-datasheet.pdf">Datasheet</a> is very handy and I recommend to keep it open in a separate tab while working on the code.</p>
<p>The controller supports different modes of communication: 4-wire SPI, 3-wire SPI, I2C, Parallel 6800 and Parallel 8080. In this blog post we’ll use 4-wire SPI which is the one the display comes preconfigured with. The bytes we send over SPI can either be commands (for example to turn the display on or off) or actual pixel data to render on the screen. The datasheet thankfully has all that info, but it can be a little tough to digest at first if you need to start from zero.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don’t need to start from zero. There are two very useful codebases out there which will help us hit the ground running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the demo code from the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">Waveshare Website</a>, which contains C code we can look at, which is very helpful especially to understand what commands we need to send during startup.</li>
<li>A controller driver for the very similar <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306">ssd1306</a> exists, and it is very well written. We can borrow some concepts like the command structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could directly talk to our hardware SPI interface, but that is not going to be very portable. Ideally we want to plug this display driver into the established embedded rust ecosystem and benefit from code reuse and portability. For our purpose, three crates are important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/therealprof/display-interface">display-interface</a>: traits that bridge between a bus driver (i.e. SPI) and a display driver (our ssd1327). By using this crate, we also open the door to support I2C later.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics">embedded-graphics</a>: once we can talk to the device, we also need to render pixels. This crate will make it super easy to render text, lines and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal">embedded-hal</a>: this is the main hardware abstraction layer crate and we’ll use it to talk to specific hardware pins and use time delay functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to make use of all three in the next sections.</p>

<p>Before we can render pixels on the screen, we need to initialize our display. The datasheet contains <em>a lot</em> of different commands, many of them are hardware oriented and it is pretty hard to figure out what we need. Thankfully, if we peek into the waveshare sample code, we can see a function like this:</p>
<div><div>

  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>200</span>);

  <span>//Turn on the OLED display
</span><span></span>  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xAF</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This gives us a first idea: we need to reset the display, then initialize it, sleep and then write <code>0xAF</code>. Searching for <code>AF</code> in the datasheet tells us that this command will turn the display on. Alright, let’s start with reset:</p>

  OLED_RST_1;
  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>100</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The code sets the RST (“reset”) pin from our display to high, then low and then high again, sleeping 100ms in between. So how would we translate that to rust?</p>

</div><p>The <code>embedded-hal</code> crate defines two important traits: one for an <code>OutputPin</code> and one to <code>Delay</code> for a certain number of milliseconds. The actual implementation comes from your board HAL (hardware abstraction layer), one of which we’ll see later. Also note that error handling is omitted here to simplify the code for this blog post.</p>
<p>Next up, we need to initialize the display. The C code is not very well documented, but we can see that a sequence of commands is sent to the display:</p>

  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xfd</span>);
  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0x12</span>);

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For our rust code we want to turn those commands into an actual <code>enum</code> so it is easier to understand. We also need to implement the equivalent of <code>OLED_WriteReg</code>, which will send those commands to the display. This is where the <code>display-interface</code> crate comes in. The <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait it defines abstracts the actual low level communication for us and we just need to call the implementation of the trait.</p>
<p>The idea of the following code is shamelessly taken from the excellent <code>ssd1306</code> crate. Every command gets its own enum variant and we can <code>send</code> it to our display:</p>

    }

</div>
</div><p>For the actual driver we need more commands, but the approach is always the same. On <code>send</code> we match on the enum variant and turn it into a byte slice which is then sent over the connection through the <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait.</p>
<p><em>If you wonder why it specifies the length and data in such a weird way (as I did): if you try to return the array in the match arms rust will complain that the match arms have different array sizes. So the workaround by <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles">jamwaffles</a> is to always return a byte array with the same length, but then pass a slice of the correct size to the display. This makes the compiler happy and keeps the implementation short.</em></p>
<p>Before we can glue it all together, we need to figure out how we can send the pixel information to the display.</p>

<p>Our display has 128 rows and 128 colums with a potential of 16 colors each. 16 colors are represented by 4 bits, which is why the internal graphic display data RAM (GDDRAM) contains a buffer of <code>128 * 128 * 4 = 65536</code> bits. This allows to store all information for our 16384 pixels. Since rust does not have a <code>u4</code> datatype, we’ll use a single byte <code>u8</code> representation instead. This allows us to store the information of two pixels in one byte, so we need a buffer size of <code>65536 / 8 = 8192</code> bytes.</p>
<p>This is where <code>embedded-graphics</code> comes in. It defines a <code>DrawTarget</code> trait which we need to implement for our display. All we need to tell it is how to draw a pixel and what our display size is, and it will figure out the rest for us (i.e. drawing text or a shape):</p>

</div><p>The first thing to note is <code>Gray4</code> on the <code>DrawTarget</code>. Since this trait supports all kinds of displays, we need to tell it which pixel colors we support. <code>Gray4</code> indicates 4 bit grayscale, so exactly what we need. This is also highlights how we utilize rust’s type system to our benefit. We will only accept pixel colors that our device actually supports, any attempts to pass in i.e. a red color will fail at compile time.</p>
<p>In the <code>draw_pixel</code> method, we extract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the pixel as well as its color through the <code>luma()</code> method. We first need to calculate the actual absolute position in our buffer based on the coordinates and then set the color on the element. Since we store 2 colors per byte the code needs to perform some bitshifting and either set the high or low 4 bits of the byte. This code has been taken from the waveshare C code and ported over to rust.</p>

<p>In a data sensitive application debugging is the most critical and time consuming especially if requests traffic is tremendously high, when it comes to debugging every developer’s last resort is application logs and debugging in large logs file is not an easy task.</p>



<div><p>In this post I will brief you about how we can make rails logs searchable, Using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</a>&nbsp;for making debugging fast and easy via&nbsp;UI enabled log search. Wait…, Filebeat is not a separate entity it falls under an elastic stack only which is a lightweight log shipper which will not hoard your resources.</p><p>This post will cover following&nbsp;</p></div>



<ul id="block-98606f77-5ee5-4d34-b8d1-5a5a51fb1195"><li>Brief intro to Elastic Stack</li><li>Filebeat configuration and setup</li><li>Custom Index Template with rollover for application logs</li><li>Lograge setup to output logs into JSON format</li><li>Demo Rails application&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pramodshinde/efk-rails">refer this repository</a></li></ul>



<h2>Brief&nbsp;about Elastic Stack</h2>



<p>Elastic stack comprises of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html">Elasticsearch</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/logstash">Logstash</a>&nbsp;formerly known as the ELK Stack which is used to monitor, visualize, search and analyse the applications data in realtime and Filebeat is a lightweight data shipper belonging&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats family</a>&nbsp;which is mainly used to ship data from files.</p>



<h2>Filebeat setup and configuration</h2>



<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>



<p>Installation of filebeat is dead simple. You can follow simple steps described in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html">official documentation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Sample filebeat.yml</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<code>/usr/local/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml</code></p>



<pre>#---------- Filebeat inputs ----------
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  json:
    message_key: message
    keys_under_root: true
    overwrite_keys: true
  paths:
    - /Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log
#ElasticSearch template setting 
setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"
#---------- Kibana ----------
setup.kibana:
  host: "0.0.0.0:5601"
#---------- Elasticsearch output ----------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["0.0.0.0:9200"]
  index: "sync-log-dev"</pre>



<p>In above configuration file we have configured following options&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>inputs – Used for specifying input for filebeat, here we have configured input as rails log file&nbsp;<em><code>/Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log</code></em>&nbsp;with JSON option which will decode logs structured as JSON messages&nbsp;</li><li>output – Used to set the output for filebeat, here we will write to elasticsearch indexes.&nbsp;</li><li>setup.kibana – the Kibana endpoint which will load the kibana dashboard</li></ul>



<h2>Custom Index Template with rollover</h2>



<p>We off course can use the default&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/ilm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover</a>&nbsp;options but you cannot use the custom index template names, this is specially needed if you want the setup environment&nbsp;wise kibana dashboards on a single kibana and elasticsearch instances and this is what we needed in most of the Rails applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here we will use the custom template and index lifecycle management (ilm) for rotating our logs indexes as per different rails environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable a custom index template name and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover policy</a>&nbsp;you need to follow the following steps</p>



<ol><li>Setup a ilm enabled to false, add custom template name and pattern with following options</li></ol>



<pre>setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"</pre>



<p>Above config will tell filebeat to use&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-*</code>&nbsp;name and index pattern respectively, It’s a common practice to specify the index pattern rather than using index name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Create a life cycle policy using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _ilm/policy/sync-log
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_age": "3d",
            "max_size": "100mb"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "2d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>Above will create a index lifecycle policy which will rollover indexes if its size reaches to 100mb or index age is 3 days whichever turns first true.</p>



<p>3. Create template pattern using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _template/efk-rails-sync-dev
{
  "index_patterns": ["efk-rails-sync-dev-*"], 
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.lifecycle.name": "sync-log", 
    "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "sync-log-dev" 
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create a template&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;with index alias&nbsp;<code>sync-log-dev</code>&nbsp;and attach lifecycle policy&nbsp;<code>sync-log</code>that created in step 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. In last step we will create the first index managed by a policy that uses the rollover action and designate it as the write index</p>



<pre>PUT efk-rails-sync-dev-000001 
{
  "aliases": {
    "sync-log-dev":{
      "is_write_index": true
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create initial index&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-000001</code>&nbsp;which will be used by filebeat to write output of application.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Application logs in JSON format&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you create index life cycle policy, template and first rollover index which will capture logs from filebeat harvester. You need make your application logs to output in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>To output rails logs into JSON format, we are using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge" target="_blank">lograge</a>&nbsp;gem once you add it in Gemfile and bundle install it will be available to use in you application.&nbsp;</p><p>For demo purpose, We will be logging only single controller actions into JSON and search via Kibana.&nbsp;</p><p>Following lograge configuration will output logs in JSON for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>$config/initializers/lograge.rb</p>



<pre>Rails.application.configure do
  config.lograge.enabled = true
  config.lograge.keep_original_rails_log = true
  config.lograge.base_controller_class = 'ActionController::API'
  config.lograge.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new "#{Rails.root}/log/sync_#{Rails.env}.log"
  config.lograge.formatter = Lograge::Formatters::Json.new
  config.lograge.ignore_custom = lambda do |event|
    # return true here if you want to ignore based on the event
    return false if event.payload[:controller].include?("SyncController") &amp;&amp;
     ['index', 'create'].include?(event.payload[:action])
    return true
  end
  config.lograge.custom_payload do |controller|
    if controller.class.name.include?('SyncController')
      SyncLogger.new(controller).log_data
    end
  end
end</pre>



<p>SyncLogger service to add some meta data to logger file</p>



<p>$app/services/sync_logger.rb</p>



<pre>class SyncLogger
  def initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
  end
  def log_data
    request_type = @controller.request.method
    username = @controller.current_user.try(:username) || 'guest'
    r_data = request_type == 'GET' ? JSON.parse(@controller.response.body) : @controller.request.parameters
    log_data = {
      u_agent: @controller.request.user_agent,
      request_time: Time.now.to_s(:number),
      search_key: "#{request_type}_#{username}_#{Time.zone.now.to_s(:number)}",
      ip: @controller.request.ip,
      user_id: @controller.current_user.try(:id),
      username: username,
      data: r_data
    }
  end
end</pre>



<p>Above service will create JSON output for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action in following format&nbsp;</p>



<p>$log/sync_development.log</p>



<pre>{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":16.64,"view":1.18,"db":0.2,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210529","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153529","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



		<div>



			
<p>In Denmark it is possible to register domains with funny characters such as æ, ø and å. And we do. One prominent example is our national portal for booking Covid-19 tests at <a href="https://xn--coronaprver-ngb.dk/">https://coronaprøver.dk</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Wikipedia calls these beasts Internationalised domain names</a>, so they must indeed exist.</p>



<p>Recently I quit my job (have a new one now, luckily) and found myself making posts on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">social network known as LinkedIn</a> to improve my prospects.</p>



<p>One of these posts was about about a hobby project I made called <a href="https://wishlist.dk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wishlist.dk">wishlist.dk</a>, an ad free wish registry. The big player on the Danish wish registry market (what a market: it seems every novice web developer in Denmark has launched one of these) is <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/">https://<strong>ø</strong>nskeskyen.dk</a>.</p>



<p>What I wanted to let my network know was something like:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have launched wishlist.dk – a gratis, ad and surveilance free alternative to evil wish list giant ønskeskyen.dk”</p><cite>– Morten Helmstedt, job seeker</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alas, LinkedIn’s URL parser breaks in many ways when trying to express your career news and feelings through internationalised domain names.</p>



<h3>How do thee fail? Let me count the ways.</h3>



<p>When making a post on LinkedIn with an URL, LinkedIn will try to:</p>



<ul><li>Create a preview of the first URL in the post</li><li>Create a short link for all URLs in the post containing a path (e.g. https://lindkedin.com/<em>path</em>), not for top level domains and subdomains without a path. It will generally look like and point to something like <em>https://lnkd.in/eCTD8Q9</em></li></ul>



<p>Here are the bugs I noticed in action:</p>



<h4>Posting like a sane person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="545" height="352" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png 545w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"><figcaption>Trying to post an internationalised domain name like any sane person would. Post preview fails to load. The link in the post itself works as expected, though.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Posting like a LinkedIn person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="550" height="648" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png 550w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><figcaption>Whois’ing the “real” domain name and posting it like no true Dane would. Post preview succeeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Things go from bad to worse when trying to post an internationalised domain name with a path such as <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://ønskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a>.</p>



<p>If I just post that URL, I get a post like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png" alt="" width="540" height="142" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png 540w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>LinkedIn shortens the link to make it more readable and to be able to track our smallest actions on the world wide web.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What happens when I click the link is this:</p>



<h4>INVALID REDIRECT</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="319" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png 773w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-300x124.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>An error! (Invalid redirect)</figcaption></figure>



<p>My browser (Firefox) tries to GET the URL and is redirected to <em>linkedin.com/slink</em>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="374" height="235" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png 374w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><figcaption>A 301 redirect in action!</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="357" height="381" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png 357w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px"><figcaption>The submitted URL is stored, but the location should probably be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://%C3%B8nskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a> or maybe even <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies</a>. Who knows? It’s complicated. LinkedIn engineers should definitely look into this!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>How I tried to fix this mess</h2>



<p>Well, I contacted LinkedIn on Twitter (WHAT!), tried e-mailing their security e-mail (no reply, of course, but only e-mail I could find) and got in touch with a very understanding Member Support Consultant named Vegard who tried his/her best:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="797" height="508" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png 797w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-300x191.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"><figcaption>Pretty impressive response after describing the problem.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>If our URL parser doesn’t work, just change your URL</h4>



<p>But then the engineering team told me that I should just stop posting internationalised domain names to LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png" alt="" width="610" height="471" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png 808w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-300x232.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-768x593.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"><figcaption>True for Chrome, not for Firefox, not from a usability perspective</figcaption></figure>



<p>I tried to have Vegard tell the engineers at LinkedIn to read up on internationalised domain names, but no such luck: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="793" height="571" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png 793w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-300x216.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"><figcaption>The sorry end.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>THE END</h2>



<h2>An aside:</h2>



<p>As another hobby project, I created <a href="https://lnk.dk/">lnk.dk</a>, a very simple short link generator (like wish registries, it seems every aspiring web developer in Denmark has made one of these). Using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>‘s built in <code>URLField</code> I can validate, store and correctly redirect internationalised domain names with hardly any work at all on my part.</p>



<p><em>If only tools like that were available for the engineers at LinkedIn to use for their URL parsing and shortening…</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>tldr: it’s back now!</p>



<p>At 00:42 in the early morning of November 16 (my time, Central European Time), I received an email saying that “someone” logged into my twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a> from a new device. The email said it was done from Stockholm, Sweden and it was “Chrome on Windows”. (I live Stockholm)</p>



<p>I didn’t do it. I don’t normally use Windows and I typically don’t run Chrome. I didn’t react immediately on the email however, as I was debugging curl code at the moment it arrived. Just a few moments later I was forcibly logged out from my twitter sessions (using tweetdeck in my Firefox on Linux and on my phone).</p>



<p>Whoa! What was that? I tried to login again in the browser tab, but Twitter claimed my password was invalid. Huh? Did I perhaps have the wrong password? I selected “restore my password” and then learned that Twitter doesn’t even know about my email anymore (in spite of having emailed me on it just minutes ago).</p>



<p>At 00:50 I reported the issue to Twitter. At 00:51 I replied to their confirmation email and provided them with additional information, such as my phone number I have (had?) associated with my account.</p>



<p>I’ve since followed up with two additional emails to Twitter with further details about this but I have yet to hear something from them. I cannot access my account.</p>



<p><strong>November 17</strong>: (30 hours since it happened). The name of my account changed to Elon Musk (with a few funny unicode letters that only look similar to the Latin letters) and pushed for bitcoin scams.</p>



<p>Also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120918">mentioned on hacker news</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jvor6q/daniel_stenbergs_curl_twitter_account_compromised/">reddit</a>.</p>



<p>At 20:56 on November 17 I received the email with the notice the account had been restored back to my email address and ownership.</p>



<p>Left now are the very sad DM responses in my account from desperate and ruined people who cry out for help and mercy from the scammers after they’ve fallen for the scam and lost large sums of money.</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>A lot of people ask me how this was done. The simple answer is that I don’t know. At. All. Maybe I will later on but right now, it all went down as described above and it does not tell how the attacker managed to perform this. Maybe I messed up somewhere? I don’t know and I refuse to speculate without having more information.</p>



<p>I’m convinced I had 2fa enabled on the account, but I’m starting to doubt if perhaps I am mistaking myself?</p>



<h2>Why me?</h2>



<p>Probably because I have a “verified” account (with a blue check-mark) with almost 24.000 followers.</p>



<h2>Other accounts</h2>



<p>I have not found any attacks, take-overs or breaches in any other online accounts and I have no traces of anyone attacking my local computer or other accounts of mine with value. I don’t see any reason to be alarmed to suspect that source code or github project I’m involved with should be “in danger”.</p>

    <div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Last Friday, Apple released <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/">Big Sur,</a> the latest version of macOS. While everyone else was busy downloading GBs of data from Apple’s servers, I took a different, less beaten path. Meet my new best friend, Ubuntu:</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 600w, https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1000w, https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Those who follow this blog would recall that I have been <a href="https://preslav.me/2020/08/02/in-search-of-a-new-laptop/">looking for</a> an alternative to an Apple-dominated ecosystem for quite some time. While I tried different laptops, I never really got the same feeling of attachment that I have to my model 2015 MacBook Pro. It turns out, I like and respect older Apple hardware. There are tons of it out there, still in perfect working condition, waiting to be repurposed and made usable again. Yet, every newer generation of macOS would offer less and less of its capabilities. Sometimes, even intentionally hampering what one could tinker around within the name of “safety and integrity protection”.</p><p>In my view, 2015 was the last year any robust and sustainable laptops came out of there. You don’t have to agree with me.</p><p>So, I ran around looking for other options. An obvious choice would have been running Windows 10 on Bootcamp and trying to get my Linux experience with the WSL2. I am sure that it would have worked fine. But again, we are speaking about slightly older hardware here that we still want to use for writing software. Running Linux inside a VM, even as lightweight as the WSL2 was not an option, I’d be happy with. There was only one other option to get the Linux experience I wanted …</p><h2 id="running-linux-on-a-mac-does-that-even-work">Running Linux on a Mac? Does that even work?</h2><p>It does better than I and probably many of you would have expected. Both visually and under the hood, I am getting more out of the hardware than Catalina (ugh), or possibly, Big Sur would have managed to squeeze. If you use apps that have support or alternatives on other platforms and choose to go for a no-brainer distribution like Ubuntu, you won’t feel a difference in your end experience at all. Ubuntu’s default GUI is modern and snappy. Some even claim that Big Sur looks a lot more like Gnome or KDE than any previous version of macOS. Of course, Linux being open, if the default environment feels heavy for your hardware, one can always choose one from the myriads of other GUI options available on the Linux Universe.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-installation-process">What about the installation process?</h2><p>In my case, the installation was super smooth as well. I baked an Ubuntu image on a Micro SD card (works too, if you don’t have a USB stick) using <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a>. Before the installation, one has the option to try Ubuntu live by directly booting off the Micro SD (or USB stick). Simply,press Alt during boot, wait a few seconds and choose “EFI Boot” from the available options. I highly recommend to anyone to spend as much time as possible playing around before installing. I had written down a huge checklist of things I wanted to make sure I check before I even go and prepare my SSD for the installation. Make sure you have tested your WiFi, sound, Bluetooth, etc. I was lucky enough that my WiFi worked out of the box, but this might not be the case with other Macs. A working Internet connection is very important during the installation, so if your WiFi doesn’t happen to work, make sure you grab an Ethernet cable (and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if necessary) before you move on.</p><p>I will be brief about the rest of the process since everything is explained in detail in the guide I followed:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">How to install Linux on a Macintosh and dual boot with macOS</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><br>If you only have 256 GB SSD or less and want to keep your existing macOS available, be prepared for a lot of space freeing and partitioning your drive. I freed up 100 GB for Ubuntu and left some 4 GB for a swap partition. I intend to be able to reduce my macOS partition even further, eventually increasing the size of my Linux storage.</p><p>Once partitions were in place, installation and booting from Linux were no problem at all. In case they happen to be, the guide above explains how to set up a more advanced boot loader.</p><h2 id="what-i-am-still-struggling-with">What I am still struggling with</h2><p>Surprisingly little. Bigger things are the sound coming out of the audio jack (though speakers work perfectly), and maintaining proper scaling across my laptop’s screen and my external monitor. The latter one is more of a general issue on pretty much all OSes. I was positively surprised that Ubuntu picked up the native resolutions of both displays, so my picture was crystal sharp, albeit very small,and required adjusting some scaling. More minor issues include not being able to scroll with my Magic Mouse, and of course, having to learn to use Ctrl instead of Cmd for pretty much all things. I am sure though that given time, I will find appropriate solutions for all those things. None of them bothers me nearly enough to make me switch back.</p><p>I will try to report more on my experience after some time has passed. For now, I am more than happy.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="8.3.0"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>For many importers, the end of profitable manufacturing in China may be near. Apart from a tenuous and vague “phase one” trade deal, any kind of truce in the ongoing China-U.S. trade war seems distant. And without a resolution in the next few weeks, nearly all goods traded between the U.S. and China will have tariffs by December 15.</span></p><p id="viewer-adua0"><span>Is it any wonder why many manufacturers are now considering leaving China, while others are accelerating earlier plans to exit.</span></p><p id="viewer-drn2j"><span>Manufacturing in India stands out as a cost-effective alternative to China. Companies like Hasbro have announced plans to limit their number of China-made products to half, choosing to relocate much of their production to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-3clqd"><span>And Taiwanese Foxconn, which manufacturers Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo, built their first plant in India in 2015 and plans to expand operations there.</span></p><p id="viewer-5a9o5"><span>But many other companies are either looking for solutions outside India or prefer to remain in China. They view India’s many challenges—a skills gap and inadequate infrastructure among them—as insurmountable barriers to their continued success.</span></p><p id="viewer-1kpog"><span>Let’s explore how manufacturing compares between India and China and whether India may be the right sourcing choice for you.</span></p><div id="viewer-4c75k"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.aliaworld.com/post/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_b886c6ba02cb42f6ba3909c99634d44b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_400%2Ch_256%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_b886c6ba02cb42f6ba3909c99634d44b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="viewer-68ao9"><span>WHAT DOES INDIA EXPORT TODAY?</span></h2><p id="viewer-9cbef"><span>India exported more than $323 billion worth of goods in 2018. Meanwhile, China exported goods valued at nearly eight times as much. China’s top exports included products such as electrical machinery, appliances and equipment. While raw materials and products requiring less sophisticated manufacturing composed the majority of India’s exports.</span></p><p id="viewer-f2041"><span><strong>Mineral products, chemical products and precious metals and stones</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9sv1v"><span>India’s top exports are dominated by mineral products (16 percent), chemical products (14 percent) and precious metals (12 percent). Mineral products include mineral fuels and oils, such as Manufacturing in India vs. Chinapetroleum.</span></p><p id="viewer-4t78m"><span>Chemical products include various organic and inorganic chemicals, soaps, tanning dyes, fertilizers, explosives and, most notably, pharmaceuticals. India’s pharmaceutical industry now reportedly supplies:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-947qg"><p>50 percent of the world’s demand for various vaccines</p></li><li id="viewer-2k7f4"><p>40 percent of U.S. demand for generic drugs; and</p></li><li id="viewer-ef5ro"><p>25 percent of all medicine in the UK</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-baho4"><span>Contributing seven percent of the country’s GDP, India’s precious metals and stones industry employs 4.6 million workers. Labor-intensive cutting, polishing and processing of small diamonds is a particularly strong sub-sector for India. Other gems, gold and jewelry are other major products in this category.</span></p><div id="viewer-inev"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.aliaworld.com/post/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_9c904a6c67764948a1492d4f556b20e0~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_327%2Ch_324%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_9c904a6c67764948a1492d4f556b20e0~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-2i14b"><span><strong>Food and beverage</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-dror4"><span>Food and beverage products represent about 11 percent of India’s total exports, or $35 billion. Some of India’s leading exports in food and beverage include:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-citq4"><p>Basmati rice</p></li><li id="viewer-8o9ls"><p>Carabeef or meat of bovine animals</p></li><li id="viewer-f7e4l"><p>Frozen shrimp and prawns; and</p></li><li id="viewer-bqua5"><p>Refined sugar</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-3737a"><span>India’s broader agricultural sector accounts for 17 percent of the country’s economy and employs more than 60 percent of the population.</span></p><p id="viewer-7ql2u"><span><strong>Garments and textiles</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-bcu8t"><span>The garment and textiles industry is one of India’s fastest growing. Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector. Though the manufacturing sector now contributes only 16 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the “Make in India” initiative aims to boost that contribution to 25 percent by 2022.</span></p><p id="viewer-caorn"><span>And companies like Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus are investing heavily in R&amp;D in India. “Our success in India has proven to be a great model for our growth in other regions,” says OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. “…We are now closer to making India as our second headquarters.”</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6tjmf"><span>COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED LABOR IN INDIA AND CHINA</span></h2><p id="viewer-fp3rq"><span>Differences in manufacturing wages, size and skill level of the labor force should be at the forefront of your decision to move production from China to India. Depending on your product type, some of these factors may highlight clear advantages for remaining in China.</span></p><p id="viewer-6tdee"><span><strong>Manufacturing wages</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7q1sj"><span>Labor represents one of the main costs of manufacturing goods. And importers have watched China’s labor costs soar in recent decades, often growing by 10-15 percent annually. China’s minimum wages, which now range from about US$140 to US$346 per month, are set at the provincial level.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u605"><span>India’s minimum wages similarly vary across states and range from about US$66 to US$202. Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative. And importers of labor-intensive products, like garments and textiles, are in the best position to realize cost savings by moving to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-2dtbl"><span><strong>Labor force size and skill level</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-5d337"><span>Among the many manufacturing locations opposing China, India is unmatched in the size of its labor force. According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong. But Indonesia’s labor force, with 134 million workers, is a distant third for the region.</span></p><p id="viewer-fh5j3"><span>India falls behind many of its neighbors with regard to factors the World Economic Forum use to rank countries in their human capital report. India ranks 103rd overall, while China ranks 34th.</span></p><p id="viewer-3umpt"><span>One area where India suffers a deficiency is in “know-how”, which includes the breadth and depth of specialized skills at work. We see this directly at play in the quality and complexity of the country’s top export products. This metric also measures employers’ perceived ease at filling job vacancies.</span></p><p id="viewer-8obvp"><span>India also has room to grow with regard to its labor development rank. This rank considers access to and enrollment in formal education, opportunities to upskill and how well the education system fits the needs of a competitive economy.</span></p><p id="viewer-6aqg0"><span>Some have attributed the low development rank to India’s shortage of vocational schools.</span></p><p id="viewer-crl8q"><span>The relatively low labor participation rate in India—just 67 percent among the 25-54 age group as of 2017—also hurt the country’s human capital rank. India’s employment gender gap, one of the world’s largest, was another major contributor. In contrast, China achieved a labor participation rate of 88 percent for the same age group.</span></p><p id="viewer-3r1pr"><span>On the positive side, India has performed relatively well in terms of quality of education, staff training and economic complexity.</span></p><p id="viewer-aa1e7"><span>Read further at <a href="https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-1hgbn"><span><em><strong>If you are looking forward to source high-quality metal jewelry then reach out to us at </strong></em><a href="mailto:info@aliajewelery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong><u>info@aliajewelery.com</u></strong></em></a><em><strong> &amp; we'll provide you with a free quote as per your requirement.</strong></em></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>
