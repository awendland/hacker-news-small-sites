        <p>
          April 21, 2020

            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/life">life</a>
            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/roka">roka</a>
        </p>

        
<p>I’m an occasional on-call operator for my battalion, assisting the on-call commander and staffing the control room from 16:00 in the afternoon until 08:30 the next morning on weekdays. Most of the work is answering and making calls, updating documents, and making sure that nothing is out of the ordinary. It’s not that difficult, just tiring as there is a lot of stuff to follow and pay attention to through the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on-call on Friday, the 10th, and for 24 hours last Wednesday (not the usual shift), starting from 08:30 to the next 08:30 since it was the legislative election day in Korea. I wrote most of this post over those two shifts to share how I personally am being on-call.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little past 2300 is when I try to find some peace. I usually make myself a cup of coffee, and it doesn’t take long to feel the caffeine flowing through my bloodstream. I’m exhausted. It’s been many hours since I started my shift, and I have nine hours to go. No shift goes without a hectic evening with lots of random situations to handle, and they are usually followed by a series of paperwork.</p>
<p>I sit in front of a bunch of monitors and tactical comms equipment in bad posture, and the chair predates the concept of ergonomics. Meanwhile my feet are trapped in my airtight combat boots and they are begging to take a breath. In addition, no matter how much water I drink, my mouth is dry the whole time. It’s probably from all the sugar-intakes from snacking. It’s a similar feeling to a tiring second day at a college hackathon - constant snack intakes and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Around midnight, after I’m finished with all the paperwork that needs to be done by the morning, is a good time to seek solace in a cup ramen. It’s hard to convey the exact late-night-cup-ramen sentiment, but the hot soup warms you up in a way no others can console you in this late time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have books with me so that I can read whenever I can. Late in the night especially after a ramen session is usually a good time to read. Every time I try to read in the evening or during the day, I either get a disruptive phone call or a situation, and they make me re-read the same page multiple times. It gets annoying after a couple of tries.</p>
<p>When I tried to read on the past few shifts, I faced some sad ironies. I brought <em>Why We Sleep</em> to my first shift. Reading about the importance of sleep while not being able to sleep was quite saddening, so I stopped after a few pages in. At least I learned why I feel wide awake towards the end of my shift (in the morning), and why I have difficulties sleeping after my shift despite being tired as hell. Now I’m reading <em>the Utopia of Rules</em>, a book filled with social commentaries on bureaucracy and filling out paper forms. Reading that in between the processing and filling out a ton of paperwork was yet another sad irony I encountered. Inevitably and unfortunately, as the night passes, my ability to focus gets decimated. I wish I could accomplish more reading on the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 0300~0400, a little after 12 hours (or 20) into the shift, I’m usually passed out on my desk. In a zombie-like state, I get half-woken up by periodic phone calls but I occasionally sleep through the ringings. Sometimes I answer the phone and pretend to handle whatever they tell me, and then go right back to sleep, forgetting everything I heard. I also get woken up when I have to unlock a small safe with ammunition for those going to a guard shift at night. Even then, my body isn’t fully awake sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By dawn, I can feel my internal organs are rotting. With that, my body starts to produce an uncomfortable amount of gas. A little past 0600, with my internal rhythm resetting, my body spontaneously wakes me up. It’s when I start to get busy again. Meanwhile my body goes through this illusion of feeling refreshed, but soon enough it feels like it has aged about six months over the past six hours. It’s obviously not a great feeling and it takes me about two full days to recover. Five more on-call shifts will age me by two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite such horribleness, the one positive aspect about doing the on-call shifts is that I get to sleep in and rest for the entirety of the next day, getting exempt from pretty much everything. Then, after one shift, two days have gone by just like that. Time flies and a week passes by only after a few days. And I get to rest over the weekend. That’s a good feeling to have in here, the sense of getting closer to the discharge date quicker than how I would feel it otherwise. Just gotta rinse and repeat till I’m out. It’s like Stockholm syndrome - despite how shitty I feel during and after the shift, I’m a bit disappointed that I don’t have a shift this week.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

				
				
	<p>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>As you can see by the “ISO” part in the format’s name, it’s an actual
standard written by the International Organization for
Standardization. It defines many cool things like a way to write time
intervals, which can be useful for writing portable software, and a
calendar where the year is separated not by months but by weeks, which
is used in finances, but here we’re only interested in the basics.
Simplified, the core date format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
</code></pre><p>Yup, that’s about it. You write the year, the month, the day, and then
the time exactly like it’s done in other date formats. There’s nothing
extraordinary, so you can learn it in 2 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-better">Why it’s better</h2>
<h3 id="its-unambigous">It’s unambigous</h3>
<p>This is the main reason the standard was written and why people still
use it. Other date formats can be diffucult to tell apart. For
example, consider this date:</p>
<pre><code>02-03-04
</code></pre><p>When you read it out of context, you have absolutely no idea what’s
going on there. Is <code>02</code> here the day or the month? You just can’t know
unless the day in the date is greater than 12, in which case it just
can’t be a month:</p>
<pre><code>30-03-04
</code></pre><p>This day-month ambiguity is a really common problem, which often
occurs online. People just write down their dates in whatever date
format they know without even thinking that other people can interpret
it in different ways.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 doesn’t have this problem as it’s always obvious which part
is the day and which is the month because of the uniqueness of the
format:</p>
<pre><code>2004-03-02
</code></pre><h3 id="its-more-strict">It’s more strict</h3>
<p>While other date formats usually don’t provide strict requirements on
how to write something, ISO 8601 is an exception. Here there’s only
one correct way to write a date, which is not only useful for
computers to parse, but also helpful for humans to avoid confusion
with other formats and improve readability. Here are some of the
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elements in the date are always separated by a hyphen. Not many
date formats use this delimiter, and this also can be useful when
using dates inside filenames as slashes are usually not accepted in
them.</li>
<li>The elements are always padded to the maximum number of digits. This
not only makes all of the dates look equally nice, but also, coupled
with other quirks of this format, allows the files with the date in
the name to be sorted just by the filename.</li>
<li>The year is always written in the full form. This makes the format
unique when written down and  eliminates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">the year 2000 problem</a> in
any forms that it can take. For example, when writing down
birthdays, it always makes it obvious which century we’re talking
about.</li>
<li>The time is always written in the 24 hour format, so there can be no
confusion about what half of the day something happened in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="it-makes-more-sense">It makes more sense</h3>
<p>On the first glance, it seems like the European format is about as
logical as it can get - days go into months and months go into years:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>However, this ignores a very important characteristic of numbers -
endianness. Consider a regular number, for example:</p>
<pre><code>69420
&lt;---- Digits
</code></pre><p>As you can see the digits here do the opposite of what elements do in
the European format. When the leftmost element of something is the
most valuable, we call it big endian.</p>
<p>Thus, the European format is little endian while the numbers in it are
big endian:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>And the American format just makes no sense:</p>
<pre><code>12/18/2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
?????????? Elements
</code></pre><p>And, as you can see, ISO 8601 is completely consistent in this regard
as everything is big endian:</p>
<pre><code>2002-12-18
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- Elements
</code></pre><p>The situation becomes even worse if you consider time because it is
big endian, like ISO 8601, thus doesn’t work with any other date
format:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
---------&gt; &lt;------- Elements

12/18/2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
?????????? &lt;------- Elements

2002-12-18 23:03:59
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- &lt;------- Elements
</code></pre><p>If you’re still having trouble visualizing all of this in your head,
look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/ln33j2/datetime_format_by_region_visualised_v3_thanks/">this Reddit post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-standardized-and-actively-used">It’s standardized and actively used</h3>
<p>If you think that ISO 8601 is a silly thing that someone in their
basement made up and no one actually uses, think again because that
can’t be further from the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that it’s standardized says at least something. Does your
favorite format has a neat several hundred page document where it’s
described in extreme detail and that is internationally recognized?
Also the standard is quite far from being dead - after being
published in 1988 it was updated in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019.</li>
<li>As I already mentioned, the standard is actively used in IT.
Almost everything that is used by software and somehow involves a
written numerical date format already speaks ISO 8601.</li>
<li>yyyy-mm-dd has been adapted or used since the beginning as a
national date format by many countries such as Canada, Sweden, and
Japan. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country">this article</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="why-not-use-a-format-like-01-jan-2020">Why not use a format like 01-Jan-2020?</h3>
<p>It doesn’t have any of the nice features ISO 8601 has and doesn’t work
well internationally (i.e. assumes the person you’re communicating
with knows knows English). If you think the latter is not a problem,
imagine how you would feel feel if you had to read a date someone
wrote in their native language that you don’t understand:</p>
<pre><code>01-Янв-2020
</code></pre><h3 id="yyyy-mm-dd-looks-weird">yyyy-mm-dd looks weird</h3>
<p>The only reason why it does to you is because you’re not used to it.
After a little bit of practice, it’ll be even less weird than your
favorite date format.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-the-european-date-format-is-better-because-the-elements-are-in-the--order-of-relevance">Maybe the European date format is better because the elements are in the  order of relevance?</h3>
<p>First of all, the claim that the order of relevance is little endian
is quite questionable. The only situation when you can say that for
certain is when we’re talking about events occuring on a day-to-day
basis, however I can think of numerous cases when the year and the
month are more relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article publication date</li>
<li>Historical event</li>
<li>Personal event that happened a long time ago</li>
<li>Someone’s birthday</li>
<li>Random database entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the order of relevance is actually irrelevant. Even if the
order of relevance was this way, you’re not reading the dates out
loud, so there’s no need for them to be ordered a certain way. If
you’re not interested in the year, you just skip it and read the end
of the date just like you would do when reading time while not being
interested in the hour.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my opinion, ISO 8601 seems clearly superior to other date formats
when it comes to international communication (such as posting things
online), and as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so. While
the format certainly has an audience, it’s unfortunate that it’s not
as big as it could be. By writing this article, I hope I made you at
least think about different date formats and be more careful when it
comes to making people understand what date you’re talking about.</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

<h2>

  <small>single-file distributable web server</small>
</h2>

<p>
  redbean makes it possible to share web applications that run offline
  as a
  single-file <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/ape.html">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> zip archive which contains your assets. All
  you need to do is download the <code>redbean.com</code> program below,
  change the filename to .zip, add your content in a zip tool like
  Windows 10 or InfoZIP, and change the extension back to .com.

</p><p>
  redbean can serve 1 million+ gzip encoded responses per second on a
  cheap personal computer. That performance is thanks to zip and gzip
  using the same compression format, which enables kernelspace copies.
  Another reason redbean goes fast is that it's a tiny static binary,
  which makes fork memory paging nearly free.

</p><p>
  redbean is also easy to modify to suit your own needs. The program
  itself is written as a single .c file.

</p><p>
  Assets can be listed by running the following command:

</p><pre>unzip -vl redbean.com        # lists files
</pre>

<p>
  Assets can be added to the zip archive as follows:

</p><pre>zip redbean.com index.html   # adds file
</pre>

<p>
  By default, anything you add to the archive gets compressed. Sometimes
  you don't want that to happen. A good example is video files. The web
  browser will want to send HTTP range requests to seek in the video, in
  which case redbean requires that the asset be uncompressed.

</p><pre>zip -0 redbean.com video.mp4  # adds file without compression
</pre>

<p>
  Each connection uses a point in time snapshot of your ZIP file.
  If your ZIP is deleted then serving continues. If it's replaced
  then issuing SIGUSR1 (or SIGHUP if daemon) will reindex the zip
  for subsequent connections without interrupting active ones. If
  SIGINT or SIGTERM is issued then a graceful shutdown is started
  but if it's issued a second time, active connections are reset.

Thank you, <a href="https://kevzettler.com/">Kev Zettler</a>, for showing your work on the Dasung Paperlike Pro and making all of this possible. I will later create an accompanying video to go over the Dasung HD-FT teardown process.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="overview-of-the-dasung-hd-ft">Overview of the Dasung HD-FT</h2><p>The Dasung HD-FT is a third-generation e-ink monitor with a display of 13.3“, a screen resolution of 2200x1650, a touchscreen, and an adjustable backlight. The monitor connects via a proprietary Y cable, with connections for USB and HDMI; additionally, the Dasung HD-FT can be powered by the micro-usb connection on the left side.</p><p>Once connected to a computer, it acts as a second monitor or, for our purposes, a primary monitor for our e-ink laptop. The monitor’s physical buttons allow you to adjust the contrast, brightness, clear the screen, and change modes.</p><p>The modes (M1, M2, M3, Fast, Fast++, Black, Black+, Black++) correspond to how the monitor displays what’s rendered in the screen using different shades of grey or black/white.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look and dismantle the Dasung HD-FT and look at its components.</p><h2 id="opening-the-dasung-paperlike-hd-ft">Opening the Dasung Paperlike HD-FT</h2><p>Similar to Zettler’s observations and approach, the Dasung HD-FT is made of one piece of construction.

	<p>
In an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric</a>
display, it can be tricky to draw boxes of various sizes in the correct order
to keep them appropriately in front of or behind one another.  The figure below
shows an example.  The blue box should be drawn first, then green, then red.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure1a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure1b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 1: The boxes on the left are <u>not</u> drawn in the correct order, whereas the
boxes on the right are drawn correctly.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We will explore a simple solution for determining the correct order to draw a
given set of boxes.  But first, we must define what we mean by <em>boxes</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we mean by <em>boxes</em>?</h3>

	<p>
We define boxes as <em>axis-aligned</em> and <em>non-intersecting</em>
rectangular prisms. Take a look at the above Figure 1 again.  Each box is
parallel to the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axis (i.e.
axis-aligned).  Also, note that the boxes are next to each other but do not
intersect.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine if boxes overlap on screen.</h3>

	<p>
First of all, if two boxes do not overlap on the screen, then we do not have to
worry about which one is drawn first.  This is the first test we must perform,
which we explore in this section.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure2a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure2b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 2: No overlap on the left; overlap on the right.  (Note: we are talking
about overlap on screen, not intersection in space.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The silhouettes of the 3D boxes become 2D hexagons in the isometric view, as seen below.  We use the
outline of these silhouettes to test for overlap.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure3a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure3b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 3: The box silhouettes in an isometric view are simple hexagons.  Note
that their sides are always parallel to the vertical and two diagonal axes.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We take advantage of the fact that the hexagon sides are always parallel to
some axis.  This allows us to easily determine if the hexagons overlap by
checking for intersection of their regions on each axis.  We add an <em>h</em>
(horizontal) axis to help.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure4a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure4b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
The red and blue boxes do not overlap on the h axis, therefore they do not overlap.
The green and blue boxes do overlap since their region on every axis overlap.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
Now that we have outlined our concept for <em>determining if two boxes overlap
on the screen</em>, we will fill in the details necessary for implementing it.
	</p>

	<p>
The act of flattening the 3D box into a 2D hexagon involves getting rid of the
Z coordinate.  Notice that increasing a point's Z coordinate by 1 is the same
as incrementing both X and Y coordinates by 1.  Thus, we can add Z to both X
and Y and drop Z completely.  Shown below is the source code for a function
that performs this conversion.
	</p>

<code>
<span>function</span> spaceToIso(spacePos) <span>{</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isoX = spacePos.x + spacePos.z;
    <span>var</span> isoY = spacePos.y + spacePos.z;

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        x: isoX,
        y: isoY,

        
        h: (isoX - isoY) * Math.cos(Math.PI/6),

        
        v: (isoX + isoY) / 2;
    <span>}</span>;
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
And finally, after determining the bounds of each hexagon, we can determine if
they overlap by using the source code below.
	</p>

<code><span>function</span> doHexagonsOverlap(hex1, hex2) <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> (

        
        !(hex1.xmin &gt;= hex2.xmax || hex2.xmin &gt;= hex1.xmax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.ymin &gt;= hex2.ymax || hex2.ymin &gt;= hex1.ymax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.hmin &gt;= hex2.hmax || hex2.hmin &gt;= hex1.hmax));
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
Now that we have determined if two boxes overlap on the screen, we can begin exploring how to determine which box is in front of the other.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine which box is in front.</h3>

	<p>
Recall that our boxes do not intersect each other. we can visualize their separation
as a thin plane between them (see Figure 5 below).  After identifying this
plane, we can determine which box is in front by selecting the one on the
correct side of this plane.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure5a" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5b" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5c" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 5: A pair of blocks can be separated in one of three ways shown here.
The dark glass illustrates this separation.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We can find this plane of separation by looking at each axis individually.  In
particular, we look for an axis which has non-intersecting box ranges (see
Figure 6 below).
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure6a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure6b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 6: On the left, the blocks are separated on the y-axis.  On the right,
the blocks are separated on the x-axis. (The z-axis is omitted for simplicity.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
In Figure 6 above, we have chosen a coordinate system which make lesser values
of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to be closer to the camera.  Though not shown, the
<em>z</em> axis is positive in the up direction, so a greater value makes it
closer to the camera.
	</p>

	<p>
The following is a javascript function for determining if the first block is in
front of the second:
	</p>

	<code><span>function</span> isBoxInFront(box1, box2) <span>{</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.xmin &gt;= box2.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.xmin &gt;= box1.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.ymin &gt;= box2.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.ymin &gt;= box1.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.zmin &gt;= box2.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.zmin &gt;= box1.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code>

	<h3>Draw boxes in the correct order.</h3>

	<p>
In general, <u>a box should not be drawn until all the ones behind it are
drawn</u>.  Thus, we begin by drawing the boxes that have nothing behind them.
Then, we can draw the boxes that are only in front of those that are already
drawn. This process continues until all boxes are drawn. (See Figure 4 below
for an example.)
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure7" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 4: (1) Nothing is behind blue, so draw it first. (2) Draw green next
since blue was the only one behind it and is already drawn.  (3) Then draw red,
since both blocks that were behind it have been drawn.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
To implement this algorithm, each box must know exactly which boxes are behind
it.  We have already determined how to do this in the last section.  A search
must be implemented so that each box has a list of boxes behind it.
	</p>

	<p>
You are now armed with everything you need to know to render isometric boxes in
the correct order.
	</p>

	<h3>A conundrum</h3>

	<p>
It is possible to have a situation seen in the figure below.  The aforementioned drawing
methods dictate that we first draw the box with nothing behind it, but this example illustrates
a case where this cannot be done.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure8" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Here are three boxes intertwined in a way such that one is always behind
another.  This prevents us from drawing a first box.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The figure above cheats by segmenting the orange box into two.
This is one method of breaking this type of cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
There are formal methods used for detecting
such cycles mentioned in the appendix.  After detection of a cycle, the blocks in that cycle
could be drawn with special clipping regions to respect front boxes or to segment a block or blocks
that will break the cycle.  These are solutions that I will be exploring and updating this article as
my experiments progress.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Appendix</h2>

	<h4>A formal description of the solution</h4>

	<p>
This is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's Algorithm</a>,
which handles occlusion by drawing back-to-front.
	</p>

	<p>
For those who are interested, our method for determining if hexagons and boxes
are overlapping is a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Also, the way in which we determined the drawing order of the boxes is known in graph theory as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>,
which is essentially a depth-first search of a directed graph.
	</p>

	<p>
You can build a directed graph of the <em>boxes</em>, with directed edges to
the boxes that are behind it.  Topologically sorting this graph will produce an
ordered list of boxes that can be drawn in that exact order.
	</p>

	<p>
Mathematicians will recognize this directed graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered
set</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Finally, to prevent the aforementioned cycle conundrum, we can use <a href="">Tarjan's
strongly connection components</a> algorithm.  After computing these cycles,
one could either split a block to prevent a cycle, or to use a clipping region
to prevent drawing over any blocks that are supposed to be in front of it.
	</p>

	<h4>Alternative Solutions</h4>

	<p>
You may be able to just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffering</a>,
though drawing order is still important for transparent sprites.  Also, if all
bounding boxes are unit cubes, sorting is much simpler.
	</p>

	<h4>Full example of working code</h4>

	<p>
All the diagrams above were created using a simple isometric box renderer
written in Javascript, which applies all the techniques described in this
article.  You can study the fully annotated source code on <a href="https://github.com/shaunew/IsometricBlocks">IsometricBlocks project on
GitHub</a>.

<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

<ul>
<li>it's probably not very mobile friendly (it's barely desktop friendly!)</li>
<li>SVG support varies among web browsers, so there might be some minor artifacts (chromium works better, but firefox works well enough)</li>
<li>navbar centering isn't broken on this page – it's just a temporary hack to fit in the diagram till I figure out wide pages properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

February 25, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-demands-733-million-euros-in-fines-from-food-delivery-platforms/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-demands-733-million-euros-in-fines-from-food-delivery-platforms/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Milan prosecutors and the Italian Labour Inspectorate have jointly <a href="https://www.ispettorato.gov.it/it-it/notizie/Documents/Comunicato%20stampaTutele%20riders.pdf" target="_blank">ordered</a> four major food delivery platforms to fully hire over 60,000 couriers — and pay a total of €733 million in fines.</p>
<p>Couriers who worked for Uber Eats, Glovo, Just Eat and Deliveroo in Italy from 2017 to 2020 must now be treated as "coordinated and continuous workers," prosecutors declared.</p>
<p>If the companies pay the fines within 90 days, they will be able to avoid criminal proceedings — but legal experts say it's a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Should the platforms hire all 60,000 couriers, there's a high price to pay to catch up on previous, missed social security payments, said European labor law specialist Luca de Vecchi. Social security contributions in Italy can amount to up to 33 percent of an employee's salary and must be paid by the employer.</p>
<p>This poses a "very difficult decision" for the companies, de Vecchi added. Trying to appeal and fight the case in court risks criminal sanctions on the company managers, but accepting the fines could lead to the companies' demise. </p>
<p>"I don't know how they could manage to pay and remain alive," he said.</p>
<h3>Health and safety</h3>
<p>The sanctions are linked to alleged violations of health and safety regulations, following an investigation into driver accidents.</p>
<p>"It is no longer the time to say that riders are slaves, the time has come to say that they are citizens who need legal protection," said Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Greco in an online press conference, according to <a href="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" target="_blank">Italian media</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a very heavy blow to the platform narrative, to their business model based on false autonomy and the abuse of occasional work, on the denial of any right and the infringement of laws and contracts," added the Deliverance Milano syndicate group in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deliverancemilano/posts/2734640120180349" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. "There is no more time to waste: hiring and rights immediately, enough with precariousness and exploitation!"</p>

<p>The Assodelivery group — which represents the likes of Uber, Deliveroo, Glovo and JustEat — said they were "surprised" by the prosecutor's decision.</p>
<p>"The platforms, despite the specific differences, have operated in recent years in compliance with current regulations, including the classification of workers and workplace safety regulations," the group said in an emailed statement. "We therefore disagree with the picture illustrated today."</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Attention will now turn to the platforms, and "whether they will go back to negotiate with the minister of labour and the representative trade unions to try to solve the issue," said labor law expert Valerio de Stefano.</p>
<p>A negotiated settlement might be the most likely outcome, de Vecchi said. </p>
<p>"I think that at the end of the story there will be a compromise solution that will allow these companies to stay active — probably a limited fine without any criminal prosecution," said de Vecchi. "But on the other end, they will be forced to change their operational model and to have a different standard in terms of employees' rights and guarantees."</p>
<p>The ruling comes off the back of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1618801">U.K. supreme court ruling</a> that declared Uber drivers to be "workers" rather than self-employed contractors, as well as a recent <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1612457">Dutch appeals court decision</a> that Deliveroo drivers are employees — signs of changing times in the gig economy. </p>

<p>"What's for sure is that it is basically more and more clear: we cannot pretend anymore that these people are just genuinely self-employed as if they were small undertakings — they are workers that should be protected as such," de Stefano said.</p>

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<hr>


<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin is screwed</h2>

<p>I just realized that Bitcoin is screwed.</p>

<p>I just came across a digital currency system called Taler that solves the double spending problem by having a central authority, and makes certain provisions for levying taxes, but is also reasonably anonymous, like cash.</p>

<p>This is the best system for money I've ever seen. It's like Visa/Mastercard, but open source and with buyer anonymity. No one knows what you spend your stuff on. But everyone knows what you earned your stuff with. So it can be used within existing governments.</p>

<p>And here's the thing. The reason Bitcoin has perverse incentives for energy use, and for that reason is inherently expensive, slow and inflexible, is that it wants to do without a central authority.</p>

<p>But it's a mirage. Bitcoin can't do without a central authority. There are no power stations without a central authority. Someone has to own them, and operate them. None of that works without a central authority. It does in the little colored books of the Libertarian ideologues, who are surprised time and time again when getting rid of the government actually does not magically solve all problems. But put it to the test- nope, can't run a power station without a working legal system. Can't produce chips and have a computer supply chain without a working legal system. Everything you need to produce Bitcoins depends on the existence of technologically advanced, government-regulated civilization.</p>

<p>And if you have that- why bother doing without a central authority? Just use the darn government to solve the double spending problem. You're already doing that with Bitcoin, just in a convoluted, perversely inefficient, comically inept Rube Goldberg machine kind of way.</p>

<p>In other words- Bitcoin broke its own promise before it ever left the laboritory. It was never designed to be decentralized. It came as close as is humanely possible by all means, but quite simply by needing electricity and advanced silicon, it's doomed. In other words, Bitcoin never was what claimed to be. It's main virtue is that it's pretty good at obfuscating that.</p>

<p>For this reason, I believe that Bitcoin is going to experience a series of booms and busts, but it will never play a significant role in organizing society, building schools and bridges, banking the unbanked, and lifting people out of powverty. But Taler might.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve only used Twitter for a few months and I did like a lot of it. The best part by far was following and listening to some incredible people. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a> is one among many, but if you look at what he says on a daily basis, you’ll know what I mean. I can be endlessly entertained and learn a lot from what folks like him say.</p>
<p>There’s also the feeling of being the first one to know things. I often came across news or memes well before everyone else who wasn’t on twitter. Jan 6th, 2021 was a good example. I spent the whole day refreshing twitter, horrified by what I saw. It didn’t make a difference whether I learned of what was happening in 5 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days, but on that day I <em>needed</em> to know in real time.</p>
<p>As for tweeting myself, I did it a fair bit. Before twitter, I’d have this habit of wanting to share whatever interesting tidbit I found with at least one person. Something funny? To the college/school group chat it goes. Something to do with software? To my former flatmates. Cute animal? To my wife. Whatever I see, I know at least one friend who’d like it. I felt happy showing it to at least one other person. But I also felt a bit guilty sending them to people on 1:1 threads. Was I being too spammy? Were my ‘jokes’ not that funny? That’s where Twitter helped. I could broadcast without worrying that I was bothering people.</p>
<p>I also liked sending encouragement and appreciation to small time authors and content creators. These folks have it tough, and a kind word can always help. Twitter reduces the friction to doing this to the point where there’s no reason you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty good website, as tens of millions of people around the world can attest. I would mostly agree with them. But it wasn’t for me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-1---lack-of-reach">Problem 1 - Lack of reach</h2>
<p>It feels stupid to complain about something as trivial as a lack of followers. There are ways to get around this, chiefly by putting out interesting content. I never used hashtags much, but that’s supposedly a great way too. But I never saw much engagement with what I was saying, which meant using the website felt a bit solitary. What was the point of saying things if I was the only one reading it?</p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m a boring knob, and that’s why no one reacted to my stuff. But that’s not been my experience elsewhere. When I use reddit or Hacker News, I find that it’s trivial to get thousands of karma and a handful of awards. Pseudo-anonymity helps too - instead of a weird Indian name I use a nickname that doesn’t mean anything. It’s possible to get positive engagement and replies from people regardless of who you are. You don’t need a reputation or a following, if you said something worth reading, people will read it and appreciate.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest - I felt jealous that people could just say “hey followers, here’s a question I could have googled. Could you google it for me?” and get a response. Or “I’m looking for a job. Any leads?” I didn’t have that. Nor did I have a way of reaching that easily.</p>
<p>I think Tiktok gets it right here. No matter who the creator is, if the content is good enough it will get hundreds of thousands of views. That system feels fairer to than Twitter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-2---pervasive-anger">Problem 2 - Pervasive anger</h2>
<p>I followed a lot of interesting people, but these folks were also upset with many things, mainly the state of the world. Watching people snipe at each other constantly, taking their anger out on anything in sight … was understandable. You can’t tell them to react differently or to chill out, because these are reasonable responses to what they’re seeing. I can’t even disagree.</p>
<p>But seeing people angry most of the time takes it’s toll too. I think it affected my mental health. Yes, I’m deeply upset with some of the things that are happening, but if I’m thinking about them 24x7 I’m not thinking about urgent things in my life that need my attention.</p>
<p>I won’t miss people dunking on each other while also not mentioning the dunkee, piquing my curiosity to the point where I investigate who the dunkee was and why. A waste of time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-3---twitter-warps-people">Problem 3 - Twitter warps people</h2>
<p>Some guy with 14k followers said something. It was something like “only Indian people are rude/assholes in this particular way. Here are some anecdotes proving this”. This is a generalisation about a race of people based on anecdotes, so by definition racist. But since the person was Indian, it’s not. Don’t look at me, I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p>Dunking on other Indian people is a common pastime for Indian people - it makes us feel superior to our compatriots. Of course we wouldn’t do the thing that we’re talking about, we’re better than that. He wasn’t doing anything I haven’t heard a hundred others do.</p>
<p>I commented that there could be sampling bias here. Since we’re more likely to be annoyed/embarassed by the actions of Indian people, we’re more likely to notice and remember it. I relayed an anecdote of my Indian friend being very annoyed by something an Indian did but not even remembering that a white person had done the exact same thing the previous day (making us wait while taking a photo). I thought it was ok to say this. I asked “You ever think this is sampling bias? You notice and get annoyed when Indians do it and embarrass you but don’t if it’s someone else?”</p>
<p>Apparently not. He went on a massive tirade. Not content with responding rudely, he quote tweets me so he can dunk in front of all his followers. Apparently, I’m jingoistic deflector, part of the “elite” that refuses to “accept and introspect” and that I “deny deny deny” legitimate issues with India. If you’ve read my other posts, you know this isn’t true. I’m the first one to point out where my country (and me personally) can do better. (<a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/understanding-my-privilege/">Understanding my Privilege</a>, <a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/discriminating-against-left-handers/">Discriminating against left handers</a>)</p>
<p>Anyway, he has 14k followers. I have 100. I wasn’t winning this one, regardless. I decided to stop responding, even though he went on and on.</p>
<p>The thing is, he’s actually a pretty good dude. I know, because I’ve followed him for months. But at some point he’s been exposed to so much trolling that he assumes that everyone who disagrees is a troll. It’s “#factcheckbait” according to him. He thought I was a troll and responded appropriately.</p>
<p>How does a reasonable, good person end up warped like this, where they assume that every person out there is a bad faith actor? Where there’s absolutely no scope for disagreement? My theory is that Twitter warps people in this way, by simply removing any scope for reasoned discussion. When you only meet trolls, and never have any friendly discussion with different viewpoints, you assume that a person disagreeing with you is a troll.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could stick around, play the game, build up by follower count to the point where I solve problem 1, prune my followee list to solve problem 2. But by then I’ve probably spent so much time there that I’ve become warped, probably without realising it - problem 3. Once I figured this out, I deactivated my account.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t permanent. The upsides of twitter still exist. I still want to read what people like Patrick McKenzie, Zach Weinersmith, John Carmack and others have to say. I still want to send encouraging messages to small time creators. But for now, I’m done.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p><em>TL;DR: Currently there’s no common boot scheme across architectures and
platforms for open-source operating systems. There’s also little cooperation
between multiple distributions in dual-boot (or triple, … multi-boot)
setups. We’d like to improve this situation by getting everybody to commit to a
single boot configuration format that is based on drop-in files, and thus is
robust, simple, works without rewriting configuration files and is free of
namespace clashes.</em></p>

<p>The Boot Loader Specification defines a scheme how different operating systems
can cooperatively manage a boot loader configuration directory, that accepts
drop-in files for boot menu items that are defined in a format that is shared
between various boot loader implementations, operating systems, and userspace
programs. The same scheme can be used to prepare OS media for cases where the
firmware includes a boot loader. The target audience for this specification is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boot loader developers, to write a boot loader that directly reads its configuration at runtime from these drop-in snippets</li>
  <li>Firmware developers, to add generic boot loading support directly to the firmware itself</li>
  <li>Distribution and Core OS developers, in order to create these snippets at OS/kernel package installation time</li>
  <li>UI developers, for implementing a user interface that discovers the available boot options</li>
  <li>OS Installer developers, to prepare their installation media and for setting up the initial drop-in directory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-there-a-need-for-this-specification">Why is there a need for this specification?</h2>

<p>Of course, without this specification things already work mostly fine. But here’s why we think this specification is needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To make the boot more robust, as no explicit rewriting of configuration files is required any more</li>
  <li>To allow an out of the box boot experience on any platform without the need of traditional firmware mechanisms (e.g. BIOS calls, UEFI Boot Services)</li>
  <li>To improve dual-boot scenarios. Currently, multiple Linux installations tend to fight over which boot loader becomes the primary one in possession of the MBR, and only that one installation can then update the boot loader configuration of it freely. Other Linux installs have to be manually configured to never touch the MBR and instead install a chain-loaded boot loader in their own partition headers. In this new scheme as all installations share a loader directory no manual configuration has to take place, and all participants implicitly cooperate due to removal of name collisions and can install/remove their own boot menu entries at free will, without interfering with the entries of other installed operating systems.</li>
  <li>Drop-in directories are otherwise now pretty ubiquitous on Linux as an easy way to extend configuration without having to edit, regenerate or manipulate configuration files. For the sake of uniformity, we should do the same for extending the boot menu.</li>
  <li>Userspace code can sanely parse boot loader configuration which is essential with modern BIOSes which do not necessarily initialize USB keyboards anymore during boot, which makes boot menus hard to reach for the user. If userspace code can parse the boot loader configuration, too, this allows for UIs that can select a boot menu item to boot into, before rebooting the machine, thus not requiring interactivity during early boot.</li>
  <li>To unify and thus simplify configuration of the various boot loaders around, which makes configuration of the boot loading process easier for users, administrators and developers alike.</li>
  <li>For boot loaders with configuration <em>scripts</em> such as grub2, adopting this spec allows for mostly static scripts that are generated only once at first installation, but then do not need to be updated anymore as that is done via drop-in files exclusively.</li>
</ul>



<p>EFI is not ubiquitous, especially not in embedded systems. If you have an EFI
system, it provides a boot options logic that can offer similar
functionality. Here’s why we think that it is not enough for our uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The various EFI implementations implement the boot order/boot item logic to different levels. Some firmware implementations do not offer a boot menu at all and instead unconditionally follow the EFI boot order, booting the first item that is working.</li>
  <li>If the firmware setup is used to reset all data usually all EFI boot entries are lost, making the system entirely unbootable, as the firmware setups generally do not offer a UI to define additional boot items. By placing the menu item information on disk, it is always available, regardless if the BIOS setup data is lost.</li>
  <li>Harddisk images should be movable between machines and be bootable without requiring explicit EFI variables to be set. This also requires that the list of boot options is defined on disk, and not in EFI variables alone.</li>
  <li>EFI is not universal yet (especially on non-x86 platforms), this specification is useful both for EFI and non-EFI boot loaders.</li>
  <li>Many EFI systems disable USB support during early boot to optimize boot times, thus making keyboard input unavailable in the EFI menu. It is thus useful if the OS UI has a standardized way to discover available boot options which can be booted to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Everything described below is located on a placeholder file system <code>$BOOT</code>. The installer program should pick <code>$BOOT</code> according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On disks with an MBR partition table:
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, and a partition with the type id of 0xEA already exists it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, a new partition with type id of 0xEA shall be created, of a suitable size (let’s say 500MB), and it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On disks with GPT (GUID Partition Table)
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an Extended Boot Loader Partition or XBOOTLDR partition for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type GUID of <code>bc13c2ff-59e6-4262-a352-b275fd6f7172</code>, already exists, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an EFI System Partition or ESP for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type UID of <code>c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b</code>) already exists and is large enough (let’s say 250MB) and otherwise qualifies, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and if the ESP partition already exists but is too small, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) XBOOTLDR partition shall be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and no ESP partition exists yet, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) ESP should be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This placeholder file system shall be determined during <em>installation time</em>, and an fstab entry may be created. It should be mounted to either <code>/boot/</code> or <code>/efi/</code>. Additional locations like <code>/boot/efi/</code>, with <code>/boot/</code> being a separate file system, might be supported by implementations. This is not recommended because the mounting of <code>$BOOT</code> is then dependent on and requires the mounting of the intermediate file system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em><code>$BOOT</code> should be considered <strong>shared</strong> among all OS installations of a system. Instead of maintaining one <code>$BOOT</code> per installed OS (as <code>/boot/</code> was traditionally handled), all installed OS share the same place to drop in their boot-time configuration.</em></p>

<p>For systems where the firmware is able to read file systems directly, <code>$BOOT</code>
must be a file system readable by the firmware. For other systems and generic
installation and live media, <code>$BOOT</code> must be a VFAT (16 or 32) file
system. Applications accessing <code>$BOOT</code> should hence not assume that fancier
file system features such as symlinks, hardlinks, access control or case
sensitivity are supported.</p>

<p>This specification defines two types of boot loader entries. The first type is
text based, very simple and suitable for a variety of firmware, architecture
and image types (“Type #1”). The second type is specific to EFI, but allows
single-file images that embed all metadata in the kernel binary itself, which
is useful to cryptographically sign them as one file for the purpose of
SecureBoot (“Type #2”).</p>

<p>Not all boot loader entries will apply to all systems. For example, Type #1
entries that use the <code>efi</code> key and all Type #2 entries only apply to EFI
systems. Entries using the <code>architecture</code> key might specify an architecture that
doesn’t match the local one. Boot loaders should ignore all entries that don’t
match the local platform and what the boot loader can support, and hide them
from the user. Only entries matching the feature set of boot loader and system
shall be considered and displayed. This allows image builders to put together
images that transparently support multiple different architectures.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>$BOOT</code> partition is not supposed to be exclusive territory of
this specification. This specification only defines semantics of the <code>/loader/</code>
directory inside the file system (see below), but it doesn’t intend to define
ownership of the whole file system exclusively. Boot loaders, firmware, and
other software implementing this specification may choose to place other
files and directories in the same file system. For example, boot loaders that
implement this specification might install their own boot code into the <code>$BOOT</code>
partition. On systems where <code>$BOOT</code> is the ESP this is a particularly common
setup. Implementations of this specification must be able to operate correctly
if files or directories other than <code>/loader/</code> are found in the top level
directory. Implementations that add their own files or directories to the file
systems should use well-named directories, to make name collisions between
multiple users of the file system unlikely.</p>

<h3 id="type-1-boot-loader-specification-entries">Type #1 Boot Loader Specification Entries</h3>

<p>We define two directories below <code>$BOOT</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/</code> is the directory containing all files needed for Type #1 entries</li>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/entries/</code> is the directory containing the drop-in snippets. This directory contains one <code>.conf</code> file for each boot menu item.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In all cases the <code>/loader/</code> directory should be …</em></p></div></div>

Internet users have gotten increasingly discerning when it comes to search. When they type a keyword into your website's search bar, they expect to find logically ranked results, including related matches and misspellings.</p>
<p>Because users are used to these sophisticated search systems, developers have to build applications that use more than simple <code>LIKE</code> queries. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Postgres Full Text Search</a> has been available since Postgres 8.3. It can be used to <strong>find records based on semantics and knowledge of the language</strong> rather than simple string matching, is very flexible, and unlike other search options such as <code>LIKE</code>, it performs well for partial matches.</p>
<p>While <code>LIKE</code> can be supported by indexes, that usually won’t work well when the <code>%</code> operator is used on the left side of the search term. Typically this means the query planner reverts to sequential scans when using wildcard operators like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title <span>FROM</span> film <span>WHERE</span> description <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%brilliant'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When searching multiple columns, you also have additional effort, as each column needs to be queried separately using <code>LIKE</code>. There are more flexible alternatives, such as <code>SIMILAR TO</code> and POSIX regular expression search, but those are still difficult to use when you want to catch different variations of a word (e.g., word variations like “jump,” “jumps,” “jumped,” and “jumping”).</p>
<p>Because <code>LIKE</code> and other simple methods lack language support and cannot handle word variations or ranking, Postgres Full Text Search (FTS) is generally a better option when implementing search directly in the database. With FTS, your searches will match all instances of the word, its plural, and the word's various tenses. Because FTS is bundled into Postgres, there’s no need to install extra software and no extra cost for using a third-party search provider. Additionally, all your data are stored in one place, which reduces your web application’s complexity.</p>
<p>This article will show you how to use Full Text Search in raw PostgreSQL queries and implement equivalent queries in Django using the Postgres driver. Along the way, you’ll see some of the use cases for the various Full Text Search methods that Postgres provides.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search"><a href="#core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search" aria-label="core concepts of postgres full text search permalink"></a>Core Concepts of Postgres Full Text Search</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL provides several native functions for Full Text Search. In the following sections, you’ll see how to use them to “vectorize” your results and search queries so that you can use Postgres’s Full Text Search features.</p>
<h3 id="tsvector-data-type"><a href="#tsvector-data-type" aria-label="tsvector data type permalink"></a>tsvector data type</h3>
<p>Before a text or document can be searched using FTS, you need to convert it to an acceptable data type, known as a <code>tsvector</code>. To convert plain text to a <code>tsvector</code>, use the Postgres <code>to_tsvector</code> function. This function reduces the original text to a set of word skeletons known as lexemes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme">Lexemes</a> are important because they help match related words. For instance, the words <em>satisfy</em>, <em>satisfying</em> and <em>satisfied</em> would convert to <em>satisfi</em>. This means a search for <em>satisfy</em> will return results containing any of the other terms as well. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-dictionaries.html#TEXTSEARCH-STOPWORDS">Stop words</a> such as “a,” “on,” “of,” “you,” “who,” etc. are removed because they appear too frequently to be relevant in searches. The <code>to_tsvector</code> function returns the lexemes, along with a digit that denotes each word’s position in the text.</p>
<p>Note that the output of the function is language-dependent. You should tell PostgreSQL to treat the text as English (or whatever language your results are stored in). To convert the sentence “A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank” to a <code>tsvector</code>, run the following:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll see output like the following:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'chase':12 'documentari':3 'fanci':2 'frisbe':6 'lumberjack':9 'monkey':14 'must':11 'shark':17 'tank':18</code></pre></div>
<p>This shows each word’s root as well as its position in the text. For example, the word fanciful, the second word in the text, has been broken down into the lexeme “fanci”, so you see <code>’fanci’:2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tsquery-data-type"><a href="#tsquery-data-type" aria-label="tsquery data type permalink"></a>tsquery data type</h3>
<p>Text search systems have two major components: the text being searched and the keyword being searched for. In the case of FTS, both components must be vectorized. You saw how searchable data is converted to a <code>tsvector</code> in the previous section, so now you’ll see how search terms are vectorized into <code>tsquery</code> values.</p>
<p>Postgres offers functions that will convert text fields to <code>tsquery</code> values such as <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code> and <code>phraseto_tsquery</code>. Search terms can also be combined with the <code>&amp;</code> (AND), <code>|</code> (OR), and <code>!</code> (NOT) operators, and parentheses can be used to group operators and determine their order. <code>to_tsquery</code> converts the search terms to tokens and discards stop words.</p>
<p>The following query:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a &amp; beautifully &amp; very &amp; quickly'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Returns the lexemes “beauti” and “quick” because “a” and “very” are stop words:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'beauti' &amp; 'quick'</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="searching"><a href="#searching" aria-label="searching permalink"></a>Searching</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to create a <code>tsvector</code> from your text data and a <code>tsquery</code> from your search terms, you can perform a full-text search using the <code>@@</code> operator.</p>
<p>For example, you can run the following query to compare two strings:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'John''s performance was found wanting'</span><span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'want'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This query returns <code>TRUE</code>, indicating that there was a match: <code>want</code>.</p>
<p>If you had a <code>film</code> table containing movie titles and descriptions, you could use Full Text Search to find all films with a description containing the word <em>epic</em> and either of the words <em>tale</em> or <em>story</em>:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title<span>,</span> description <span>FROM</span> film
<span>WHERE</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span>description<span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'epic &amp; (story | tale)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would give you results similar to this:</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3 id="ranking"><a href="#ranking" aria-label="ranking permalink"></a>Ranking</h3>
<p>Ranking search results can ensure that the most relevant results are shown first. Postgres provides <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">two functions for ranking</a> search results: <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rankcd</code>. <code>ts_rank</code> considers the frequency of words, while <code>ts_rank_cd</code> (“cd” means “coverage density”) considers the position of search terms within the text being searched.</p>
<p>If you run the following query, you’ll see that <code>rank1</code> and <code>rank2</code> are ranked the same (<code>0.06078271</code>) because each search query is found once in the sentence:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>

<p>The more tokens that match the text, the higher the rank. In the following example, <code>rank1</code> has a higher rank than <code>rank2</code> because the tokens “elephant” and “dolphin” are both found in the sentence while “snake” is not:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant &amp; dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin &amp; snake'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="weighting"><a href="#weighting" aria-label="weighting permalink"></a>Weighting</h3>
<p>You can also give relevance to some factors over others by weighing them. For instance, when searching the film table, the highest weight could be given to the movie title and less weight could be given to the description using the <code>setweight</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>
<span>SELECT</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> weight<span>;</span>


<span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> elephant_rank<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> dolphin_rank<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elephant_rank</code> is ranked higher because it matched elephant which has a higher weight of A, compared to dolphin_rank which has a weight of B.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>| elephant_rank | dolphin_rank |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0.6079271     | 0.24317084   |</code></pre></div>
<p><code>ts_rank</code> takes an optional first argument, <strong>weight</strong>. When this argument is left empty, it defaults to “{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}” in the order D, C, B, A. By default, A has the highest weight of 1.0, B has 0.4, C has 0.2, and D has 0.1. You can set the weight of any of A, B, C, or D to a different value using any decimal between -0.1 and 1.0. This allows you to have fine-grained control over how results are returned and ensure that users see the right results for their queries.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how to use Postgres’ Full Text Search functions, you’re ready to start applying these ideas to your Django app.</p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django"><a href="#using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django" aria-label="using postgresql full text search in django permalink"></a>Using PostgreSQL Full Text Search in Django</h2>
<p>Using Postgres’ Full Text Search in Django is an ideal way to add accurate and fast search because it is easy to maintain and fast to work with. To demonstrate Full Text Search in Django, consider a PostgreSQL database <code>dvdrental</code>, with a <code>film</code> table, and an equivalent <code>Film</code> model in a Django application implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> Models

<span>class</span> <span>Film</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    film_id <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>AutoField<span>(</span>primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    title <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>255</span><span>)</span>
    description <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>TextField<span>(</span>blank<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> null<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>', '</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'film_id='</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span>self<span>.</span>film_id<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'title='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>title<span>,</span> <span>'description='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>description<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the remainder of this article, you’ll see how to search a single database table field, search multiple fields, rank search results, and optimize the performance of Full text Search using vector fields and indexes. You can run the commands from your <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">Python shell</a>.</p>

					<p>It was in 2016 when the trike design has developed its first shapes and got a wider recognition. Artūras Mikalauskas – the founder – found a design student –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43993905/AKO-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Lukas Avėnas</i></a> – who was crazy enough to jump on such a venture. With the mentorship &amp; ideology suggestions from Artūras, they have successfully created the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://lukasavenas.com/ako-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKO Trike concept design</a></em>. Later that year, Lukas won the Young Designers Award for his design. Since then, Artūras initiated the build of a first concept-proof prototype.</p>

<p>While Elon Musk was updating about the Starlink internet speed increase via a tweet last evening, a follower presented the idea of a mini portable Starlink dish, and Musk affirmed that it is a good idea.</p>



<p>SpaceX is currently working on system upgrades that might result in higher Starlink internet speeds at times. In response to a question about when Starlink will be available in the Bay Area, “Probably mid-year (2021), but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet,” SpaceX CEO <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> said.</p>



<p>The idea of an even more compact, probably sub-1ft diameter dish is praised by Elon Musk, and looking at his past record, he might actually make this happen. A smaller dish that is easier to carry during remote excursions with chargeable batteries could be a perfect travel companion.</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> going to production later this year, many Starlink customers who will own the Cybertruck will want to take the mini dish with them on their journeys. Since the Cybertruck will have power outlets and a huge battery pack inside, powering a small Starlink dish for long periods of time will not be an issue for this electric pickup truck.</p>



<p>We asked a recent <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> beta customer about how much internet speeds he is getting with his new dish installed on the roof of his home. Brian is getting from min 40 Mbps to max 177 Mbps with Starlink depending on the hour of the day or night. He is getting an average speed of 81 Mbps, not so bad. The silver lining is that with time, the speeds are only going to get better and better.</p>

<p>For internet users on Gbps rated connections, this speed might look slow but there is a large number of users even in the developed world who have a 1 – 5 Mbps connection at home. For example, Christ T. Bridgwater from England, Great Britain just upgraded to Starlink from a legacy 900 kbps connection, just imagine his experience coming from such low-speed internet, he says:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I’m on beta – just thank you. 11 years waiting for a connection which is better than 900kbps 🙂 thank you</p><cite>Chrs T. Bridgwater. England, GB</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> is building the Starlink satellite constellation in the lower earth orbit (LEO). 60 more Starlinks were deployed last week but sadly the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/16/spacex-falcon-9-lost-landing-starlink-launch/">Falcon 9 missed the landing this time</a> and fell into the ocean. Events like these won’t hinder the development of the next-gen internet service provider, exciting times ahead.</p>

<p>On December 24, 2020, the Delhi high court conducted its first hearing for the ongoing case against Alexandra Elbakyan’s website Sci-Hub, an online repository of academic literature that allows users free access to its contents.</p>
<p>It is not unknown that websites like Sci-Hub and Libgen (portmanteau of ‘Library Genesis’) are important for scholars and students alike in India who can’t afford individual subscriptions to academic journals.</p>


<p>However, academic publishers Elsevier Ltd., Wiley Pvt. Ltd. and the American Chemical Society sued Sci-Hub and Libgen for copyright infringement in India and asked for the country’s IT ministry to block access to these sites.</p>
<p>The court’s next hearing is scheduled for February 23. In an exclusive interview to <em>The Wire Science</em>, <strong>Alexandra Elbakyan</strong> spoke of her own days in college, where she said she first felt the need for a tool like Sci-Hub, the legal issues between Elsevier and Sci-Hub around the world, and the tension between piracy and sharing.</p>
<p><em>Excerpts from the interview are presented below, with a few minor edits for style.</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you tell me about your own college experience at Satbayev University, Kazakhstan, in the absence of portals like Sci-Hub? Were there specific difficulties you faced that led to the conception of Sci-Hub?</strong></p>
<p>I first stumbled upon academic paywalls when I was in my final year of study. I studied information technologies, and specialised in infosecurity. Since middle school I was interested in neuroscience, too, so I wanted to combine both fields in my final year project. I started to work on brain-machine interfaces and set up a task to develop a system that can use brainwaves as passwords, in the same way you can use your fingerprint to unlock a computer.</p>
<p>I started searching for information and that was when I first learned that academic journals exist at all. Today, there are people who use Sci-Hub while they study in school, but I was quite old when I started with research.</p>
<p>So, I located the articles that were interesting for my topic on websites such as IEEE or ScienceDirect and almost all of them were paywalled. I was not concerned. For a long time since school, I was using various technologies which made science movies, books and software freely available. So I was sure there was some website to download academic articles for free.</p>
<p>I googled and googled but found nothing! Then I was quite surprised and frustrated, but after a long search I found some forums such as passfans or myescience where people shared passwords to access university libraries. Using these passwords, I was able to enter universities that had subscriptions to these journals and download articles for free.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea to develop a software program that people can use to download academic articles automatically. The design I imagined then was quite different from Sci-Hub, but it was the same idea. I tried discussing it on forums but it did not cause a lot of interest, and I forgot about it for a while. I graduated from university and travelled abroad. I developed Sci-Hub two years later.</p>
<p><strong>Despite a series of lawsuits for copyright infringement, Sci-Hub is not widely thought of as a pirate, and has found acceptance among scholars. What would you say about this?</strong></p>
<p>Today, most scientists view the academic publishing system as fundamentally unjust and exploitative. The problem is that publishers are not actual creators of these works, scientists are – they do all the work, and academic publishers simply use their position of power in the Republic of Science to extract unjust profits. Sci-Hub does not enable piracy where creative people are deprived of the reward they deserve. It is a very different thing.</p>
<p>What does one mean by the word ‘piracy’? Only after several years was I able to comprehend how some people use this word in a bad sense. Most scientists do not care about the legal status at all. They want to do science, and they need to access academic literature to do it, and these legal things — they are in a different reality that scholars do not belong to at all, another planet or a different universe.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/science/how-scihub-is-at-the-forefront-of-the-quest-to-frame-scientific-knowledge-as-public-good/">How Sci-Hub Is at the Forefront of the Quest to Frame Scientific Knowledge as Public Good</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>How much do authors earn from the money paid to cross an academic publisher’s paywall?&nbsp;Can you talk about how publishers exercise their power?</strong></p>
<p>The careers of researchers depend on journal publications. To receive funding or secure positions at the university, a scientist must have publications in ‘high-impact’ academic journals. Most of these journals today belong to corporations like Elsevier, Wiley and Springer-Nature.</p>
<p>Researchers do the actual work: they invent the hypothesis, do the experiments and write the articles describing the results of these experiments. Then they publish this article in an academic journal. They cannot simply put this article online on their blog: to be recognised as research work, it must be published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. So they send their articles to publishers like Elsevier, Wiley or Springer.</p>
<p>Publishers send articles they have received to other scientists for peer-review. Reviewers give their opinion on whether the work should be accepted in a journal or not, or if some additional work must be done. Based on these reviews, the article is published or rejected.</p>
<p>Both reviewers and scientists work for free. They do not earn any compensation from the academic publisher. Here, academic publishers work as organisers of the academic community, but not as creators. The work of the academic publisher is organisational and not creative.</p>
<p><strong>And yet, Elsevier Ltd. has sued Sci-Hub in the US, Sweden, Belgium and France, lobbied for a block in Russia, and now it has filed a lawsuit in India. It’s often the same group of publishers that takes action against Sci-Hub: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, the American Chemical Society. Why do you think it is this group?</strong></p>
<p>Because most academic works and the most popular works in Sci-Hub’s database are from these publishers, and Elsevier is the leading one in numbers. These companies form an oligopoly that currently controls all academic communication. These publishers alone perhaps control the majority of science. They are key players.</p>
<p>Sci-Hub’s view is that science should not be controlled by a few big companies but it should be a dynamic network of learned societies.</p>
<p><strong>In the last hearing on January 6, 2021, the Delhi High Court deemed the case to be of public importance, and allowed scholars to register their concerns with the court. You claimed many Twitter users were tweeting at the Sci-Hub account and you were archiving these tweets. But on January 8, Twitter suspended Sci-Hub’s account. Can you tell me the extent to which Twitter’s move affected your ability to defend your case?</strong></p>
<p>On Sci-Hub’s Twitter account, anyone could see right away that no researcher today supports what publishers do and everyone thinks that academic research should be free to access. It was very obvious and visible on the Sci-Hub account, and people who wanted to support Sci-Hub had a place to do it.</p>
<p>Now of course after the Sci-Hub account has been banned there are fewer people voicing their opinions about Sci-Hub, because the discussion platform is gone, so there are fewer supportive comments, and the support of Sci-Hub is not as obvious as it has previously been. However, in my view it will not seriously affect the ability to defend the current case in India.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/sci-hub-case-india-academic-publishing-access-alexandra-elbakyan-twitter-account-suspension/">Curious Timing: As Sci-Hub Case Takes off in India, Twitter Suspends Its Account</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>The number of cases against you have shot up in the last five years. Would you be comfortable about sharing how this has affected you as an individual?</strong></p>
<p>Researchers depend on Sci-Hub and I feel a need to support its users, I cannot simply abandon them. I love academic literature and knowledge, and I love working on Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is nine years old already and it has become a fundamental part of my life. I never thought about abandoning Sci-Hub actually. I have a dream to make academic literature free and I work on it consistently.</p>
<p>Currently the lawsuits have not targeted or affected me directly. I was ordered to pay Elsevier 15 million dollars in damages but I am able to ignore a United States order right now. But what might happen in the future?</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to those who argue that it is naïve to expect a system of unhindered exchange of information to thrive, and that publishing houses have a right over the knowledge that they publish?</strong></p>
<p>What is naive and dangerous is to expect science to thrive when information exchange is hindered. And as I said before, science should not be controlled by a few big corporations. That is detrimental to science.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/intro.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Introduction"></p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state of a document.</p>

<p>The advent of these features led to browsers not only rendering HTML documents, but also providing an in-memory representation of the document called the Document Object Model (DOM) as an API to the document for developers. The DOM gave developers a tree-based representation of the HTML tags of a document and also access to cookies to retrieve the state of the document. As time went on, the DOM went from a largely read-only structure to a read-write structure where updating the DOM would lead to re-rendering of the document.</p>

<p>Once documents gained the ability to execute code, browsers needed to define the execution context for JavaScript programs. The policy that was developed is called the Same-Origin policy and is still one of the fundamental security primitives of browser security. Originally, the Same-Origin policy stated that JavaScript within one document can only access its own DOM and the DOMs of other documents with the same origin. Later when <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (and now <code>Fetch</code>) were added, a modified version of the same origin policy followed. These APIs could issue requests to any origin, they could only read the response to requests from the same origin.</p>

<p>What exactly is an origin? It’s the tuple of protocol, hostname, and port of a document.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">https://www.example.com:443/app
^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
Scheme  Host            Port</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 1: Scheme, host, and port of this url is the tuple that composes a browser origin.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/same-origin.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Same Origin Diagram"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: An illustration of the Same-Origin in action. JavaScript running on www.evil.com is unable to access the DOM of www.example.com.</em></p>

<p>The Same-Origin policy has been great in mitigating attacks on static sites as illustrated in Figure (2). However, attacks on dynamically generated sites that accept user input have been quite difficult because the web allows mixing of code and data. Mixing code and data allows attacker-controlled input to execute within the origin of the document.</p>

<p>XSS attacks typically manifest themselves in three broad manners: reflected, stored, and DOM-based.</p>

<p>Reflected and stored XSS attacks are fundamentally the same, as they both rely on malicious input being sent to the backend server and the server (at some point) presenting that input to the user. Reflected XSS occurs immediately, usually in the form of a maliciously crafted link by the attacker that the victim then clicks. Stored XSS occurs when the attacker uploads malicious input that is later displayed to the user. DOM-based attacks are different in that they occur purely client-side and involve malicious input manipulating the DOM.</p>

<p>If you didn’t fully grasp the forms above, don’t worry, they’ll make more sense as we cover some examples below.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="reflected-xss-attacks">Reflected XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Below you can see a simple Go-based web application that “reflects” its input (even if it’s a malicious script) back to the user. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss1.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss1.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)

    <span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>URL</span>.<span>Query</span>()[<span>"message"</span>]
    <span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
       <span>messages</span> = []<span>string</span>{<span>"hello, world"</span>}
    }
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;%v&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 3: An example of a web application with a reflected XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack navigate to the vulnerable URL below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">http://localhost:8080?message<span>=</span>&lt;script&gt;alert<span>(</span>1<span>)</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Take a look at the source, and you’ll see the server returned a document that looks something like the one in Figure (4). Note how the mixing of code and data allowed this attack to occur.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<span>alert</span>(<span>1</span>)&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 4: Example output of a web application vulnerable to XSS.</em></p>

<p>Admittedly, this may seem like a somewhat contrived example because XSS protection was explicitly disabled. However this form of XSS protection has always been heuristic-based with a variety of workarounds for different browsers. It was disabled to create simple cross-browser examples that illustrate the core concepts of XSS attacks. Furthermore, some browsers are removing these heuristic-based XSS protections, for <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704">example if you are running Chrome 78 or above</a>, you don’t need to include the <code>w.Header().Set("X-XSS-Protection", "0")</code> line for this attack to work.</p>

<h3 id="stored-xss-attacks">Stored XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Stored XSS attacks are fundamentally similar to reflected attacks, the main difference being the attack payload comes from a datastore instead of directly from the input. For example, an attacker will upload the payload to the web application which will then be shown to every logged in user.</p>

<p>Below is a simple chat application written in Go that illustrates a stored XSS attack. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss2.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss2.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"log"</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>

)

<span>var</span> <span>mu</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>Mutex</span>

<span>var</span> <span>tmpl</span> = <span>`
</span><span>&lt;form action="/save"&gt;
</span><span>  Message: &lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</span><span>  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/form&gt;
</span><span>%v
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>saveHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>mu</span>.<span>Lock</span>()
	<span>defer</span> <span>mu</span>.<span>Unlock</span>()

	<span>r</span>.<span>ParseForm</span>()
	<span>messages</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span>.<span>Form</span>[<span>"message"</span>]
	<span>if</span> !<span>ok</span> {
		<span>http</span>.<span>Error</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>"missing message"</span>, <span>500</span>)
	}

	<span>db</span> = append(<span>db</span>, <span>messages</span>[<span>0</span>])

	<span>http</span>.<span>Redirect</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>r</span>, <span>"/"</span>, <span>301</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>viewHandler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
	<span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"Content-Type"</span>, <span>"text/html; charset=utf-8"</span>)

	<span>var</span> <span>sb</span> <span>strings</span>.<span>Builder</span>
	<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;ul&gt;"</span>)
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>message</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>db</span> {
		<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;li&gt;"</span> <span>+</span> <span>message</span> <span>+</span> <span>"&lt;/li&gt;"</span>)
	}
	<span>sb</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"&lt;/ul&gt;"</span>)

	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>tmpl</span>, <span>sb</span>.<span>String</span>())
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>viewHandler</span>)
	<span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/save"</span>, <span>saveHandler</span>)
	<span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 5: An example of a web application with a stored XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and type in the message <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The attack occurs in two phases. First, the attack payload is saved to the datastore in the <code>storeHandler</code> function. Next, when the page is rendered in <code>viewHandler</code>, the attack payload is directly added to the output.</p>

<p>Once again, the culprit is the allowing of mixing of data and code. The browser has no way to tell if the payload was intentional or malicious.</p>

<h3 id="dom-based-xss-attacks">DOM-Based XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>DOM-based XSS attacks don’t involve the backend and occur purely client-side. They’re also quite interesting because modern web applications are moving logic to the client. DOM- based XSS attacks occur when user input is allowed to directly manipulate the DOM in unsafe ways. The good news for attackers is that the DOM has a wide variety of ways it can be abused, the most popular being <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>document.write</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a web application that serves static content. It’s fundamentally the same as the reflected XSS example, but here the attack will occur entirely client- side. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss3.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss3.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>const</span> <span>content</span> = <span>`
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;html&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;head&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;script&gt;
</span><span>          window.onload = function() {
</span><span>             var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
</span><span>             p = document.getElementById("content")
</span><span>             p.innerHTML = params.get("message")
</span><span>	     };
</span><span>       &lt;/script&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/head&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;body&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;p id="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/body&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/html&gt;
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {
    <span>w</span>.<span>Header</span>().<span>Set</span>(<span>"X-XSS-Protection"</span>, <span>"0"</span>)
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Fprintf</span>(<span>w</span>, <span>content</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>http</span>.<span>HandleFunc</span>(<span>"/"</span>, <span>handler</span>)
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 6: An example of a web application with a DOM-based XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see this attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1);/&gt;"</code>. Note that the attack vector is slightly different, and the XSS sink <code>innerHTML</code> won’t execute a script directly; however, it will add HTML elements which will then execute JavaScript. In the example given, an image element is added that executes JavaScript when an error occurs. The error always occurs because the attacker conveniently always provides an invalid source.</p>

<p>If you want to directly add a script element, you’ll have to use a different XSS sink. As we mentioned, you’re in luck because the DOM provides a wide variety of dangerous sinks. Replace the script element in Figure (6) with the script element in Figure (7) and navigate to the following URL <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;"</code>. This attack works because <code>document.write</code> accepts script elements directly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
   <span>window</span>.<span>onload</span> = <span>function</span>() {
      <span>var</span> <span>params</span> = <span>new</span> <span>URLSearchParams</span>(<span>window</span>.<span>location</span>.<span>search</span>);
      <span>document</span>.<span>open</span>();
      <span>document</span>.<span>write</span>(<span>params</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"message"</span>));
      <span>document</span>.close();
   };
&lt;<span>/</span><span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-beast-that-is-google">The beast that is Google</h2>
<p>There was a time when Google was a small, quirky company with a single product so awesome that it blew away the competition. That time is long gone.</p>

<p>These days Google is a gigantic multinational mega-corp. But that’s understating it a little. Think of Google as a kind of Godzilla that slurps up data about its users at one end and craps out gold ingots at the other. It does both of these at huge scale.</p>

<p>When thinking about Google, there are three things that are not easy to grasp but which are immensely important:</p>

  <li>Google is not a search engine, it is not simply a maker of productivity tools. Google is a giant advertising platform.</li>
  <li>Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform. The gold ingots are coming out at an alarming rate and being used for all kinds of other things.</li>
  <li>Google’s success, the fact that it is so good at what it does, the fact that it is crapping out a mountain of gold ingots, is terrible for us and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a quick tour of these points before getting onto Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-not-a-search-engine">Google is not a search engine</h2>
<p>Google is an advertising platform. Everything it does, all of its products, are geared towards selling advertising. Most of its products are free, many of them are useful, and a few are even great. But they all exist to suck up more data so that it can become even better at selling advertising.</p>

<p>The way Google turns data into gold ingots is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Google collects as much data about you as it can.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Google uses this data to get to know you very very well: what you like, what you don’t like, whether you are pregnant, whether you are gay, where your friends live, where you spend your time, what you purchase online.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Google uses its extensive knowledge of you to show you advertising that fits you like a tailor-made suit.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Lots of gold ingots.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> and it’s certainly not about giving you a great user experience, it’s about making money.</p>

<p>To give just one perfect example of the point I’m making: look at the way that paid search results (i.e. adverts) have become ever harder to identify in Google’s search results.</p>

<p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-evolution.jpg" alt="'Google Ads timeline'"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332">Google Ads Timeline compiled by Search Engine Land</a></em></p>

<p>This is not the evolution you expect to see for a company that loves its users. This is what you expect from a mega-corp that wants ever more profits.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-spectacularly-awesomely-frighteningly-successful-as-an-advertising-platform">Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform</h2>
<p>Many of Google’s products have an absolutely staggering market share. Google has nine products with more than one billion users each. Google Chrome is the most popular web browser with a market share of 64%. Google’s Android is the most popular operating system on mobile devices with a market share of 72%. Google’s products are being used by most internet connected humans on earth.</p>

<p>Combine this with the fact that Google has a monopoly on online advertising. Ok, actually that’s not true. It has a duopoly along  with Facebook. Facebook is guilty of most of the things I mention in this post, and is probably worse, but I’m saving my venom for Facebook for another day.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that Google’s revenue is eye-wateringly massive: around 180 billion USD in 2020, which is around the GDP of New Zealand. Now consider that only four years ago, Google’s revenue was 90 billion USD, which means that the revenue doubled in 4 years. Wow!</p>

<p>This mountain of gold ingots used to flow to newspapers and magazines – but no more. The result has been the decimation of local news and the magazine industry. It is true that  news organizations have been terrible at innovation in the past three decades and now they have been steam-rollered as a result. Why is this bad? Read on.</p>

<h2 id="googles-success-is-not-good-for-us-as-a-society">Google’s success is not good for us as a society</h2>

<p>Google’s success is good for Google and its shareholders. It’s not good for us, the consumers. We live in a world where local news is either stone dead or barely surviving. As we have learned in the past few years, a functioning media is essential to democracy.</p>

<p>So has the market done its magic and filled the gap? Has the creation part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a> happened? Do we now have a better and superior solution for local news?</p>

<p>Nope. Online news articles are a hideous cluster-fuck of click-baiting headlines, cookie banners, privacy nightmares and top heavy with advertising and it’s mostly Google’s fault. Producers of news are desperately wringing every last pathetic drop of profit from their content.</p>

<p>Do you know why online recipes now begin with the author’s life story and are an interminable bore until you reach the actual beef? It’s because of Google. It’s because even writers of online recipes are prostrating themselves before the omnipotent online God that is Google.</p>

<p>And that huge growing pile of gold ingots? That’s in itself a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For many years, the astonishing torrent of money thrown off by Google’s Web-search monopoly has fueled invasions of multiple other segments, enabling Google to bat aside rivals who might have brought better experiences to billions of lives.</p>

  <p>Google Apps and Google Maps are both huge presences in the tech economy. Are they paying for themselves, or are they using search advertising revenue as rocket fuel? Nobody outside Google knows.”  – <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google">Break up Google</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many other nuanced and large problems created by Google’s size and profitability and I’ve only scratched the surface here.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-google-analytics">So what about Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google is harvesting data across all of its products, so why pick on Google Analytics? Because for most of the products, if you choose to use them, it’s your data that is harvested. It’s different for Analytics. You as a web developer are making a choice that affects all of your users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Analytics is the most popular website stats tool. More than 53% of all sites on the web track their visitors using Google Analytics. 84% of sites that do use a known analytics script use Google Analytics. It’s the most popular third-party request on the web. It accounts for 0.64% of all network requests.” – <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">Plausible.io blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first began to develop websites, it was a no-brainer to add Google Analytics to anything I created.: “It’s free! It’s good! It’s what everyone uses!”</p>

<p>Actually it’s not that good really:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed</li>
  <li>It’s overkill for the majority of site owners</li>
  <li>It’s a privacy liability and requires an extensive privacy policy</li>
  <li>It worsens the user experience due to the necessity of annoying prompts.</li>
  <li>It’s blocked by many browsers (e.g. Firefox) so the data is not very accurate.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more reasons. You can read the full list <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">here</a>.</p>

<p>Has Google ever revealed what it does with data from Analytics internally? Nope. But we don’t even need to speculate. It seems pretty obvious to me that they’re using it to guzzle up even more data and to crap out ever more gold ingots.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-google-analytics">Alternatives to Google Analytics</h2>
<p>So are there alternatives? Sure, there’s a bunch and some cost money. I think it’s money worth spending.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-analytics">Here is a comprehensive and curated list</a> of analytics tools, including privacy focussed analytics.</p>

<p>I use Fathom Analytics for this blog and am switching all of my products to it. To see the analytics for this blog <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/folzoonq/casparwre.de">click here</a> (note that is an affiliate link – I will earn some money if you signup, you will get 10 USD off).</p>

<p>I believe it is a moral imperative for web developers to think about the “free” tools they are using to provide their products. In the case of Google Analytics, the tool is only very superficially free. We are all paying the hidden costs.</p>

  <article>
    <header>
      
      <p id="date">
        <time>Sep 01, 2020</time>
      </p>
    </header>
    <p>If you haven't noticed already I really love plain text so I thought I would find some plain text protocols that are used in different software systems. The Redis Protocol specification states it best by describing its own protocol, but this applies to all of the plain text protocols I will cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement.</li>
<li>Fast to parse.</li>
<li>Human readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time you are building a software system and have to exchange data start with using a simple plain text protocol and then add in the complexity for optimization later. All of these protocols can be sent as plain text data over a TCP or UDP. They are easily inspected, small, and direct.</p>

<p>Starting off with the simplest one in the list is the Graphite plaintext protocol for delivering metrics into Graphite via Carbon.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;metics_path&gt; &lt;metics_value&gt; &lt;metrics_timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>/cpu_load/core_0 0.08 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_1 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_2 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_3 0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The next simplest one in the list is the Influx Line Protocol. While this is similar to Graphite it does add some additional metadata to its specification.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;measurement&gt;[,&lt;tag_set&gt;...] &lt;field_set&gt;... &lt;timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>cpu,core=0 load=0.08 1599009388
cpu,core=1 load=0.07 1599009388
cpu,core=2 load=0.07 1599009388
cpu,core=3 load=0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Here is where things get more complex, but the same 3 characteristics from above apply still. Simplifying the protocol for the sake of brevity in this article we see that the protocol is a single line of text and the initial command dictates what argument data types are allowed after it.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND arguments...
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>GET key1
SET key2 100
HSET hash key1 value1
HGETALL hash
</code></pre><p>There is more to this particular protocol to denote strings, numbers, arrays, etc in a text format which is outlined in the official specification.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Yes, HTTP is just plain text. Since the protocol itself has lots of permutations of metadata lets just look at some examples of an HTTP request and response.</p>
<p>The request example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /articles/plain-text-protocols/ HTTP/1.1
Host: blainsmith.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
</code></pre><p>The response example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 6262
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:41:35 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:37:33 GMT

&lt;THE HTML OF THIS ARTICLE&gt;
</code></pre><p>Your browser constructs the request when you visit <a href="http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/">http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/</a> and parses the response when it comes back from the server. There are a lot more allowable headers, but the basics of this protocol are pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The world runs on these types of plain text protocol so don't reinvent the wheel if you find yourself building a software system and there is an existing protocol available. If there is an existing plain text protocol that you can adapt to your purposes then do that since there might be a library available already to serialize and deserialize the protocol so you don't have to write your own. If any of these protocols do not fit your needs and you need to write your own then keep it simple. If everyone's web browsers are using HTTP which has worked for decades there is no reason for you to create a complicated protocol unless your can prove the need to otherwise.</p>

February 25, 2021 | https://www.treasuryprime.com/blog/developer-sandbox | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.treasuryprime.com/blog/developer-sandbox">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A safe space to experiment and bring your fintech innovations to life.</p><div><p>Today, we are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime Developer Sandbox</a>, a space that allows developers to begin using Treasury Prime’s advanced banking services, all in the safety of an enclosed environment, without requiring a connection to a production bank account. And it's free to use, allows immediate access, and is available now. With the launch of the Developer Sandbox, developers can build in a consequence-free environment. When you don’t have to worry about a typo causing a million dollar error, you're set free to experiment, and experimentation leads to innovation.</p><p>Treasury Prime began with a mission to make banking technology more accessible, while providing enough guide rails to keep things safe and secure. We wanted to design an elegant, powerful API that lets developers do what they do best: change the world by creating innovative software solutions. At the same time–having collectively spent decades working in the banking industry–our team knows the substantial value that banks provide. As such, we also strive to empower banks to do what they do best: risk management, security at scale, and providing knowledgeable customer support. So, by helping to match the fintechs inventing the future with the forward-looking banks who are here to support them, Treasury Prime aims to enable a new generation of financial innovation.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>The Developer Sandbox allows you to test all of the Treasury Prime APIs (with a few minor exceptions), so you can build a proof of concept quickly and get to market fast. There is no cost for using this environment, so you are free to build and test as long as you like without worrying about fees or contracts. And when you’re ready to make the jump to production, you just need to swap out your environment URLs and generate some production API keys. You’ll also need to get connected with a bank, which is why we’ve partnered with a growing number of banks to make sure we can help connect almost any fintech with a banking partner.<br></p><p>The Treasury Prime APIs were designed around the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>, and all response bodies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> encoded, so they should feel familiar to almost anyone who’s worked with APIs before, and be easy to understand for those who are new to the game. So what exactly can you do with Treasury Prime's APIs?</p><ul role="list"><li>Apply to open new bank accounts</li><li>Issue branded debit cards</li><li>Make deposits with remote deposit capture</li><li>Make payments and card transactions&nbsp;</li><li>Fund accounts</li></ul><p>And that’s just to name a few… So, now that you know a bit more about what <em>we</em> do, let's take a look at how <em>you</em> can build the next big fintech innovation!</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>In the examples below, we’ll look at how you can transfer funds between two accounts at the same bank using a book transfer, then follow that up by checking the available balance on an account.<br></p><p>If you’d like to follow along, you can <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Developer Sandbox account</a> (it’s fast and painless I promise). Once you’ve signed up, you can then log into the Developer Sandbox, and generate a set of API Keys which will be used to authenticate your requests. In our examples these keys are shown as <em>$API_KEY_ID </em>and <em>$API_SECRET_KEY.</em>&nbsp;You'll need to swap these out with Key ID&nbsp;and Secret&nbsp;Key you generate in your sandbox when making requests.<br></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you’d like more in-depth information on any of our APIs, please see our </em><a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs" target="_blank"><em>API Reference Documentation</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Book Transfer</h4><p>A book transfer is an electronic funds transfer between two accounts at the same bank. In this example we’ll look at how you can transfer funds from a checking account to a savings account.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>A checking and savings account are automatically created in your Developer Sandbox for testing purposes.</em><br></p><p>The first step in creating a book transfer is to obtain the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between. To accomplish this, make a GET request to the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">account</a> endpoint.</p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/account
</code></pre></div><p>This will return a list of <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">Account</a> objects. In order to make a book transfer, you will need the account ID for both the sending and receiving accounts, which are stored in the<em> '</em>id' property of each account object.</p><div><pre><code>{

}
</code></pre></div><p>After obtaining the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between, you have all the necessary information required to issue a book transfer. To accomplish this, make a POST request to the <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">book</a> endpoint, passing the 'amount' of the transfer, as well as the 'from_account_id' and the 'to_account_id' (representing the funding account and receiving account respectively).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You will need to replace the 'from_account_id' and 'to_account_id' values with those from your own account.</em></p><div><pre><code>curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_SECRET_KEY https://api.treasuryprime.com/book \\

</code></pre></div><p>A successful response will return a <a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs#book" target="_blank">Book Transfer</a> object. Note that the status of this request is currently set to "pending". You can register <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#webhooks" target="_blank">webhooks</a> to notify you when the transfer is complete, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this example.<br></p><div><pre><code>{

			<p><span>S</span>uppose aliens existed, and imagine that some of them had been watching our planet for its entire four and a half billion years. What would they have seen? Over most of that vast timespan, Earth’s appearance altered slowly and gradually. Continents drifted; ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved, with many of them becoming extinct.</p><p>But in just a tiny sliver of Earth’s history—the last hundred centuries—the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture—and later urbanization. The changes accelerated as the human population increased.</p><p>Then came even faster changes. Within just a century, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to rise dangerously fast. Radio emissions that couldn’t be explained by natural processes appeared and something else unprecedented happened: Rockets launched from the planet’s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some spacecraft were propelled into orbits around the Earth; others journeyed to the moon, Mars, Jupiter, and even Pluto.</p><p>If those hypothetical aliens continued to keep watch, what would they witness in the next century? Will a final spasm of activity be followed by silence due to climate change? Or will the planet’s ecology stabilize? Will there be massive terraforming? Will an armada of spacecraft launched from Earth spawn new oases of life elsewhere?</p><figure data-alt="Livio_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18198_9769c201b88f46a83dabfc1b9f97a033.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>LASER POWER:</strong> A crucial impediment to space flight is the inefficiency of chemical fuel. One day a laser power station, located on Earth, might generate a beam to “push” a craft through space.</span><span>NASA / Pat Rawlings (SAIC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s think specifically about the future of space exploration. Successful missions such as Viking, Cassini, New Horizons, Juno, and Rosetta were all done with last-century technology. We can realistically expect that during this century, the entire solar system—planets, moons, and asteroids—will be explored by flotillas of robotic craft.<br></p><p>Will there still be a role for humans in crewed spacecraft?</p><p>There’s no denying that NASA’s new Perseverance rover speeding across the Jezero crater on Mars may miss some startling discoveries that no human geologist could reasonably overlook. But machine learning is advancing fast, as is sensor technology. In contrast, the cost gap between crewed and autonomous missions remains huge.</p><p>We believe the future of crewed spaceflight lies with privately funded adventurers like SpaceX and Blue Origin, prepared to participate in a cut-price program far riskier than western nations could impose on publicly supported projects. These ventures—bringing a Silicon-Valley-type culture into a domain long-dominated by NASA and a few aerospace conglomerates—have innovated and improved rocketry far faster than NASA or the European Space Agency have done. The future role of the national agencies will be attenuated—becoming more akin to an airport rather than to an airline.</p><blockquote><p>We are near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is just beginning.</p> </blockquote><p>We would argue that inspirationally led private companies should front all missions involving humans as cut-price high-risk ventures. There would still be many volunteers—a few perhaps even accepting one-way tickets—driven by the same motives as early explorers and mountaineers. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. If that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be sold as dangerous, extreme sports, or intrepid exploration.<br></p><p>The most crucial impediment to space flight stems from the intrinsic inefficiency of chemical fuel, and the requirement to carry a weight of fuel far exceeding that of the payload. So long as we are dependent on chemical fuels, interplanetary travel will remain a challenge. Nuclear power could be transformative. Allowing much higher in-course speeds would drastically cut the transit times in the solar system, reducing not only astronauts’ boredom, but their exposure to damaging radiation. It’s more efficient if the fuel supply can be on the ground; for instance, propelling spacecraft into orbit via a “space elevator”—and then using a “star-shot”-type laser beam generated on Earth to push on a “sail” attached to the spacecraft.</p><p>By 2100, thrill seekers in the mold of Felix Baumgartner (the Austrian skydiver who in 2012 broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon) may have established bases on Mars, or maybe even on asteroids. Elon Musk has said he wants to die on Mars—“but not on impact.” It’s a realistic goal, and an alluring one to some.</p><p>But don’t expect mass emigration from Earth. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth’s problems. We’ve got to solve those here. Coping with climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic may seem daunting, but it’s a piece of cake compared to terraforming Mars. There’s no place in our solar system that offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Mount Everest. Simply put, there’s no Planet B for ordinary risk-averse people.</p><p>Still, we (and our progeny here on Earth) should cheer on the brave space adventurers. They have a pivotal role to play in spearheading the post-human future and determining what happens in the 22nd century and beyond.</p><p><span>P</span>ioneer explorers will be ill-adapted to their new habitat, so they will have a compelling incentive to re-design themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. This might be the first step toward divergence into a new species.</p><p>Organic creatures need a planetary surface environment on which life could emerge and evolve. But if post-humans make the transition to fully inorganic intelligence, they won’t need an atmosphere. They may even prefer zero-gravity, especially for constructing massive artifacts. It’s in deep space that non-biological brains may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine.</p><p>There are chemical and metabolic limits to the size and processing power of organic brains. Maybe we are close to these limits already. But no such limits apply to or constrain electronic computers (still less, perhaps, quantum computers). So, by any definition of “thinking,” the amount and intensity that can be achieved by organic human-type brains will be swamped by the cerebrations of AI.</p><p>We are perhaps near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is only just beginning. It may happen fastest away from Earth—we wouldn’t expect (and certainly wouldn’t wish for) such rapid changes in humanity here on the Earth, though our survival may depend on ensuring the AI on Earth remains “benevolent.”</p><figure data-alt=" Livio_BREAKER-3"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18200_33ec1f50197cc4f74b3e8dc359ec3280.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SPACE TOURISM:</strong> Private space companies should avoid the phrase “space tourism,” write Martin Ress and Mario Livio. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. They’re more like extreme sports.</span><span>NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span></figcaption></figure><p>Few doubt machines will gradually surpass or enhance more and more of our distinctively human capabilities. Disagreements are only about the timescale on which this will happen. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil says it will be just a matter of a few decades. More cautious scientists envisage centuries. Either way, the timescales for technological advances are an instant compared to the timescales of the Darwinian evolution that led to humanity’s emergence—and more relevantly, less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time ahead. The products of future technological evolution could surpass humans by as much as we have surpassed slime mold.<br></p><p>But, you may wonder, what about consciousness?</p><p>Philosophers and computer scientists debate whether consciousness is something that characterizes only the type of wet, organic brains possessed by humans, apes, and dogs. Would electronic intelligences, even if their intellects would seem superhuman, lack self-awareness? The ability to imagine things that do not exist? An inner life? Or is consciousness an emergent property that any sufficiently complex network will eventually possess? Some say it’s irrelevant and semantic, like asking whether submarines can swim.</p><blockquote><p>Extraterrestrial civilization might consist of a swarm of microscopic probes that could have evaded notice.</p> </blockquote><p>We don’t think it is. If the machines are what computer scientists refer to as “zombies,” we would not accord their experiences the same value as ours, and the post-human future would seem rather bleak. On the other hand, if they are conscious, we should welcome the prospect of their future hegemony.<br></p><p>What will their guiding motivation be if they become fully autonomous entities? We have to admit we have absolutely no idea. Think of the variety of bizarre motives (ideological, financial, political, egotistical, and religious) that have driven human endeavors in the past. Here’s one simple example of how different they could be from our naive expectations: They could be contemplative. Even less obtrusively, they may realize it’s easier to think at low temperatures, therefore getting far away from any star, or even hibernating for billions of years until the cosmic microwave background cooled down far below its current 3 degrees Kelvin. At the other edge of the spectrum, they could be expansionist, which seems to be the expectation of most who’ve thought about the future trajectory of civilizations.</p><p>Even if life had originated only on Earth, it need not remain a marginal, trivial feature of the cosmos. Humans could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever-more complex intelligence spreads through the galaxy, transcending our limitations. The “sphere of influence” (or some would envisage a “frontier of conquest”) could encompass the entire galaxy, spreading via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA or instructions for 3-D printers. The leap to neighboring stars is just an early step …</p></div></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

<p>Capabilities are being used by many Linux-based software nowadays to limit what a process can do. But I think the documentation is a bit hard to grasp and I found some parts of capabilities implementation confusing so I decided to condense my current knowledge into a shorter article.</p>



<p>The most important reference for capabilities is up-to-date man page <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>. But that doesn’t provide an easy to read introduction.</p>



<h3>Process Capabilities</h3>



<p>Permissions of regular users are very limited, while permissions of “root” user are very powerful. But processes running under “root” often don’t require full root capabilities. </p>



<p>To help reduce “root” user power, POSIX capabilities provides a way to restrict groups of privileged system operations a process and its children are allowed to do. They basically divide full “root” privilege into a set of distinct privileges. The idea of capabilities was described in POSIX 1003.1e draft that was withdrawn in 1997.</p>



<p>Each Linux process (task) has <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L134">five 64-bit numbers</a> (sets) holding capability bits (used to be 32-bit before Linux 2.6.25) which can be inspected by reading  /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</p>



<pre>CapInh: 00000000000004c0<br>CapPrm: 00000000000004c0<br>CapEff: 00000000000004c0<br>CapBnd: 00000000000004c0<br>CapAmb: 0000000000000000</pre>



<p>These numbers (here displayed as hex digits) are acting as a bitmap encoding a set of capabilities. Full names are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inheritable</strong> – capabilities that children can inherit</li><li><strong>Permitted</strong> – capabilities the task is permitted to use</li><li><strong>Effective</strong> – capabilities actually effective</li><li><strong>Bounding</strong> set –  prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared by all threads, probably meant to describe a set beyond which capabilities cannot grow. Currently it is per-task set. It is a part of execve transformation logic (more later) and also limits what a process can set to its inheritable set using capset().</li><li><strong>Ambient</strong> set (since Linux 4.3) – added to give capabilities to non-0 user easily, without using setuid or file capabilities (more later).</li></ul>



<p>If a task asks to perform a privileged operation (like binding on ports &lt; 1024), the kernel checks Effective bounding set to see if <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/capability.h#L183">CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</a> is set. If it is, it continues. Otherwise, it rejects the operation with EPERM (operation not permitted). These CAP_ defines in the kernel source are numbered sequentially so CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE being 10 means a bit 1&lt;&lt;10 = 0x400 (that is the ‘4’ hex digit in my previous example). </p>



<p>The full human readable list of currently-defined capabilities can be found in your up-to-date manpage <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> (the one here is for reference only).</p>



<p>Additionally there is a library libcap to make capabilities management and inspection easier. In addition to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libcap.3.html">library API</a>, the package includes <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/capsh.1.html">capsh</a> utility which, among other things, allows printing its capabilities. <br></p>



<pre># capsh --print
Current: = cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
Bounding set =cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service
Ambient set =
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-ambient-raise: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
</pre>



<p>There are a few <strong>confusing</strong> bits:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Current</strong> – displays effective, inheritable and permitted capabilities of capsh process in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_to_text.3.html"><strong>cap_to_text(3)</strong></a><strong> format</strong>. Again, it displays it in cap_to_text format which lists capabilities basically as capability[,capability…]+(e|i|p) groups, where ‘e’ means effective, ‘i’ inheritable and ‘p’ permitted. The list is not separated by ‘,’ as you would guess (cap_setgid+eip,cap_setuid+eip). The ‘,’ separates capabilities in a single +… (action) group. The actual list of action groups is then separated by spaces. So another example with two action groups would be “= cap_sys_chroot+ep cap_net_bind_service+eip”. And also these two action groups “= cap_net_bind_service+e cap_net_bind_service+ip” would encode the same meaning as  a single “cap_net_bind_service+eip”.</li><li><strong>Bounding set/Ambient set</strong>. To make things even more confusing, these two lines contain just a list of capabilities set in those sets, separated by spaces. No cap_to_text format is used here because it is not listing permitted, effective, inheritable sets together but just a single (bounding/ambient) set.</li><li><strong>Securebits</strong>: displays task’s <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L133">securebits</a> integer in as decimal/hex/fancy-verilog-convention-for-binary-strings (yes, everyone would expect it here and it’s totally clear by ‘b because every sysadmin programs its own FPGAs and ASICs). The state of securebits follows. The actual bits are defined as SECBIT_* in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/securebits.h#L22">securebits.h</a> and also described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.</li><li>The tool lacks the one important state and that is the “<strong>NoNewPrivs</strong>” which can be also seen by inspecting /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status. That is described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> only, even though it directly affects capabilities when used in conjunction with file capabilities (more later). NoNewPrivs is described as “<em>With no_new_privs set to 1, execve(2) promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-functional). Once set, this the no_new_privs attribute cannot be unset.  The setting of this attribute is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).</em>“. This is the flag which Kubernetes sets to 1 when allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false in pod’s securityContext. </li></ul>



<p>When a process starts a new process by doing execve(2), capabilities are transformed to the child using the formula mentioned in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>:</p>



<pre>P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |
                  (F(permitted) &amp; P(bounding)) | P'(ambient)

P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

P'(bounding)    = P(bounding)       [i.e., unchanged]

where:

     P()   denotes the value of a thread capability set before the
           execve(2)

     P'()  denotes the value of a thread capability set after the
           execve(2)

     F()   denotes a file capability set
</pre>



<p>These rules describe action taken for every bit in ambient/permitted/effective/inheritable/bounding sets. It uses standard C syntax (&amp; for logic AND, | for logic OR). P’ is the child process, P is the current process calling execve(2). F are so called “file capabilities” of the file being execve’d.</p>



<p>Additionaly, a process can programmatically change its inheritable, permitted and effective sets using libpcap any  time according to these rules:</p>



<ul><li>Unless the caller have the CAP_SETPCAP, the new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(permitted)</em></li><li>(since Linux 2.6.25) The new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(bounding)</em></li><li>The new <strong>permitted</strong> set must be a subset of P(permitted) </li><li>The new <strong>effective</strong> set must be a subset of P(effective)</li></ul>



<p>As HN user eqvinox suggested, pspax from <a href="https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils">pax-utils</a> can be used to list capabilities of running processes, just compile it with libpcap support (make USE_CAP=yes):</p>
<pre>  # pspax
  USER     PID    PAX    MAPS ETYPE      NAME             CAPS ATTR  
  root     60879  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     crond            =ep  system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0  
  root     60910  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     ntpd             cap_net_bind_service,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_time=ep system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0
</pre>



<h3>File capabilities</h3>



<p>Sometimes a user with a reduced set of capabilities needs to run a binary which requires more capabilities. Previously, this was achieved by setuid binary (chmod +s ./executable). Such a binary, if owned by root, would assign full root privileges to it when executed by any user.</p>



<p>That gives too many privileges to the binary, so POSIX capabilities implemented a concept called “file capabilities”. They are stored as a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html">extended file attribute</a> called “security.capability” so you need a capable filesystem (ext*, XFS, Raiserfs, Brtfs, overlay2, …). For a process to write to this attribute, CAP_SETFCAP capability is needed (be in process’ effective set).<br></p>



<pre>$ getfattr -m - -d `which ping`
# file: usr/bin/ping
security.capability=0sAQAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

$ getcap `which ping`  
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>



<h3>Special cases and notes</h3>



<p>Of course, life is not simple, so is not the implementation of capabilities and there are several special cases described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> man page. Probably the most important are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>setuid file bit and file capabilities are ignored if NoNewPrivs is set</strong> or filesystem is mounted nosuid or the process calling execve is being ptraced. The file capabilities are also ignored when the kernel is booted with<em> </em>no_file_caps.</li><li><strong>Capability-dumb</strong> binary is a binary converted from setuid to file capabilities without changing its code. Such binaries are often converted by setting +ep capability on them like “setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep ./binary”. The important part is “e”, effective. Upon execve, this capability is added to both permitted and effective so the executable is ready to use the privileged operation. In contrast <strong>capability-smart</strong> binary which uses libpcap or similar, can use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a> (or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/capget.2.html">capset</a>) to set “effective” or “inheritable” bits at any point, as long as that capability is already in the “permitted” set. So “setcap cap_net_bind_service+p ./binary” would be enough for a capability-smart binary as it will be able to set the effective bit itself before calling the privileged operation.  See my <a href="https://gist.github.com/k3a/a38f4439f85eda4f77eda19c4ae8c80c">example code</a>.</li><li><strong>setuid-root binaries</strong> continue to work, giving all privileges of root when run by a non-root user. Unless they have file capabilities set, in which case only those are granted. It is also possible to create a setuid binary with empty file capability set, making it execute as 0, though without any capabilities. …</li></ul></div></div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/blog.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/sbcl.html">sbcl</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a> </p> <p> Written on 2021-02-24 21:50:00 </p> <p>It's taken me much longer than I hoped, but I finally have a second version of
my patches to build static executables tested and ready to go! This set of
patches vastly improves upon the first by reducing the amount of compilation
needed at the cost of sacrificing a little purity. Additionally I have created
a system that automates the process of building a static executable, along with
other release related tasks.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new patch set can be found on
  the
  <a href="https://github.com/daewok/sbcl/tree/static-executable-v2">static-executable-v2 branch</a> of
  my SBCL fork or at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch</code>
  with a detached signature available at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch.asc</code>
  signed with GPG
  key <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/static/keys/9ACF6934.pub">0x9ACF6934</a>.</li>
<li>You'll definitely want to build SBCL with the <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code>
  feature (newly added by the patch). You'll probably also want the
  <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature (already exists, but the patch also enables it
  on arm/arm64).</li>
<li>The new patch lets you build a static executable with less compilation of
  Lisp code.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>
  automates the process of building a static executable by tying it into ASDF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>If you need a refresher about what static executables are or what use cases
they're good for, see
my <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/posts/static-executables-with-sbcl.html">previous post on this topic</a>.</p>

<p>With my previous patch, the only way you could create a static executable was
to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the foreign symbols needed by your code. The easiest way to do
   this is to compile all your Lisp code and then dump the information from the
   image.</li>
<li>From that list of foreign symbols, create a C file that contains fills an
   array with references to those symbols.</li>
<li>Recompile the SBCL core and runtime with this new file, additionally
   disabling libdl support and linking against your foreign libraries.</li>
<li>(Re)compile all your Lisp code with the new runtime (if you made an image in
   step 1 it will not be compatible with the new runtime due to feature and
   build ID mismatches).</li>
<li>Dump the executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the most general case, this involved compiling your entire Lisp image
twice. After some #lisp discussions, I realized there was a better way of doing
this. While the previous process still works, the new recommended process now
looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the image you would like to make into a static executable and save it.</li>
<li>Dump the foreign symbol info from this image and write the C file that SBCL
   can use to prelink itself.</li>
<li>Compile that C file and link it into an existing sbcl.o file to make a new
   runtime. sbcl.o is the SBCL runtime in object form, created when building
   with the <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature.</li>
<li>Load the image from step 1 into your new runtime. It will be compatible
   because the build ID and feature set are the same!</li>
<li>Dump your now static executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This new process can significantly reduce the amount of time needed to make an
executable. Plus it lets you take more advantage of image based
development. It's fairly trivial to build an image exactly like you want, dump
it, and then pair it with a custom static runtime to make a static executable.</p>

<p>There were two primary challenges that needed to be overcome for this version
of the patch set.</p>

<p>First, the SBCL core had to be made robust to every libdl function
uncondtionally returning an error. Since we want the feature set to remain
constant we can't recompile the runtime with <code>#-os-provides-dlopen</code>. Instead,
we take advantage of the fact that Musl libc lets you link static executables
against libdl, but all those functions are noops. This is the "purity"
sacrifice I alluded to above.</p>

<p>Second, since we are reusing a image, the prelink info table (the generated C
file) needed to order the symbols exactly as the image expects them to be
ordered. The tricky bit here is that some libraries (like <code>cl-plus-ssl</code>) add
symbols to the linkage table that will always be undefined. <code>cl-plus-ssl</code> does
this in order to support a wide range of openssl versions. The previous patch
set unconditionally filtered out undefined symbols, which horribly broke things
in the new approach.</p>

<h2>More Documentation</h2>

<p>As before, after applying the patch you'll find a README.static-executable file
in the root of the repo. You'll also find a Dockerfile and an example of how to
use it in the README.static-executable.</p>

<p>You can also check out the tests and documentation in
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> feature does not work on 32-bit ARM + Musl
  libc &gt;= 1.2. Musl switched to 64-bit time under the hood while still
  mataining compatibility with everything compiled for 32-bit time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is how they maintained backwards compatibility. Every time related
  symbol still exists and implements everything on top of the 32-bit time
  interface. However, if you include the standard header file where the symbol
  is defined <em>or</em> you look up the symbol via <code>dlsym</code> you actually get a pointer
  to the 64-bit time version of the symbol. We can't use <code>dlsym</code> (it doesn't
  work in static executables). And the generated C file doesn't include any
  headers.</p>

<p>This <em>could</em> be fixed if someone is motiviated enough to create/find a
  complete, easy to use map between libc symbols and the headers that define
  them and integrate it into the prelink info generator.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> works on Windows but causes test
  failures. The root issue is that mingw64 has implemented their own
  libm. Their trig functions are fast, but use inaccurate instructions (like
  FSIN) under the hood. When prelinking these inaccurate implementations are
  used instead of the more accurate ones (from msvcrt.dll ?) found when using
  <code>dlsym</code> to look up the symbol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I would love to get feedback on this approach and any ideas on how to
   improve it! Please drop me a line (etimmons on Freenode or daewok on
   Github/Gitlab) if you have suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>I've already incorporated static executables
   into <a href="https://www.clpm.dev/">CLPM</a> and will be distributing them starting
   with v0.4.0! I'm going to continue rolling out static executables in my
   other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Pieces of the patch set are now solid enough that I think they can be
   submitted for upstream consideration. I'll start sending them after the
   current 2.1.2 freeze.</p></li>
</ol>

Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear.

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<p><i>To celebrate this announcement, we will be around at this years <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en/exhibitor-list">embedded world digital</a>. You can watch our pitch talk on Wednesday, March 3rd, from 11:10am - 11:20am UTC.
We're available for 1:1 meetings all week.<p>

You can book those through the embedded world web application by searching for "Rust" or "Critical Section" in the exhibitors list.</p></i>
</p>



<p>Ferrocene is an effort led by Ferrous Systems and its newly formed subsidiary Critical Section GmbH to qualify the Rust Language and Compiler for use in the safety-critical domain. This is the third post in a series detailing our plans and actions around this effort, addressing topics discussed in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-pitch/">The Pitch</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-plan/">The Plan</a>. Ferrocene's draft name was "Sealed Rust."</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>improve the status-quo of software quality and correctness in safety-critical domains</strong> by enabling the use of the Rust Programming Language for safety-critical software development. We believe that Rust is a significant improvement over existing tools both from a safety and quality perspective and as an improvement for developer productivity.</p>

<p>You can follow the progress on these efforts on the <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/">Ferrous Systems' Blog</a>, by <a href="https://eepurl.com/guoC6P">subscribing to our newsletter</a>, or by <a href="mailto:ferrocene@critical-section.com">contacting us directly</a>.
Ferrocene is currently looking for partner commitments! Please get in <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">touch via email</a> if interested.</p>

<p>Since our last post in February 2020, we have moved Ferrocene from an idea to an actual project. We strengthened our contacts with interested companies and went deeper into our industrial and language research.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-route-user-research">Finding a route: User Research</h2>

<p>Over the last 1.5 years, we have conducted several interviews with parties deploying software in safety-critical or mission-critical environments. The participants were diverse, from cloud providers to vehicle manufacturers. We found broad interest in adopting Rust in those industries.</p>

<p>There were several key takeaways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rust as a language is seen as the big contender in critical spaces. Particularly, its focus on rigor and stability is seen as a major competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>At the same time, language evolution and improvement speed is also a crucial factor of interest.</li>
  <li>There is a desire for improvement over current language specification practices.</li>
  <li>Rust only having one main compiler at the moment is seen as a strength at the current phase of the language.</li>
  <li>Interviewed organisations see the language on a good trajectory towards their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>On further investigation, we found a lot of openness and desire for modern, tool-assisted specification and verification techniques. Rust was regarded as being on a good path and quoted as being a language that was already easier to analyze and inspect than other languages. For that reason, we researched existing practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we overwhelmingly found that the projects and tools already providing analysis and further safety guarantees operate on <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a>, Rust's mid-level intermediate representation, and other IR rather than the Rust source language. They utilized MIR to carry program meaning in a simplified manner, enabling easier analysis and reasoning. As such, a desire expressed was visibility into changes to MIR and versioned stability.</p>

<p>When further interviewed on stability, organizations expressed a desire to adopt a technology that continually increases safety and assurance levels. Most organizations considered stability a consequence of structured, deliberate changes between documented milestones one can predictably target. We summed this up as "addressability". This framing resonated in interviewed organizations.</p>

<p>There was a high respect for Rust's software practices both inside and outside of the main project. It was mentioned as a strong point that many traditionally research-related tasks are conducted within the project.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there was a shared desire to produce safer, higher-quality software <strong>faster</strong> and a sense that <strong>fundamental changes are necessary</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-orientation-why-ferrocene">Finding an orientation: why Ferrocene?</h2>

<p>A key question from these discussions with industry-leaders: what is Ferrocene, the product, and how does it relate to Rust? There was strong interest from potential clients that work that <em>can be</em> upstreamed into the Rust compiler <em>should be</em> wherever possible. We believe this points to a focus shift in the industry. Companies understand the value of FOSS as a neutral commons but also want to invest through initiatives that work towards their goals.</p>

<p>There are services required for mission and safety-critical industries that go beyond shipping a compiler. This includes (very) long-term support, qualification packages, industry-specific tooling, backends and targets, training, verification help and industry-specific advice. This is Ferrocene, the product.</p>

<p>During our conversations with industry leaders, we found that there's a need for Ferrocene as a wider initiative. Increasing the trust level of the Rust compiler will benefit many industries, and focusing only on typical safety-critical environments is one part of the picture. Improvements in the trust level of the core technology benefit <em>all</em> participants in the ecosystem. For example, we see efforts in better describing the semantics of Rust as it exists today as an important baseline for guiding the evolution of the language.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is both. It is a product to serve markets that need high assurances and committments. It is an initiative to take Rust to the next level of reliabilty and trust. Out of that comes a strong desire for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-direction-first-waypoints">Having a direction: First Waypoints</h2>

<p>We intend to publish a solidified roadmap for Ferrocene by June 2021.</p>

<p>A major early milestone for Ferrocene is achievable criticality levels. Currently, we're aiming at ISO 26262/ASIL-B qualification readiness and general availability by the end of 2022. Along the way, we will work closely with early adopters to increase the toolchain's quality and gather feedback and experiences.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is a vehicle for a versioned Rust and MIR specification, paired with automated verification of Rust semantics. These "runnable specs" give developers in mission-critical and high-security environments a sound, proven, and addressable foundation for building critical libraries, analysis tools, and further system assurances.</p>

<p>Critical Section is also committed to improving the developer experience in mission and safety-critical industries. Ferrocene includes efforts to bring existing verification tools, like MIRI, to a production-ready state, while also improving the ease and advanced capabilities of formally verifying Rust programs.</p>

<h2 id="finding-partners-the-travel-group">Finding Partners: The travel group</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also a lot of experiences to tap into.</p>

<p>Ferrous Systems and Critical Section are calling for additional partners to join that effort! We're interested in partners from many industries, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway and aerospace</li>
  <li>Operators of mission-critical infrastructure with high-reliability and security concerns, such as cloud vendors</li>
  <li>Hardware vendors</li>
  <li>Compiler vendors</li>
  <li>Organisations that require structured knowledge of their base systems</li>
  <li>Is interested in building strong, deep Rust knowledge now</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners also get early access to Ferrocene releases and can follow the development closely with engineer support.</p>

<p>If that describes your organisation, <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">we're happy to be in touch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h2>

<p>In August 2020, Ferrous Systems GmbH created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Critical Section GmbH. Critical Section started work on Ferrocene in September 2020, setting up roadmaps, finalizing user research, and outreach to partners. Ferrocene is currently managed by Florian Gilcher and Sabree Blackmon.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank Tim Reed and Jack Greenbaum from Green Hills Software for their constant advice, guidance and collaborative experimentation along the way.</p>

<p>YOUR ORDER HISTORY. Your credit card information. Even your intimate health data.</p>



<p>Amazon is amassing an empire of data as the online retailer ventures into ever more areas of our lives. But the company's efforts to protect the information it collects are inadequate, according to insiders who warn the company's security shortfalls expose users' information to potential breaches, theft and exploitation.</p>



<p>The warnings about privacy and compliance failures at Amazon come from three former high-level information security employees — one EU-based and two from the U.S. — who told POLITICO they had repeatedly tried to alert senior leadership in the company's Seattle HQ, only to be sidelined, dismissed or pushed out of the company in what they saw as professional retaliation. </p>



<p>The EU-based employee is fighting the terms of their departure from Amazon through European courts. All three spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they could face retaliation or difficulties in the job market for discussing the details of non-public legal proceedings. </p>



<p>Put together, their accounts paint a picture of a corporate culture at Amazon that they say prioritizes growth over other factors, such as the security of customers' information, compliance with rules designed to safeguard that data and the careers of employees the company hired specifically to flag problems.</p>



<p>“Imagine if a company the size of Amazon had a breach? The issue is millions of people's personal identifiable information is at risk,” the first former U.S.-based information-security employee said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Amazon said that maintaining customers' trust by protecting their privacy and ensuring the security of their data is a "long-standing top priority" for the company. </p>



<p>"These inaccurate, unsubstantiated and dated claims don’t reflect our commitment to keeping personal information safe. Amazon has comprehensive, long-established privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place. We regularly audit our services to ensure compliance and have zero tolerance for employees at all levels who do not follow our policies," he said. </p>



<p>At a time when lawmakers and government officials are ramping up scrutiny of tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the employees' complaints are likely to strike a chord with regulators.</p>



<p>While Amazon has faced plenty of heat over its labor practices — including alleged efforts to suppress union activity at its warehouses — its handling of data has received less attention.</p>



<p>Yet the company is one of Big Tech's most powerful players when it comes to data, thanks to the hoards of customer information it collects via its e-commerce platform, its online advertising business and its gigantic cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. </p>



<p>Garfield Benjamin, a British academic <a href="https://inforrm.org/2020/01/29/amazon-echos-privacy-issues-go-way-beyond-voice-recordings-garfield-benjamin/" target="_blank">who has previously written about Amazon’s privacy lapses</a>, said that the company's "disregard for privacy and security" was indicative of a "big problem."</p>

<p>“It seems bizarre — although perhaps unfortunately all too common — that a company so intent on making data its primary business should have such poor practices,” Benjamin said when shown POLITICO’s findings. He added, "Is their hubris so great, their assumed power so unassailable, that they see themselves as completely untouchable?” </p>



<p>The consequence for consumers is more than potential loss of trust in Amazon's privacy and security practices. The company's practices leave it vulnerable<strong> </strong>to potential breaches or hacks that could put highly sensitive information into the hands of malicious actors. </p>



<p>The data Amazon holds includes order history, payment information, data collected through its advertising business and, for sellers on its platform, forms of identification. In the wrong hands, it could be held for ransom against the threat of online publication; deployed to defraud people; used to get access to other online accounts; or leveraged in phishing attacks in which stolen data is used to trick victims into paying a fee or revealing even more sensitive information.  </p>



<p>More broadly, the accounts raise questions about what corporate values are rewarded at a company that has risen quickly to become the world's dominant e-commerce player.</p>



<h3>Data labyrinth</h3>



<p>ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. information-security employees, data is at risk because Amazon has a poor grasp of what data it has, where it is stored and who has access to it. </p>



<p>“If you wanted to do a 'right to be forgotten,' it would be next to impossible for Amazon to identify all of the places where your data resides within their system,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. The right to be forgotten, or right to have data erased, is a key tool for citizens under several privacy regimes, including in Europe and California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second U.S.-based information-security professional confirmed Amazon's shaky understanding of what reams of personal information it holds. “Amazon has grown so fast, it doesn't know what it owns … &nbsp;They don't know where their data is at, so they don’t know if they are protecting it correctly,” the person said.</p>



<p>The company’s track record on key data-security principles — controlling who has access to what data, patching vulnerabilities, ability to detect hacks, even whether passwords are changed regularly — came in for particular flak<strong> </strong>from all of the insiders who, together, have decades of experience in the area of information security.</p>



<p>“The quality of the controls that Amazon has in place is appalling. We found hundreds of thousands of accounts where the employee is no longer there but they still have system access,” said the first former U.S.-based employee, adding that such a vast number was possible because of Amazon's massive workforce and rapid staff turnover.<strong> </strong>Amazon said it has strict procedures in place when employees leave the company that remove their access.</p>



<p>Amazon has struggled to patch vulnerabilities in its systems. According to internal security reports from 2016 and 2017 seen by one of the former employees,<strong> </strong>the company declared that it was managing to patch between 55 to 70 percent of its systems. The first former U.S.-based employee likened that to leaving a house with several windows and doors open. </p>



<p>“Amazon’s information technology general controls, considering my experience and where I've been in the past, would not have passed muster with most auditors,” the first former U.S.-based employee said. "They were just poorly managed."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weak controls mean the company may not even detect a hack. An internal Amazon memo seen by one of the former employees from June 2018 deemed there was a “very high” possibility of critical financial loss or reputational damage to the business because of the company’s “inability to identify adversarial events.”</p>

<p>Amazon said it was not aware of the reports and does not believe the claims to be accurate. It said that any historic concerns that are flagged through routine internal reporting would be fixed, which is the purpose of these processes.</p>



<p>The second former U.S.-based employee confirmed that Amazon fails to properly control access to systems, and that, in a company whose workforce has grown to more than 1 million, reams of personal information are accessible to people who do not have the appropriate role or responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You've got tens of thousands of … teams connecting to big data," said the second former U.S.-based employee. "You should have a way to follow all the different types of data. From a technology point of view, you need to know where the data is going and how it's being protected. That does not exist,” they said.</p>



<p>The former employees were careful to distinguish between issues around Amazon’s internal approach to data compliance and the company’s leading track record in data-security engineering — visible through the products and services developed by AWS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS’s cloud computing products are used by the likes of the U.S. government, and are widely seen as world-beating in terms of data security. One ex-employee described the security tools at Amazon’s disposal as “second to none,” but they said the strength of AWS tools in keeping systems secure is still dependent on how the end user applies them. They also noted that AWS is largely run separately from the rest of the company.  </p>



<p>The issue, they said, is that Amazon's data-security capabilities are undermined by the willingness of the company to override internal controls.</p>



<p>For instance, according to two of the former information-security professionals, data needed for new projects was sometimes improperly classified so that it would go through fewer internal checks. </p>



<p>The company said this is false. A spokesperson said it has comprehensive privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place that are observed by executives at all levels. The company regularly audits services to ensure compliance and employees may not be involved in decision-making outside of their role’s remit.</p>



<h3>'Woefully behind'</h3>



<p>EUROPE'S DATA-PROTECTION RULEBOOK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is credited by many for putting privacy on the agenda — especially within company boardrooms, where the fines of 4 percent of global turnover introduced by the legislation are often perceived as an existential threat.</p>



<p>Even so, it was only in late April 2018 — weeks before the regulation came into force — that Amazon created a dedicated team in the information-security department to address the incoming regulation. “The organization was woefully behind,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. Amazon said it had long-standing privacy and security teams and made a standard organizational change to centralize privacy resources in 2018.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I re-made my site with Eleventy, the pages didn't change much, but I had loads of fun adding new features. The most fun was <strong>webmentions</strong> and I'm here to convince you to add them!</p><p>First, let me step back and explain why webmentions exist—the IndieWeb.</p><p>Check out this official description of the IndieWeb:</p><blockquote><p>The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data—<strong>indieweb.org</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, a community of personal websites, connected together, used as identities, that makes ownership of data possible. 🦄 🌈 How does this all work?</p><ul><li>There's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">great IndieWeb resource</a> that will tell you everything you need to know</li><li>But, start here if you want to know <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">why the IndieWeb deserves your attention</a></li><li>When you're convinced, see this handy page for a <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">quick start to becoming a citizen of the IndieWeb</a></li><li>International IndieWebCamps are here to help—I wrote a <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/indiewebcamp/">post about my first IndieWebCamp visit</a><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/indiewebcamp2017.png" alt="Nuernberg IndieWebCamp 2017"><figcaption>Nürnberg IndieWebCamp 2017 (I'm in the bottom right)</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p>Now the juicy stuff!</p><p>I think the coolest thing about the IndieWeb is that it is decentralised. Currently, there is a handful of corporations that own much of our data. With webmentions, each person owns their own data and each person can communicate with others. Webmentions are basically a way to display on your personal site ways that others have interacted with your content.</p><p>On my site I display mentions and bookmarks. It's possible for someone to link to one of my blog posts within one of their blog posts or bookmarks. If they do this, I won't know about it unless they let me know about it. <a href="https://webmention.app/">Letting others know you've mentioned their posts can be done manually or can be automated</a>.</p><p>I also display likes, retweets and replies on blog posts that I have tweeted about. If the URL to my post is in my tweet, I can gather the interactions on that tweet and display them on that post. Although most social media platforms do not support webmentions, it's possible to gather them by using a great free service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p><p>Some people have had webmentions on their site for many years, so I am a bit behind. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495">Jeremy has had webmentions since 2013</a>. But, there are more people posting content online than ever before, and personal websites aren't shown the love they used to get.</p><p>So, there has never been a more pressing need to put content creation platforms (e.g. Medium) and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) second, and put your very own little corner of the web first 💖</p><p>I used Max Böck's post on <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">using webmentions in Eleventy</a> to get started. I was able to get something on the screen quickly with Max's advice, and then I refined the incoming data a bit. Here is a summary of what I did:</p><ul><li>Sign up via <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> - if this doesn't work right away, check out ways to <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">set up your website for indie logins</a> (I'm able to sign in by linking to my GitHub account on my site's homepage)</li><li>Add two <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to your HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: <code>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/xmlrpc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/webmention"&gt;</code></li><li>For social media mentions, sign up to <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a></li><li>Fetch <strong>all</strong> of your site's webmention data in JSON format using one of the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">webmention endpoints described by IndieWebCamp co-founder Aaron Parecki</a> and the API token provided by <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a></li><li>Shape your webmention data however you like - I filter webmentions into separate re-tweet, reply, like, mention, and bookmark functions using the <code>'wm-property'</code> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/ambrwlsn/website/blob/1d713ad9fbce19a9bd8821790fd51c1be62e1f76/src/filters/webmentions-filter.js#L51">filter functions</a> and before you say anything, yes I know they could be DRYer)</li><li>Use the data to display webmentions on your blog posts</li></ul><p>Here are some of my webmentions (from <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/from-gatsby-to-eleventy/">my Gatsby to Eleventy post</a>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/webmentions.png" alt="Amber's webmentions on her Gatsby to Eleventy post"></p><p>If all of this seems too difficult and inaccessible, please don't give up! I thought getting webmentions on my little static site would be <strong>way too difficult</strong>. But there are so many wonderful posts about setting up webmentions, and so many great people willing to help. I count myself as one of those people :) If you want to implement webmentions on your site and are stuck on any of the points I listed above, ping me on Twitter and I'll do my best to help out.</p></div></div>]]>

PSAC announced the results of the vote Wednesday.</p>  <p>"They perform vital work protecting Canada from foreign cyber and attacks, foreign hacking attempts,"&nbsp;Alex Silas, PSAC's regional executive vice-president for the National Capital Region, told&nbsp;CBC News.</p>  <p>"For example, things that we saw this past July, there was an attempt to hack Canadian COVID-19 research. These are the workers that stopped that."</p>    <p>CSE,&nbsp;one of Canada's key intelligence agencies, employs&nbsp;about&nbsp;2,900 people and&nbsp;is responsible for foreign intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>  <p>The vote comes nearly two years after talks&nbsp;stalled on a collective agreement. At issue is a change to the&nbsp;market allowance —&nbsp; a wage supplement negotiated to close pay gaps with workers doing similar work in the private sector. It's a benefit&nbsp;often used to attract employees into highly technical jobs in the public service.</p>  <p>"CSE management is refusing to apply a wage increase to the portion of workers' salaries that is&nbsp;made up of market allowances," said Silas.</p>  <p>"To give you an idea, for some of these workers [that] represents as much as 10 per cent of their annual income.&nbsp;So it's a significant financial loss."</p>  <p>The vote&nbsp;does not mean&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;heading for the picket lines.</p>  <p>"We are now ramping up preparations and coordinating with our members to determine the precise actions that will be taken and their timing. But we emphasize that strike action can still be avoided if CSE management comes back to the table and steps away from its concession or agrees to arbitration," said PSAC spokesperson&nbsp;Alroy Fonseca.</p>  <h2>CSE says services will continue</h2>  <p>Christopher Williams, director general of CSE public affairs and communications services, said CSE's executive management team continues to work toward&nbsp;a resolution with the union.</p>  <p>"However, we can tell you that essential service agreements are in place to ensure that all areas of&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;have the people at work necessary to continue to provide for the safety and security of the public in the event of a strike," he said in an email to CBC News.</p>  <p>CSE has been sounding the alarm about the threat of cyber&nbsp;attacks on research facilities and the health care sector during the pandemic. It was one of the intelligence agencies that stated a hacker group backed by Russia&nbsp;"almost certainly" tried&nbsp;to steal COVID-19-related vaccine research in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.</p>  <p>Late last year, CSE warned that state-sponsored actors are "very likely" trying to shore up their cyber capabilities to attack Canada's&nbsp;critical infrastructure — such as the electricity&nbsp;supply&nbsp;— to intimidate or to prepare for future online assaults.</p>  <p>While the lights will remain on, the union says the agency will lose workers if it doesn't offer&nbsp;competitive salaries.</p>  <p>"What does it say about how we prioritize national security?" said Silas.&nbsp;"If CSE as an employer, as management, doesn't recognize the need to pay these workers a fair market rate, how are we going to attract and retain the talent needed for the important work of keeping Canadians safe from cyber attacks?"</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>Running Tide Technologies, a Portland-based company that operates traditional oyster farms, has just emerged from stealth with a big, bold plan to sequester gigatons of CO2 on the ocean floor over the next several years by growing kelp and then sinking it to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The company has been keeping its cards close to the vest, but Fast Company magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90548820/forget-planting-trees-this-company-is-making-carbon-offsets-by-putting-seaweed-on-the-ocean-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> today revealing Running Tide’s plan to leverage its aquaculture expertise to tackle the issue of climate change. Its plan, according to the magazine, is to grow kelp, which like other plants extracts carbon dioxide from the environment, on floating rigs and then sink them to the ocean floor. Once there, the CO2 could remain sequestered for centuries.</p>
<p>“Once it goes down below 1,000 meters, it’s not coming back up, because the pressures are so great,” Marty Odlin, Running Tide’s founder and CEO, told Fast Company. “So you can get at least 1,000 years of sequestration. More likely, it will turn into oil or sediment and be sequestered on the geologic timescale—millions of years.”</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial forests that can burn or degrade and release the carbon back into the atmosphere, marine plants don’t break down as easy. Plus, coastal&nbsp;ecosystems sequester up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests, <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to this article</a> published by Harvard University.</p>
<p>Running Tide <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated its website</a> this week. While previously focused on traditional shellfish aquaculture, it now includes language about its “negative emissions journey” to combat climate change with its kelp. It also says that Running Tide will be selling “kelp carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Maine Startups Insider had heard rumors about the company and how it had been able to attract big-time VC money. MSI <a href="https://mainestartupsinsider.com/has-silicon-valley-big-shot-chris-sacca-invested-in-a-maine-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article last week</a> speculating that Chris Sacca, one of Silicon Valley’s most well-known venture capitalists, had invested in the company via his new VC firm, Lowercarbon Capital. Sacca did not respond to MSI’s requests for confirmation, but did announce his firm’s investment in the Portland company on Twitter after the Fast Company article was published.</p>
<p>“Bonkers scale, unreasonable ambition, massive impact on the plant. During insane times, it’s entrepreneurs like @martyodlin that fire us up,” Sacca tweeted.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Running Tide was the kind of company we were hoping we would find when we started <a href="https://twitter.com/lowercarbon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lowercarbon</a>.

<p>Shopify, the ecommerce behemoth, also revealed itself this week as an investor in Running Tide. The ecommerce-platform company last year launched its Sustainability Fund to fight climate change. On Monday, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund/ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it shared in a blog post</a> how it invested its first $5 million, including an investment of undisclosed size in Running Tide.</p>
<p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster,” Odlin told Shopify. “Everyone should try to slow it down, but we should pick 15–20 technologies that might be able to stop the whole thing all by themselves. That’s what we’re trying to build.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not been successful getting the company to confirm how much it raised, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/266342-50#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but Pitchbook claims</a> it raised $11.2 million in November 2019. In addition to Lowercarbon Capital and Shopify,&nbsp;PitchBook lists three additional investors: Soraya Darabi, an angel investor, San Francisco-based Pathbreaker Ventures, and San Francisco-based Yes VC.</p>
<p>David Frankel, a partner at Boston-based Founder Collective, also revealed on Twitter on Tuesday that he had led the seed financing.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/proudfirstinvestor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#proudfirstinvestor</a> </p>
<p>Honored to have led Running Tide's seed financing.</p>
