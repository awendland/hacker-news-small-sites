<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>

<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

           started by placing pieces of the frog’s thigh muscles in a sterilised plastic tube smaller than the size of a little finger. But muscle cells also contain other components, such as proteins, which come in the way of isolating DNA. A cocktail of chemicals is used to break open the muscle cells, dissolve the proteins and separate the DNA for purification.</p></div><p>Another chemical dunk helped isolate the three specific genes Vijay was after.

              </p> <p>o what is a species? In the seventeenth century, European thinkers proposed that a group of organisms that could breed with each other could be called a species. A century on, Carl Linnaeus, the pioneering Swedish naturalist, popularised the use of combining two Latin terms: first the name of the genus,
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="u7ivdfqvucs5">[8]</sup>
            </a>
           then that of the species. The yellow-eyed bush frog has the name <em>Raorchestes </em>because it signifies the genus <em>Raorchestes</em>, which encompasses almost 65 species of bush frogs mostly from South Asia; <em>flaviocularis</em>&nbsp;is its species.</p></div><p>For all this time, scientists have been having furious arguments about the best way to classify species. There are presently more than 30 approaches to define a species, variously based in ancestry, ecology, appearances, even sound. The general consensus these days is to take an “integrative” approach. So Vijay started off with <em>flaviocularis</em>’s distinct looks––its morphology––and then worked on tracing its family tree in the DNA lab. The distinctiveness of its metallic calls, as well as its geographical distribution, helped along the hypothesis that <em>flaviocularis</em> was a species that hadn’t been described previously.</p><p>“Documenting the existence of a species is the first step to understanding our biodiversity,” Shanker said. It’s an exciting field because there is so much we don’t know. Ecologists have terms of art associated with these knowledge gaps. The Linnean Shortfall refers to the problem of undescribed lineages. A Wallacean Shortfall
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="wszrks8kngx3">[9]</sup>
            </a>
           refers to the lack of information about a species’ geographical distribution. “These shortfalls are the starting point for our exploration of ecology and evolution. There are lots of questions that can be answered once both these knowledge gaps are addressed,” said Shanker.</p><p>One set of questions is evolutionary in nature: Where did a species originate? If it started from Africa, how did it find its way into Asia and diversify? That’s how we got Asian elephants for instance: fossil remains indicate that the first elephant ancestors originated in Africa during the geological epoch known as the Early Pliocene.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="hfc0ff8tqwol">[10]</sup>
            </a>
           Recent genetic and fossil studies now confirm that their descendants moved into Asia 2-4 million years ago, and gave rise to the modern Asian elephant just 2.5 lakh years ago.</p><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>Geographic barriers such as deep gorges and wide rivers also affect dispersal, and can isolate populations. The gaps and valleys of the Western Ghats explain why there are so many different kinds of bush frogs. A species’ own ability to move around determines the kind of places it eventually gets to: birds are likelier than frogs to move from one mountain to another, for example.</p><p>Then they could ask after ecological factors such as rainfall, temperature and altitude, gradients along which species can adapt and evolve into different groups. </p></div><p>Finally, there are questions related to conservation. Research may focus on the availability of a type of plant if it appears that a species relies on it for survival. This data is analysed to help us approach answers to speculative questions like: what could happen to the species a hundred years from now; how would they adapt to climate change? </p><p>One of the things that is clear after a couple of centuries of study is that the species richness of a region increases as you move from the poles to the tropics. Within the tropics, you get “biodiversity hotspots.”

           These are sites that represent only 2.4% of the earth’s land surface, support more than 40% of endemic fauna, and are threatened by human habitation.</p><p>The Himalayas, with an estimated 10,000 species of plants including more than 3,100 endemics, is one of them. The states of north-eastern India that form part of the larger Indo-Burma hotspot are another. But easily the most well-studied hotspot in India is the Western Ghats.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Two</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>he Western Ghats stretch almost parallel to India’s west coast. They variously constitute about 1600kms of sparse and dense forests, blue mountains, steep cliffs, thorny bushes, flat plateaus, leech-ridden swamps and windy grasslands. At one end, they start as shrub-bearing hillocks about 10km north of India’s southernmost tip. Then, they become the Ashambu Hills, mighty granite mountains forming a natural border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in the shadow of which lie spice gardens and homesteads.</p></div><p>Then comes the Shencottah Gap. After those 7km, the Ghats rise again to form the Meghamalai Hills, home of <em>flaviocularis</em>, the yellow-eyed bush frog. These are followed by a small plateau which leads to the hills of Palani and Anamalai. Cardamom, coffee and tea plantations blanket the slopes here. Look up, and mist permitting, you can see some of the tallest peaks in the south—“sky islands,” hosting ecosystems wildly different from those of the surrounding lowlands. In the shallow valleys of these highlands, naturally stunted forests known as the “sholas” occur alongside open grassland patches. </p><p>North of the Anamalais come the Nilgiris. But first, there’s a deep valley. At 32km wide, 100m above sea level, the Palghat Gap is the widest and lowest pass in the Ghats. A dusty national highway cuts right through it, connecting Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala.</p><p>Beyond, the Ghats stretch into north Kerala and Karnataka, its high peaks separated occasionally by shallow valleys. They almost kiss the Arabian Sea before swerving east into Goa. By the time they taper off amidst the sugarcane fields of Maharashtra, they are less imposing and more climbable, now ambling along until they reach their other end in the deciduous forest tracts of south Gujarat.&nbsp; </p><p>The remarkable contiguity broken by wide gaps and valleys, the sheer range of landscapes, the distance covered: all this should indicate why the Ghats are a species discovery hotspot. They comprise less than 6% of India’s land area but are home to more than 30% of all plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species found in the country. Of the 406 known frog and toad species in India, more than 200 are endemic to the Ghats. Over a hundred of these endemics have been discovered only in the last 20 years. </p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Three</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>NA-based techniques have transformed new species research across the world. Uma Ramakrishnan, a conservation geneticist and professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences who led the genetic component of the research on sholakilis and chilappans, told me that India was still heavily reliant on morphological methods and distribution information till about a decade ago. Now there’s a whole suite of new technologies, including better computational and simulation programmes, that have popularised the use of genetic techniques to answer ecological questions. These technologies both advance and confirm the educated hunches researchers develop as they work.</p></div><p>There’s a flip side to this, too: taxonomic inflation, the over-categorisation of newly sighted animals. Some experts feel that researchers have begun claiming the tag of “new species” in cases where it is clearly unwarranted. Robin Kurian Abraham, a researcher at the University of Kansas, told me that the “overinflation” problem afflicts some Indian frog lineages too. Often, “new species” might just be sub-species, or different populations of the same species. “Why is it that we rarely hear of sub-species in frogs? There are even five extant sub-species of tigers across the world,” Abraham asked me.</p><p>The ‘species versus sub-species’ debate has been raging for years. Take the world of wolf taxonomy as an example. The grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus)</em> is found in most parts of the world. In 2018, a paper published in <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em> by a team of researchers led by Geraldine Werhahn created a splash. DNA analysis using scat and hair samples of the Himalayan wolf had revealed a genetic adaptation to cope with the lower oxygen levels of high altitudes.</p><p>It provided a massive shot in the arm to the theory that the Himalayan wolf is evolutionarily distinct: its lineage diverged before the radiation of the modern grey wolf. But the journey to species-hood is long and arduous. In February last year, Werhahn told <em>The Guardian</em> that researchers needed to obtain one final piece of higher-quality genomic data for the separate species case to succeed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN, the global organisation which evaluates and assesses conservation status. That quest is still on.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

But, when compared to optical approaches, radar resolution is challenging, especially at orbital altitude due to the large physical antenna sizes necessary for handling electromagnetic waves 4,000x longer than visible light. To improve resolution, <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/sar-101-an-introduction-to-synthetic-aperture-radar-2f0b6246c4a0" target="_blank">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) combines data from multiple radar pulses as a platform moves past a target, creating images with resolutions comparable to an infeasibly large <a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/radariii.html" target="_blank">real aperture radar</a>. (Another way to visualize SAR is that it works similarly to <a href="https://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html" target="_blank">phased-array antennas,</a> but multiplexes a single antenna in time relative to a stationary target vs multiple antennas in space relative to a moving target.) SAR, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar#History" target="_blank">first developed in the ‘50s</a> for military applications, has led to important scientific findings, such as the <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target="_blank">terrain imaging of Venus</a> and the detection of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (<a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/450/titanlakes.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>). Today’s SAR systems have increased resolution and decreased cost, leading to a boom in smallsat SAR data from multiple new providers, including <a href="https://www.ursaspace.com/" target="_blank">Ursa</a>, <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella</a>, <a href="https://www.iceye.com/" target="_blank">ICEYE</a>, <a href="https://i-qps.net/" target="_blank">iQPS</a>, <a href="https://www.predasar.com/" target="_blank">PredaSAR</a>, <a href="https://synspective.com/" target="_blank">Synspective</a>, and <a href="https://umbra.space/" target="_blank">Umbra</a> (who <a href="https://spacenews.com/umbra-raises-32-million/" target="_blank">just raised $32 million in additional funding</a>). Capella Space is one of the industry leaders with resolutions of 50cm x 50cm from a 10-meter antenna deployed from a ~40kg smallsat (two of these were on Transporter-1, see below). According to Capella's lead SAR scientist, this resolution would require a real aperture radar of 49 km (yes, <em>kilo</em>meters). SAR resolution along the orbital ground track (aka “azimuth” or “cross-range” resolution) is determined by radar pulse processing frequency—and therefore doesn't degrade with altitude, unlike optical and real aperture radar—, while the side looking "range" resolution is primarily determined by the radar's wavelength (many high-res SAR platforms use the ~3 cm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band" target="_blank">8–12 GHz X-band</a>, including Capella). SAR's drawbacks include vertical height distortion (called layover and foreshortening) and shadowing due to its side-looking orientation in relation to the craft's ground track (SAR cannot look straight down). SAR is also unable to accurately observe moving targets and can produce significant amounts of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference)" target="_blank">speckling</a>” and noise due to reflectance from rough surfaces and corners (a good <a href="https://youtu.be/u2bUKEi9It4" target="_blank">recent video overview</a> of SAR). But, its side-looking orientation enables its high range (or “cross-track”) resolution, and when paired with elevation maps it can be used to reconstruct 3D models of the observation area—an <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar" target="_blank">intro to SAR course from NASA</a>. Commercial applications of high-resolution SAR data have been speculated on (including your usual suspects of maritime tracking, crop monitoring, defense intelligence, and climate, with compelling all-weather natural disaster response added to the mix), but we don’t have many examples of real-world commercial use-cases just yet. Related: the <a href="https://asf.alaska.edu/#" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a> has a good repository of SAR data available if you’d like to experiment with some yourself.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/c4984c9b-9c36-45b2-aaea-f57a94b357f4.jpg" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td><p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" target="_blank">SAR image</a> of a floating Chinese solar farm including panels, apparently laid out to resemble a fish.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">¶</a><strong id="all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">All the missions on Transporter-1.</strong> So what was in the flotilla of 143 satellites launched on SpaceX’s Jan 24th Transporter-1 rideshare mission?

<p><strong>Pipenv</strong> is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. <em>Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.</em></p>
<p>It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code>, which is used to produce deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of <code><span>setup.py</span></code> vs <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> to define dependencies, see <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy"><span>☤ Pipfile vs setup.py</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"><img alt="a short animation of pipenv at work" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"></a></p><p>The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need to use <code><span>pip</span></code> and <code><span>virtualenv</span></code> separately. They work together.</li>
<li>Managing a <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> and <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code> to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.</li>
<li>Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">arising from outdated components</a>.</li>
<li>Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>graph</span></code>).</li>
<li>Streamline development workflow by loading <code><span>.env</span></code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly play with Pipenv right in your browser:</p>

<h2>Install Pipenv Today!<a href="#install-pipenv-today" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you’re using Fedora 28:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo dnf install pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, <strong>this is now discouraged</strong>, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You’ll then need to re-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Technology is a concentrating force. It always has been.</p>
<p>Everybody sewed their own clothes until we built textile factories.</p>
<p>It used to take one farmer to feed four people. Now each farmer feeds 130 people.</p>
<p>Home Depot killed thousands of local hardware stores. Opendoor is replacing legions of Keller-Williams agents. Salman Khan teaches algebra to more kids than the next 10,000 math teachers combined.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, <span>USD</span>, <span>CNY</span>, and <span>EUR</span> are all converging on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. <em>How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?</em></p>
<p>The internet, contrary to popular opinion, is accelerating the pace of centralization.</p>
<p>Software is centralizing in the App Store. Compute is centralizing in AWS-US-EAST-1. Culture is centralizing on TikTok. Stock trades are centralizing in Citadel’s dark pool. Politics are centralizing around personality. Work and cities are centralizing online.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a narrative mirage because three trends are frequently misinterpreted: the downfall of institutions, the death of the gatekeeper, and remote work.</p>
<p>These aren’t representative of decentralization, but instead are examples of increasing concentration.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-failing.">1.<span></span> <span>“</span>Institutions are failing.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/personality-is-the-force-majeure-of-the-internet">Personality is the force majeure of the internet</a>. In a noisy world, it’s much easier to diligence an individual than it is to understand institutional motives. <em>Who supports NPR? Who’s the <span>NYT</span><span></span><span>’</span>s customer? Advertisers? <span>PR</span> people? Me? What are we being sold?</em></p>
<p>Institutions aren’t crumbling because of decentralization, but rather the opposite: institutional power is being compressed into personalities.</p>
<p>Trump became the <span>GOP</span>. <span>AOC</span> is becoming the <span>DNC</span>. Dave Portnoy is becoming <span>ESPN</span>. Sam Harris is now <span>NPR</span>. Elon is Tesla.</p>
<p>Organizational power is inherently decentralized. Shareholders vote for board members. Boards approve plans. Plans coordinate across loosely-coupled internal orgs.</p>
<p>But individual power, like autocratic government, is singular.</p>
<p>Directives no longer need to flow through layers of hierarchy. Tesla no longer needs a network of dealers to sell cars on <a href="https://tesla.com/">tesla.com</a>, nor do they need an army of salespeople. Why listen to Bob at the local showroom when you can follow Elon on Twitter?</p>
<p>It’s the same in politics. We used to elect state representatives who would elect electors in the legislature who would elect a President. Then communication and transportation improved. We got railroads and national radio, so we put the Presidential candidates directly on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the President doesn’t even need <span>TV</span> stations: they can instantly drop messages into the pockets of <span>80M</span> followers.</p>
<p>Betting on the internet means betting against institutions,<a href="#footnote-11TX" id="ref-11TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not because institutions are exploding supernovas but because institutions are imploding black holes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gatekeepers-are-dead.">2.<span></span> <span>“</span>The gatekeepers are dead.”</h3>
<p>It’s true, gatekeepers are dead. It’s a huge improvement over the pre-Internet era.</p>
<p>I never learned about Richard Dawkins growing up. Then I went down a Carl Sagan <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> rabbit hole. I discovered Christopher Hitchens talking about evolution, consumed all of his religious debates, and then came across this Oxford evolutionary biologist who wore funny ties. <em>The Selfish Gene</em> fundamentally changed the way I view the world.</p>
<p>YouTube extends far beyond space videos. There’s debates about quantum theory, <span>DIY</span> construction how-to’s, makeup tutorials, and an unbelievable amount of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>The best part? There’s no school board deciding what you can and can’t watch and there’s no <span>MTV</span> exec telling David Dobrik what he can and can’t upload.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think the unlimited nature of content is a decentralizing force. Yet the reality is that winning content in an unlimited world is watched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift can reach billions of listeners, Salman Khan can teach algebra to millions of students, the best Stack Overflow answers get upvoted thousands of times.</p>
<p>Imagine if San Francisco had no zoning rules. There’d be cranes and giant skyscrapers everywhere. The city would be reaching Tokyo-level density, concentrating people in the Bay Area from across the country.</p>
<p>The internet is a supercharged no-zoning Bay Area. YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Shopify are all limitless. Their success is exponential, like the weight of gravity, pulling in more and more eyeballs.</p>
<p>The gap between first place and second place is far more pronounced online than it ever was offline. 30-45% of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. Walmart managed to handle only 9% of physical retail at their peak.<a href="#footnote-21TX" id="ref-21TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Power is shifting to the dancer who can get featured by TikTok’s algorithm, to the business that can place first in Google’s results, to the reseller that pays the most to top Amazon’s catalog, to the singer that can get featured in Spotify’s <em>Discover Weeklies</em>.</p>
<p>The long tail of content is a distraction from the reality: online power is concentrating in an extreme power law. Yes, anybody can build a following. But the winners dwarf the long tail.</p>
<p>After all, audiences are so concentrated that it only took three companies to silence the sitting <span>POTUS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-remote-work">3.<span></span> <span>“</span>But what about remote work?”</h3>
<p>I miss going into Industrious. I’d wake up, walk to FiDi, pour myself a cup of coffee in a grey mug, sit in a mid-century modern green chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>When I flew to Chicago, I’d take a train to the Fulton Market Industrious, pour myself coffee in a grey mug, sit on a mid-century chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>Fly to Atlanta? Ride to Ponce. Coffee, grey mug, green chair, work.</p>
<p>New York? Union Square. Coffee. Chair. Work.</p>
<p>As people move their work lives online, the experience everywhere is going to be the same. Morning ride on the Peloton, get to WeWork, drink some Blue Bottle, hop on a video call, order groceries from Instacart, rinse and repeat. The only difference will be whether we see palm trees or wildfire smoke out the window.</p>
<p>The<span></span> <span>“</span>everyone is leaving <span>SF</span><span></span><span>”</span> narrative isn’t about decentralization, it’s about centralizing online. Everybody is on Zoom now.<span></span> <span>“</span>Remote work” doesn’t mean you can now live some exotic life in a faraway place, it means that people in Birmingham can live the same as those in Cow Hollow. And work for the same companies, too.</p>
<p>Not only are we all working on Zoom, but we’re all shopping on the same<span></span> <span>“</span>hip” street, the one with Warby Parker and Bonobos and Lululemon and La Colombe all lined up side by side. Sub-in Blue Bottle, and I’ll tell you if you’re east or west of the Mississippi.<a href="#footnote-31TX" id="ref-31TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of it is that capital is cheap and management can be centralized, so chains are able to grow quickly nationwide without leaning on franchise models.<a href="#footnote-41TX" id="ref-41TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the other part is that our tastes as Americans are compressing. Every town has incredible breweries, third wave coffee, Trader Joe’s, and a Costco out in the suburbs. We’re all watching Netflix and Charli D’Amelio. We’re all peddling to the same bike instructors as Biden. How much longer until we all lose our regional accents, too?</p>
<h3 id="uploading">Uploading…</h3>
<p>Everything is shifting online. From how we find office space, to get rides, to feed ourselves, to exercise, to work and to live.</p>
<p>The meme that this constitutes<span></span> <span>“</span>decentralization” is like the ocean on the edge of the Saharan horizon. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The spectrum of opinions, of tastes, of behaviors is compressing. The platforms and personalities with power will continue to grow in size. The power law of the internet remains irrefutable.</p>
<p>Soon one farmer will feed 1,300 people, robots will sew our Nikes, there will be one nationwide math teacher and a single wealth ledger.</p>
<p>And our lives will be fully uploaded.</p>

            <p>Don’t use Homebrew Python. It’s not meant for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>At some point Homebrew made changes that adversely affect Python development. While Homebrew’s Python formula has been the go-to choice for Python developers (including me) for a long time, that time is past — there are now <em>much</em> better options&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" title="I’ve talked about some macOS-specific reasons to eschew its bundled Python, but Ubuntu/Debian is also affected.">1</a></sup>, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable&nbsp;error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dyld</span><span>:</span> <span>Library</span> <span>not</span> <span>loaded</span><span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>executable_path</span><span>/../</span><span>.</span><span>Python</span>
<span>Referenced</span> <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>/your/home/.virtualenvs/your-env-name/bin/</span><span>python</span>
<span>Reason</span><span>:</span> <span>image</span> <span>not</span> <span>found</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change&nbsp;anything!</p>
<p><em>You</em> didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did. Of the adverse changes Homebrew made recently, two stand out as root causes of this&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>First, Homebrew now upgrades dependent packages automatically. So if you upgrade <em>any</em> package that depends on the <code>python</code> formula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" title="You can see which of your installed formulae depend on the python formula by running: brew uses python --installed … I have over 30 Python-dependent formulae installed on my workstation.">2</a></sup> (and there are nearly <strong>400</strong> of them), then your Python interpreter will be upgraded also — whether you like it or not. You have no control over&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Second, Homebrew now automatically deletes previous versions every 30 days, including of course any Python interpreters you used to create virtual&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>The havoc wrought by the combination of these two changes is considerable. Those Python virtual environments you created over the last year? All of them are now broken. Why? Just because you ran <code>brew upgrade ponysay</code>? Yup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" title="Previously, you had to manually run brew cleanup to get yourself into this mess. Now the carnage happens automatically. Any time a new Python version is released, even patch releases such as from 3.8.6 to 3.8.7, there is the very real potential that any virtual environment that depends on the previous Python version will just break horribly and without any warning. And it’s not just your virtual environments — any software that depends on Python can have the carpet yanked out from under it, including Pipx, YouCompleteMe, and other components that you may not even realize depend on the presence of a stable Python foundation. Moreover, this problem isn’t even confined to Python. Need a specific version of Node.js to build static assets for your web application? Have an old Rails app that needs a previous Ruby version? Under the Homebrew regime, those can also be swept away at any&nbsp;time.">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="homebrew-python-is-not-for-you">Homebrew Python Is Not For&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>The web is littered with frustrated reports about this problem and replete with hacked-together Bash scripts that purport to repair damaged Python virtual environments. And all because of one core&nbsp;misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Homebrew’s Python is not for you. It exists to serve Homebrew, or more accurately, Homebrew’s other formulae. The primary purpose of Homebrew’s Python formula is to enable other Python-dependent Homebrew packages to work. If installing Homebrew’s Python allows you to run the occasional Python script or access the <abbr title="read-eval-print loop"><span>REPL</span></abbr><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" title="Assuming you’re okay with bundled Python caveats, there’s no reason to install Homebrew just for Python, since macOS includes Python 3 in its command-line tools (CLT) package.">4</a></sup>, that’s a nice side benefit, but anything beyond that — including developing software with Python — is squarely&nbsp;out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Once you come to this realization, it should be clear that this is the wrong tool for the job. So what is the right&nbsp;tool?</p>

<p>There are several solutions that put <strong>you</strong> back in control of when Python versions are installed, upgraded, and removed. Personally, I use <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python">Python plugin</a> to do <a href="https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">just that</a>. I prefer <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> to similar tools such as Pyenv and Pythonz because not only can you install multiple Python versions but also multiple Node.js versions, Ruby versions, and <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list">many more</a>.</p>
<p>After switching to this solution, would you like to guess how many times I’ve had something break due to a Python upgrade? Right: <em>Zero</em>. Zero times. Because <strong>I</strong> am now in control of when older Python versions are swept away, I can upgrade virtual environments at my leisure, and then, once I’ve confirmed no other environments rely on older versions, I can then uninstall those old Python versions without worrying about something&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>There are hack workarounds, and I’ve tried them. None of them fix the core&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>For example, the automatic monthly clean-up can be disabled by defining a <code>HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP</code> environment variable and setting it to “1”. But all it takes is one accidental <code>brew</code> invocation in a shell session where that variable is not set, and your environments are laid to waste. Plus, even if you avoid that footgun, there is no easy way to remove specific old versions that you may no longer need; you have no choice but to <code>rm -rf</code> directories in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/</code> and hope you don’t break&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I also tried to avoid installing Homebrew Python entirely, with the idea that since I’m not using it anymore, I don’t need it to be installed. But assuming you use Homebrew to install other tools, that would be a fool’s errand — Homebrew Python will almost certainly be installed anyway when some other formula requires it. But that doesn’t mean we have to use it! Let the Homebrewed Python sit there and do its job serving other formulae, and we can forget it&nbsp;exists.</p>

a description of some property of your system from a description of the domain

'addition' operation, you might what to check the <em>property</em> that it's

you're new to this, I recommend trying to write at least one proptest, then
reading the advice below.</p> <p>This is not going to be a basic 'How to proptest' tutorial. There are many, many
treatments of that subject; you should probably start with the documentation for
your language's proptest library. A few of my favorites are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proptest (Rust)</a> (We use this extensively at Auxon)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test.check (Clojure)</a></li> <li><a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis (Python)</a></li></ul> <p>Property-based testing libraries are extensively available. There's probably one
you can use in your language of choice.</p> <h3 id="why-proptest"><a href="#why-proptest">#</a> Why Proptest?</h3> <p>Testing and specification can be thought of as a spectrum of rigor. On the
least-rigorous end, we have manual testing and regular written specifications.
Moving up, we find automated unit / integration test and executable
specification languages (like Cucumber, another popular tool at Auxon). Then
there's a massive gulf, and everything gets starts getting academic and
difficult; symbolic execution, model checking, and formal proofs show up at the far end.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.auxon.io/images/posts/effective-property-based-testing-1.png" alt="property-based"></p> <p>Proptests are somewhere in the middle, just a little past the tests you're
already doing. They're a very practical way of verifying your implementation
against a rigorous, executable specification. But they're not much harder to
write than the unit tests you're already doing.</p> <h3 id="terminology-check"><a href="#terminology-check">#</a> Terminology Check</h3> <p>Different proptest libraries use different words to talk about the same thing.
In this article, I'll use 'Generator' to talk about the thing that defines the
input domain for your proptest. (Some people refer to proptests as generative
testing). This is also known as a 'Strategy' in Rust proptest / Python
hypothesis parlance.</p> <p>Code examples will be written in Rust, but the concepts and recommendations
apply to any proptest framework.</p> <h2 id="write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite"><a href="#write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite">#</a> Write 'em, Compose 'em, Put 'em in a Suite</h2> <h3 id="item-1-develop-a-generator-library"><a href="#item-1-develop-a-generator-library">#</a> Item 1: Develop a Generator Library</h3> <p>Your program probably has a bunch of classes or data structures that it cares
about deeply, that are central to its operation and passed all around the
system. You should identify theses data structures and write generators for
them. You can do this incrementally, as you begin to work with proptests.</p> <h3 id="item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators"><a href="#item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators">#</a> Item 2: Be a little suspicious of type-based generators</h3> <p>Many proptest frameworks provide a way to make a generator directly from a
structure, type, or schema definition. These are of course very convenient, and
I've used them often. But they're not as clearly good as you might think.</p> <p>First, your types may not be as precise as what you need for your generators.
Maybe you have a single type which can have two distinct data variants (maybe
both valid and invalid requests?) which you want to generate separately. Second,
event if your type definition is fully precise, you may find that practical
execution considerations require you to make size or other input domain
restrictions in the generators. This happens fairly frequently.</p> <p>For these reasons, I recommend staying away for type-based generators for all
but the most simple applications. We've found that's it's best to just start
with standalone generators; it costs a little more up front, but I always end up
converting to them later on anyways. Clojure's <code>core.spec</code>-based generators are
an exception here, as they provide an ad-hoc way to override portions of the
generated generator. But even then, it's a fairly laborious process.</p> <h3 id="item-3-touch-test-your-generators"><a href="#item-3-touch-test-your-generators">#</a> Item 3: Touch-test your generators</h3> <p>When you're writing your generators, use your language's interactive execution
facilities to try them out. It's common to find unexpected variations in
proptest-generated data, and this can help you shortcut the "WHY did my tests
fail?" process. I've had a lot of success using this technique in Clojure.</p> <h3 id="item-4-learn-your-combinators"><a href="#item-4-learn-your-combinators">#</a> Item 4: Learn your Combinators</h3> <p>Proptest libraries are built from small generators that can be combined to form
more complex structures. Some of these are language/environment dependent, but
the important ones are common:</p> <ul><li><p>Primitive types - You'll start with generators for all the primitives in your
language: integers, floats, strings, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Collection types - Look for direct support for native collections in your
framework; you can use these to generate a collection of anything else you can
generate. Note that collection size can be bounded; you'll find this necessary
when developing larger compound generators.</p></li> <li><p><code>just</code> / <code>return</code> - Proptest frameworks always have a way to 'lift' a single
value, creating a generator that just spits out that value every time.</p></li> <li><p><code>map</code> - Transform a generated value in some way. You might use this to
generate numbers that have been converted to strings.</p></li> <li><p><code>filter</code> - Throw out generated values if they don't pass some test. This is
convenient but a little dangerous; see <a href="#filtering">below</a>.</p></li> <li><p><code>tuple</code> - Get data from multiple generators together. (This is kind of like
'and')</p></li> <li><p><code>one of</code> / <code>choose</code> - Get data from one of the given generators. (This is kind
of like 'or')</p></li> <li><p>data structures - Different frameworks approach this differently, but most
provide some amount of sugar to help you generate native data structures.
Lacking that, one effective strategy is to start with a <code>tuple</code> generator with
one item for each field in your data structure, then use <code>map</code> generator to
put them all together.</p></li> <li><p>recursive structures - If you want to generate a tree or some other kind of
recursive data structure, look for direct support for that in your framework.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering"><a href="#item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering">#</a> Item 5: Prefer Constructive Generation to Filtering</h3> <p>The <code>filter</code> combinator is really easy, and one of the first things people
reach for when writing proptests for the first time. The trouble with this
is that it's inefficient, and it can break down entirely when used broadly.</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to make a generator for even numbers. It's easy to do with <code>filter</code>:</p> <p>This works, but it's doing a lost of wasted work: half of all the numbers
generated by the first step will be thrown out. Suppose you did the same thing
to generate multiples of 10: you'll be throwing away 90% of your work. Powers of
two? That's way out of hand. Most proptest frameworks will abort execution if
they aren't able to generate a valid sample after some number of tries.</p> <p>This is not only a problem with single value generators: you'll find that as you
start to combine generators to produce more complex structures, the effects of
multiple filter-based generators will accumulate, and you'll be aborting
execution all the time.</p> <p>The solution to this is to instead build your generators constructively. Start
with a fully specified domain, then transform that to get what you want. This
can be tricky, and sometimes requires oblique thinking to get it right. In the
case of our even numbers, it's not too bad:</p> <p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule; there are plenty of times where <code>filter</code> is
the only choice. But you should beware of your <code>filter</code>'s selectivity, and be
careful of using it too much.</p> <h3 id="item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies"><a href="#item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies">#</a> Item 6: Use flatmap/bind for Data Dependencies</h3> <p>Many data structures have some kind of internal consistency requirement. For
example, you might have a record that contains a vector of strings, and an index
into that list representing a cursor. We'd like to only generate valid cursors.
(Sometimes you want to generate <em>invalid</em> cursors as well, of course)</p> <p>The naive way to do this might be to start with a <code>tuple</code> of the vector
generator and a cursor generator, and then use <code>filter</code> to remove all tuples
where the cursor is out of bounds:</p> <p>This is a correct and succinct way to specify the constraint, but you'll find
that your proptest framework probably gives up after generating too many
candidates that don't match. It's radically inefficient at best.</p> <p>The constructive way to do this is to start with a generator for the list of
strings, and then use <code>flatmap</code> (or <code>bind</code>, the names vary) to generate an
in-bounds index:</p> <h3 id="item-7-bound-your-collections"><a href="#item-7-bound-your-collections">#</a> Item 7: Bound your collections</h3> <p>When you're making generators for collection-typed values (Vectors, Lists,
Maps, etc), it's tempting to say "do this for ALL the possible collections!" In
terms of specification, that's correct. But in terms of execution, it can get
out of hand. Does your system <em>really</em> need to be able to handle 200 million
distinct zip codes?</p> <p>This can get especially bad if you have compound data structures with collections nested under other collections. Even if your implementation can gracefully handle the load, you may find that your proptest framework cannot.</p> <p>You should carefully consider what you actually care about verifying,
and target that. I often choose a 'reasonable' (which depends on the context)
limit to the size of straight collections of simple values. When dealing with
nested collections, the "zero, one, many" rule of thumb applies; <code>many == 2 or 3</code> typically works well.</p> <h2 id="look-it-s-a-propiphaunt"><a href="#look-it-s-a-propiphaunt">#</a> Look! It's a Propiphaunt!</h2> <h3 id="item-8-start-small"><a href="#item-8-start-small">#</a> Item 8: Start small</h3> <p>When you're bringing proptest into a code base for the first time, it's tempting
to Specify All The Things. This is unfortunately a good way to fail. If you jump
into the deep end, you'll find that your proptests are mysteriously failing or
hanging in ways you can't explain. It's important to go at this incrementally as
you develop a feel for what kinds of generators your system needs, and what
kinds of properties you can feasibly verify.</p> <p>Start by proptesting your pure …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>During this global pandemic, online video calls have become essential to the way we work. Millions of workers are now accustomed to hopping on calls with their colleagues to hash things out that they would previously have done in person. Zoom has shown itself to be a reliable partner for video conferencing. However, as a company, Zoom has given <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">reasons to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users">avoid</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/876351501/zoom-acknowledges-it-suspended-activists-accounts-at-china-s-request">its software.</a></p>

<p>The world’s new reliance on video conferencing got me thinking: <em>How hard could it be to build a video conferencing web application?</em> Like most things worth doing, the answer was <em>difficult, but fun</em>.</p>

<p>When I first started researching for this project, I discovered that there isn’t much information out there about building a WebRTC-based application from start to finish. Mozilla’s WebRTC documentation is invaluable, but it lacked answers to some of the questions I had. And tutorials that exist generally only cover connecting two users in a fairly basic way. I wanted to do something more ambitious.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-going-to-build">What we’re going to build:</h2>

<p>In this article, we’re going to build a real-time video chat application with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will allow users to create video chat rooms with a unique slug, allowing any user to join.</li>
  <li>The app will keep track of which users are connected to the given room.</li>
  <li>The app will allow users to establish a group video call with eachother through WebRTC peer connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that sounds easy enough. Creating pages with central information on the fly in a web app is the bread and butter of any self-respecting web framework—and with Phoenix it’s a piece of cake. Tracking users seems a little tricky, but if you’ve heard of what LiveView and PubSub can do, you can probably guess that we’re still on the right track. WebRTC was designed for video calls, but group video calls? That might get complex. Plus, how would that even work if each of the connections is only peer-to-peer? We’ll get to that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://littlechat.app/">We’ve wrapped up the finished product and deployed it at littlechat.app</a>. Try creating a room and hopping on it with a friend or two. That’s what we’re going to create.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/littlelines/littlechat">You can also find the source code for this project here if you’re more of the self-guided type.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>I’m going to assume that you are comfortable working with Elixir and Phoenix. I’ll assume that you might have toyed around with LiveView a few times before this article, but it doesn’t take much to get up to speed. Finally, I’ll assume you have no WebRTC experience beyond having heard about it a few times.</p>

<p>We will be using the latest versions of Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView in this article, which are the following at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir 1.10.3</li>
  <li>Erlang 23.0.2</li>
  <li>Phoenix 1.5.3</li>
  <li>Phoenix LiveView 0.13.3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC</h3>

<p>Web Real Time Communication, or WebRTC for short, is a technology that allows real-time, peer-to-peer communication between users. It provides an API for handling user video, audio, and other data via peer-to-peer connections.</p>

<p>WebRTC has been around since 2011, but implementation by the various browsers has been uneven over the years. Nowadays, each browser has a more consistent WebRTC implementation, making browser support much better, but implementing it can still be a dance.</p>

<p>What makes WebRTC so flexible—and, at times, confounding—is that it has no standardized server-side implementation. WebRTC does not care how users in a video chat learn about each other and send their connection information, it only handles how to connect those users once their information has been sent. This originally confused me, as I was not sure where the server-side <em>signaling</em> (the WebRTC term for the process of telling two users about each other for a peer connection) ended and the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> began. We’ll dig into this later.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Elixir’s Phoenix framework allows us to build reliable and performant web applications built on Erlang’s rock-solid foundation. On any project, my first instinct these days is to reach for Phoenix. But the motivation goes deeper.</p>

<p>Elixir is built on Erlang’s VM, which was specifically developed for the challenges of the telecoms industry, where fault-tolerance and high-availability are essential. That sounds perfect for this project.</p>

<h3 id="liveview">LiveView</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> is one of my favorite components of Phoenix. It makes real-time user interaction between the client’s UI and the server seamless, without needing to write (much) JavaScript. LiveView makes real-time user interactions much easier to build and maintain, all while working within familiar concepts: Phoenix, Elixir, and OTP.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Have you got all your tools ready? Let’s go!</p>

<p>First, we’re going to create a new Phoenix project with LiveView already configured. If you’re trying to add video chat to an existing app without LiveView already configured, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html#content">LiveView is pretty easy to set up from scratch too.</a> We’re going to call our project Littlechat, a portmenteau of Littlelines and chat.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.new littlechat --live</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s <code>cd littlechat</code> into our brand new app and install its dependencies.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>littlechat
<span>$ </span>mix deps.get
<span>$ </span>npm install --prefix assets</code></pre></div>

<p>Standard stuff. Let’s go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-rooms">Creating the Rooms</h2>

<p>Users can’t connect to each other if they don’t have a place to meet, so let’s build them a room!</p>

<p>Let’s create a <em>context</em> called <code>Organizer</code> with a schema <code>Room</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.gen.context Organizer Room rooms title:string slug:string</code></pre></div>

<p>That generated a few files for us, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</code>, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer/room.ex</code>, and a migration file ending in <code>XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</code> Let’s start with our Room schema.</p>

<p>Our rooms will only have two data to start, <code>slug</code> and <code>title</code>, both strings. <code>slug</code> will be the unique identifier for the room, so we’ll need to add a unique index to the database to prevent collisions. Let’s set up the database:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># priv/repo/migrations/XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Repo.Migrations.CreateRooms</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto.Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>"rooms"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:slug</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:title</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>create</span> <span>unique_index</span><span>(</span><span>:rooms</span><span>,</span> <span>:slug</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For the schema, we’re going to create a basic changeset function with the added <code>unique_constraint</code> on slug. But we’re also going to add a private function, <code>format_slug/1</code> for the purpose of cleaning our slug input.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/room.ex</span>

<p>Great! Now we can create rooms in the database. What about getting one from the DB? Easy.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</span>

  <li><code>render/1</code> implements a LiveView callback with the given <code>assigns</code> (variables containing session data) and expects a <code>~L</code> sigil (Live EEx). I prefer my LEEx templates inline, but you’re welcome to create a file <code>lib/littlechat_web/live/room/new_live.html.leex</code> and get rid of this function if you prefer to keep your templates separate.</li>
  <li>Inside of this template, we create a basic form for creating a new Room. Note the reference to the <code>@changeset</code> assign.</li>
  <li>We then tell the form (via LiveView) to send the event <code>"validate"</code> to the server every time user input is added.</li>
  <li>Finally, we tell the form to send the event <code>"submit"</code>, along with the associated form data, to the server when the user makes a submit action (presses enter or clicks “Submit”).</li>
  <li><code>mount/3</code> is a key callback that makes the LiveView function. It contains three arguments, <code>par…</code></li></ul></section></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German government is preparing a massive investment plan to boost the development of local telecoms firms, in an effort to pivot away from dominant suppliers like China's Huawei.</p>



<p>The plan, dubbed the "joint proposal for action" by the ministries of interior, economy, research and transport, and seen by POLITICO, lays out how the government plans to spend €2 billion in funding from its larger coronavirus recovery stimulus program <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/konjunkturpaket-1757640" target="_blank">presented in June</a>.</p>



<p>"The prosperity and competitiveness of Germany and Europe will increasingly depend on mastering new communication technologies," the proposal said, adding that this would "require a common political and industrial commitment at national and European level." </p>



<p>The plan comes as European governments increasingly take steps to box out Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G-rollout plans due to security concerns. The restrictions mean telecoms operators have become more reliant on Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia, triggering calls from telecoms <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">operators</a> and some lawmakers to open up the supply chain to new players.</p>



<p>The German draft proposal includes over €300 million of investment in Open RAN technology, €237 million for a 6G research hub and €250 million to boost demand and expand 5G networks.</p>



<p>The draft also earmarked €550 million of German public investment in Europe's microchip market through a joint project, <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">announced Tuesday</a>, between the government, the EU and local industry players.</p>



<p>The draft proposal was <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/open-ran-geheimpapier-milliarden-fuer-neue-mobilfunktechnik-sollen-abhaengigkeit-von-huawei-verringern/26830274.html?ticket=ST-5932468-7f1AIvazemqcyVbktwbi-ap6" target="_blank">first reported by Handelsblatt</a>.</p>



<h3>Looking for new 5G</h3>



<p>The government wants to prioritize "open RAN" technologies throughout its telecoms investment plan, a concept that would chop up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and break the market power of large end-to-end vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>Ericsson and Nokia "for long have held a globally good position," the text said, but "China is however technological frontrunner in 5G mobile networks." </p>



<p>"Germany and Europe need to urgently strengthen their competences and develop industrial ecosystems for Open RAN and 6G technologies, including hardware and software," it said.</p>



<p>The adoption of Open RAN could mean a blow for Ericsson and Nokia, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">have benefited</a> from the pushback against Huawei. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/oran-reflow-huawei-europe-telecoms-5g/">the concept is heavily favored by telecoms operators</a>, who use the equipment and complain that they are too reliant on gear from the two European suppliers.</p>



<p>The plan seeks to facilitate "Germany's entry into technologies for Open RAN solutions," with hopes to establish new companies in niche markets like network integration and edge computing software.</p>



<p>These services and products are currently part of major contracts between operators and major vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. </p>



<p>Experts have warned that the Open RAN technology is still immature and it could take years for these new types of networks to function as well as conventional 5G systems.</p>



<p>But the concept has gained influence in countries including the U.S. and the U.K., where lawmakers sought ways to replace Huawei.</p>



<p>In the European Union, Germany so far has been among the most eager to promote the concept — which is also heavily favored by its telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom as it looks to exit its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/deutsche-telekom-huawei-us-security-measures/">dependency on Huawei equipment</a>.</p>



<h3>Microchip plan</h3>



<p>Also on Tuesday, the German government said it wants to boost the German and European semiconductor industry with new EU, German and private investments to boost chip manufacturing and design firms.</p>



<p>“We want Germany and Europe to become more sovereign and independent of imports when it comes to microelectronics and communication technologies," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, announcing the <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">government's plan</a> to launch a so-called Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), elected projects that are set up to allow EU and national public funding to help private companies develop new technologies like microchips.. </p>



<p>The global semiconductor supply chain is dominated by U.S., Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean firms. Europe lags far behind in the supply of high-end chips, though it has a handful of companies that champion supply-chain niches like chip-printing machines and chips for cars.</p>



<p>The German call to launch an IPCEI project comes in the wake of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/computer-chip-shortage-disrupts-global-car-production/a-56224486" target="_blank">warnings by its car industry</a> last month that a chip shortage was disrupting its production.</p>



<p>The European Commission is also working on a strategy to catch up on chips. It <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572339">launched discussions</a> with Europe’s leading firms in a bid to launch an “alliance” of firms, institutes and national governments to pool investments and set up joint projects this spring, including a manufacturing plant for high-end chips.</p>



<p><em>This article was updated to reflect that Important Projects of Common European Interest are approved under EU state aid rules.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We are going to be creating a product landing page which will utilize 3D models and particle effects to take product showcasing to a whole new level. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the concepts of working with a 3D environment in the browser, while using modern tooling, to create your own highly performant 3D sites.</p><p>The final project can be viewed at <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://3d-product-page.netlify.app/">3d-product-page.netlify.app/</a></span></p><p>And the final code can be viewed at <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/molebox/3d-product-page">github.com/molebox/3d-product-page</a></span></p><p>This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>React</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>CSS</li><li>The command line</li></ul><p>What tools are we using?</p><p>Snowpack</p><p>We are going to be using <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">snowpack</a></span> as our build tool. Its a modern tool that is similar to Webpack, but takes a slightly different approach. Instead of bundling our entire application and recompiling on every code change and save, snowpack only rebuilds single files where the changes have been made. This results in a very fast development process. The term used by the snowpack team is <strong>unbundled development</strong> where individual files are loaded to the browser during development with ESM syntax.</p><p>Chakra-ui</p><p>Our application will be written in React and use <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra-ui</a></span> for styling. Chakra is an accessibility first component library which comes with superb defaults and enables us to build accessible, modular components at speed. Think of styled components with easy theming and composability.</p><p>Threejs and react-three-fiber</p><p>We will be utilizing Threejs by way of a wonderful React library called <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">react-three-fiber</a></span>, which allows us to easily interact with Three using common React techniques. The library is a renderer for Three, using it we can skip a lot of mundane work such as scene creation and concentrate on composing our components in a declarative way with props and states.</p><p>The renderer allows us to use all of the Three classes, objects and properties as elements in our markup. All classes constructors arguments can be accessed via an <code>args</code> prop. A simple mesh with a box class can be seen below. Don't worry if you don't understand what this means, we will go over everything shortly.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>mesh</span><span> </span><span>visible</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>rotation</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>boxGeometry</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>geometry</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>meshStandardMaterial</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>material</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>mesh</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>MDX</p><p>Our page will be rendered in <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a></span>, a format which allows us to write JSX and include React components in markdown files. It's a wonderful development experience and one I hope you will fall in love with once we reach the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Install the fun</p><p>I have created a handy snowpack template that creates a project with snowpack, chakra and MDX all installed. It also comes with React Router v6 but we wont be using that so will remove that boilerplate.</p><p>Open a new terminal and navigate to your desired project folder and run the following which will create our new project. Change <code>my-new-app</code> to your apps name.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npx create-snowpack-app my-new-app --template snowpack-mdx-chakra</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Next we can install our projects dependencies.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npm</span><span> i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-three-fiber three @react-three/drei react-particles-js</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Now that we have our dependencies installed we can begin to tear out some of the stuff we wont need. Our landing page will encompass a single page so we can open the <code>mdx-routes.js</code> file and remove the <code>Nav</code> component and the page-two route from the <code>MDXRoutes</code> component. We'll return to this file later to add some styling but for now we can move on.</p><p>Inside the pages folder delete page-two and remove the contents from page-one. Inside the components folder delete the emoji component and add a new folder called 3d. And that's it, we are now ready to begin coding some sick 3D landing page goodness!</p><p>The layout</p><p>Open the <code>mdx-layout.js</code> file located in the components folder. This will wrap our whole app, in our case our one landing page. Our page will consist of a css grid, we'll use grid areas to get a nice visual representation of how our page will layout. Remove what is currently in there and add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Flex</span><span>,</span><span> Grid </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> desktop </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>'edge   .       .         .'</span></p><p><span>'edge   text    product   .'</span></p><p><span></span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MDXLayout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Grid</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateColumns</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr 10%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateRows</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateAreas</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>desktop</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>bg</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.background</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100vh</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Grid</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> MDXLayout</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Using Chakras Grid component we set the amount of columns to have a responsive padding of 10% of the viewport width on each side of two flexible one fractional units of space. This basically means that the meat of our page will live in the two fractional columns, with each taking up as much space as they need before they hit the 10% padding on each side. Our rows follow the same logic except we save 10% for our header row and the rest takes up as much space as needed. As you can see, we have a background color set on the bg (background) prop. But where does that value come from and what does it mean?</p><p>Open the <code>theme.js</code> file located in the <code>src</code> folder. This is our global theme for our app. We are importing the default theme from Chakra, which itself uses the Tailwind default preset. We are then overriding the colors with our own brand colors. The font sizes are also being overridden to allow us to use slightly different sizes to the default. Go ahead and copy the following colors object into the file instead of the current one.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>colors: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>..</span><span>.theme.colors,</span></p><p><span>    brand: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      red: </span><span>'#ed1c24'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      lightGrey: </span><span>'#D6D6D6'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      background: </span><span>'#090d12'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      text: </span><span>'#FFFfff'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Components in MDX</p><p>MDX is just markdown that you can write JSX in. So that means that we can write normal markdown like so:</p><pre></pre><p>But we can also add to that React components We can even compose React components right in the MDX file! Let's open up the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and check out how we can add components to our MDX file without using imports.</p><p>Let's break down what's going on in here. If we scroll to the bottom we can see an <code>MDXProvider</code> wrapping our app. It accepts a components prop into which we have passed a components object declared above. The components object allows us to map React components to markdown elements as well as passing in custom components for use in our MDX files. As you can see, this template has set this all up for us by mapping some basic markdown elements to some Chakra components. Where there is no object key we have passed in a custom component which can be used in the MDX file without importing it as you would in a normal js or jsx file.</p><p>MDX accepts a special key called <code>wrapper</code> which will wrap the entire file with whatever is passed to it. In our case it will take our previously created layout component along with it's grid and use that to wrap our MDX file. Now that we know where the components are coming from when using them in our MDX file, let's go ahead and write some React in markdown!</p><p>The header</p><p>Opening up the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file located in the pages folder, add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span> </span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>edge</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>gridRow</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>align</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>ml</span><span>=</span><span>{6}</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>header</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Image</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/nike-logo/Blc12i-red-nike-logo-clipart-png-photos.png</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>alt</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>Red Nike Swoosh Logo</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>We are using the Flex component provided to us from Chakra via the <code>MDXProvider</code>. This component allows us to quickly apply flex box props to the base element, a div. Even though the component is based upon a div we can give it semantic meaning by utilizing the <code>as</code> props and setting it the header. If we check our layout file again and look at our grid areas we can see that we have <code>edge</code> on the first and second rows. So we have set the grid area to edge and the row to 1.</p><p>This places our component in the top left hand corner of the page. We have given it a margin-left (ml) so that it doesn't hit the edge. As you can see from the code block above, we are inserting an image. If you navigate to <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.transparentpng.com/search.php?q=nike">this</a></span> url you will see that it's a Nike swish (swoosh, tick?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SREs are responsible for evaluating tools that can help reduce toil on their teams and make their applications more reliable for end-users. There are a lot of SRE tools out there, and it can be hard to know which ones are the most important to consider. We’ve compiled this guide to highlight the key categories of SRE tools and help you find the right fit for your team.</p><h2>Monitoring tools</h2><p>Monitoring tools are used to generate valuable metrics and insights about an application and help SREs do everything from creating benchmarks to debugging outages. Luckily, there are monitoring tools for practically anything you might want to measure relating to your application. These tools usually cover one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Application performance monitoring (APM)</strong>: Models the response times perceived by end users of your application and compares this against performance benchmarks to detect latency and outages.</li><li><strong>Network monitoring</strong>: Examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic routed through your network to help with load balancing, debug client/server issues, and stop network attacks like DOS attacks before they occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resource / infrastructure monitoring: </strong>Looks at the consumption rates and SLOs for the components of your application, like the CPU load for your Kubernetes clusters, to help with resource management.</li></ul><h3>What to look for in a monitoring tool</h3><p>No matter what type of monitoring tool you’re looking at, you’ll want to investigate the following important features:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alerts: </strong>The tool should be able to generate alerts when metrics approach and exceed the thresholds that your SRE team identifies.</li><li><strong>Automated incident response: </strong>Ideally, your tools will also try to automatically fix any detected issues where possible, helping reduce your engineering overhead.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Logging: </strong>Your monitoring tool should create detailed logs that contain all the information you would need to debug an issue, with configurable highlighting for easier consumption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visualizations and dashboards: </strong>Monitoring tools offer various kinds of graphics and charts to help you interpret the data at a glance or communicate with your stakeholders. Depending on your use cases, you might want to look for tools that support certain types of data round-ups and visual representations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported integrations: </strong>Your tool should work seamlessly with your application components and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common monitoring tools</h3><p>Here are some of the monitoring tools that we hear about often from SREs:&nbsp;</p><h4>Open-source tools</h4><p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>: A popular monitoring tool with an active community and broad range of features.</p><p><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>: Helps you make dashboards and visualizations by integrating with other monitoring tools (often combined with Prometheus).&nbsp;</p><h4>Tools you can purchase</h4><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">AppDynamics</a>: A platform focusing on APM (though it also offers network and resource monitoring).</p><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">DataDog</a>: Offers a suite of monitoring tools to cover many different use cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&amp;utm_term=splunk&amp;_bk=splunk&amp;_bt=386199173970&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=43997962767&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgVfR2eqnx8gp6gDbtDTiPEVAcjJaAjRnT_mHhy8nUGRst6ycdQC_RBoCwmkQAvD_BwE">Splunk</a>: A generalized tool for managing large-scale data and deriving actionable insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>On-call management tools</h2><p>SREs and engineers are often responsible for being on call during working and non-working hours, prepared to react immediately to resolve any issue that might threaten the system’s health. Being on call can be stressful, and you want to be careful not to burn out your team. Fortunately, there are many tools SREs can use to help reduce the burden and make being on-call a bit less painful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an on-call management tool</h3><p>While most on-call tools also help your team manage the incident itself, we’ll be covering incident management in the next section. Here are some on-call rotation specific features to help you prioritize your assessment:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scheduling on-call rotations</strong>: Your tool should help you distribute the on-call duty equally and fairly across your team, with flexibility in case someone needs to trade on-call rotations at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sharing on-call calendars</strong>: Sometimes an issue touches multiple components, and several on-call engineers need to be involved in the incident response. For that reason, it’s important that your tool provides a centralized way to view the on-call calendars across your organization.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alerting on-call engineers: </strong>This one is pretty obvious, but it’s absolutely essential. Your on-call tool needs to integrate with your monitoring tools to deliver alerts, and it must provide a payload with enough context so that the on-call engineer can address the issue. Your tool should also give you rules-based configurations for alert routing and controls to combat spammy alerts, which lead to burnout.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common tools for on-call management</h3><p>Popular on-call management tools include <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Splunk OnCall</a> (formerly VictorOps), and Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Opsgenie</a>.</p><h2>Incident management tools</h2><p>Inevitably, failures will occur in your system, and the person on-call is going to need powerful tools to help fix issues in the moment and make sure that they don’t happen again. According to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/" target="_blank">Google’s SRE Book</a>, managing an incident successfully comes down to three things: (1) clear escalation paths, (2) well-defined response procedures, and (3) a blameless post-mortem culture. SREs can find tools to codify these practices and help your team communicate better and resolve incidents faster.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an incident management tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Issue triage: </strong>Your tool should help you configure issue types and severity levels so that you know how to prioritize and when to escalate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Escalation pathways: </strong>Whether issues are manually or automatically escalated, you should be able to quickly get the right people involved and easily share all of the context they need to understand the issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Runbooks / workflows: </strong>Depending on the issue classification, your tool should hand over the runbook of predefined steps the on-call engineers need to follow. Your tool should also be able to automatically execute workflows if certain conditions are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Real-time communication: </strong>Your tool should integrate with the apps your team uses to communicate, like Slack, Jira, or even Zoom, to share information automatically and free you up to focus on the issue at hand. It should also create a historical document of the incident response that your team can refer to later on.</li><li><strong>Data-driven issue analysis: </strong>Ideally, your tool will give you all the data you need to understand what happened and focus on how it can be avoided next time, instead of placing blame on individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common incident management tools</h3><p>All of the on-call management tools previously mentioned also feature some form of incident management. Additional dedicated tools for this purpose include <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">Blameless</a>, <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a>, and Netflix’s open source crisis management tool, <a href="http://blameless.com/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Configuration/Automation tools</h2><p>A main function of the SRE role is to automate away the mindless and busywork tasks of software development. Automated configurations can be used to ensure that toil is reduced and the same steps are always repeated when provisioning, managing, and destroying resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an configuration tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Infrastructure as code: </strong>This paradigm means that your infrastructure specifications live in a file, which can be run to recreate your configuration in the event of an outage. Most automation tools will have their own language for declaring the desired configuration.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Execution planning: </strong>Your tool should offer a preview of the effects of your changes before you run the automation, to make sure there are no unanticipated consequences.</li><li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> The tool should allow you to enforce steps that are always followed when performing a task, like deploying an application, and let you run these workflows automatically.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supports container orchestration: </strong>If you use a container orchestration service like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy your services, your configuration tool should be compatible.</li></ul><h3>Common configuration tools</h3><p>Popular tools for automating your infrastructure configurations are <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Microservice catalog tools</h2><p>To make sure that incidents are avoided in the first place, SRE teams should look for tools that help them enforce high-level policies and best practices. A key tenet of microservice catalog tools should be governance over your service oriented architecture. Governance refers to <em>what </em>rules and processes the team follows, as well as <em>who </em>is responsible for reliability across different services and applications. This helps avoid tribal knowledge, and is especially important when teams work remotely and manage many different microservices.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in a microservice catalog tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Supports a production readiness review (PRR): </strong>A key process for SREs is a PRR: stepping through a predefined checklist to make sure that the software is ready to deploy. This might include things like ensuring that you’ve set up load balancing and end-to-end testing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Transparent ownership: </strong>This tool should create a catalog of services with their owners clearly identified, so it’s easy to look up who is responsible for what.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Integrates with your </strong><a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/list/integrations" target="_blank"><strong>existing tools</strong></a><strong>: </strong>All the best practices you’re trying to enforce should be visible within one tool. This means, for example, that your APM set-up and on-call rotations should appear alongside the catalog of your services, so you don’t have to refer to multiple tools to know where to find important data.</li><li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>When your configurations or policies change, you shouldn’t need to make manual edits in the tool.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common microservice catalog tools</h3><p>The most common governance tool we’ve seen is unfortunately a giant spreadsheet (or, worse, several spreadsheets!). Since this is the opposite of the SRE philosophy, we’ve created Cortex to fill the gap. Our <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5f727be73405af82f83b0972_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-28%20at%205.01.49%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>microservice catalog</strong></a><strong> </strong>makes it easy to see your services and owners in one place, and we foster accountability and show you how to improve using a gamified <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5ecc28b2e9133b2ab44992a2_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-25%20at%201.20.53%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>scorecard</strong></a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the right tools, your SRE team will be able to spend their energies improving your product’s reliability and performance instead of dealing with toil and overhead. We hope this …</p></div></div>

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>

<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>

<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>

<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>

<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>

<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>

<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The main processor is an Intel 8080.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>

<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<p><span>Y</span>esterday, I got into a verbal altercation at Starbucks.</p>
<p><span>An older man, talking very loudly, said something along the lines of “My son is golden because he has a degree from Stanford University.”</span></p>
<p><span>This comment really infuriated me because this type of outdated thinking—that a college degree from an elite, pricey university means you’re set for life—must die immediately. It falsely </span><b>signals</b><span> to employers that you’re better than the average Jane just because you have a piece of paper. In reality,</span><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <span>all it really signals is your family’s socioeconomic status</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>So I interjected and said, “Let me guess… You paid for your son’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I did,” he said. “My son’s grandfather was Herbert Hoover, and my son’s degree is like gold.”</span></p>
<p><span>[Eye roll]</span></p>
<p><span>I preceded to tell him that it doesn’t matter if you have a college degree anymore to do today’s jobs and that he was basically bragging about his family’s socioeconomic status, not his son’s actual achievements. I tried to elaborate about the inequalities of higher education and why it’s an outdated metric of future success. I explained why employers are absolutely wrong for thinking his son is better than someone without a degree or a degree from a public university.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he told me to go fly a kite, because that’s usually what happens when people are wrong and have zero evidence that their stance is right and yours is wrong. (I’m always open to new ideas, SO LONG AS you present trustworthy facts, stats, and research.)</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, this man is an out-of-touch elitist, and I stand by everything I said to him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/stanford-university"><b>Fun fact</b></a><b>: The median family income of a student from Stanford is $167,500, and 66% come from the top 20%.

<p><span>Stanford is far from an anomaly, according to</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html"> <span>New York Times</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<h2><span id="Degree_requirements_lead_to_less_diversity"></span><b>Degree requirements lead to less diversity</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Recruiters use software, known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which I discuss in detail in a </span><a href="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/"><span>previous article</span></a><span>. ATS collect, sort, and filter job applicants who apply through an online form.</span></p>
<p><span>They use this tool because the average job post receives 250 applications today, and they need a way to save time filtering down candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, online application forms will feature “knockout questions,” like “Where did you graduate from?” “What year did you graduate?” and “What did you major in?” These are meant to automatically weed out candidates who don’t meet certain criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, if I—a college dropout—were to apply to a job with these knockout questions, I’d automatically be filtered to the rejection pile, with not one human actually taking the time to even scan my resume. All because I don’t have a Bachelor’s degree, despite my 10 years of professional, proven experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if application forms don’t feature knockout questions, recruiters are likely inputting “keywords” into their ATS, searching for words like, “Bachelor’s,” “Harvard,” etc., just to quickly filter down the amount of resumes they have to review.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me be clear: Filtering candidates by degree is the epitome of wrong and legally,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>it’s actually discriminatory</span></a><span>, which could be a massive liability for companies requiring a Bachelor’s degree or higher to even be considered for employment.</span></p>
<p><span>This sounds like crazy fake news, but according to an article on the reputable legal encyclopedia,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>NOLO</span></a><span>, I’m right.</span></p>
<p><span>In the post, a reader asks if requiring a college degree for employment is illegal:</span></p>
<div>
<p><b>I work for a large nonprofit employer whose mission is to help inner-city children finish high school and go on to college.</b></p>
<p><span>We do fundraising, provide tutors and coaches, work with teachers and parents, and help school districts come up with strategies and resources to reduce dropout rates, among many other things. Our employees do everything from sending out mailings and answering phones to lobbying Congress to helping kids with their math homework and college applications.*</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the Board decided to require all new employees to have a college degree. </span><b>The Board feels that it would be great for the kids and their families we work with to see the benefits of staying in school; the Board has also said that having employees who never finished high school or college runs counter to the message we’re trying to send about the importance of education.</b></p>
<p><span>I can see their point, but I’m concerned that this requirement might screen out large numbers of applicants of color. Is it legal for us to adopt this hiring requirement?*</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>*Side-note:</b><span> Why are so many entities STILL preaching college as the only way to get a job and succeed in life, when 50% of grads are underemployed or unemployed today? See chart below.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/what-happened-to-the-promise-of-a-4-year-college-degree.aspx"><b><img title="06 credentialism more grads higher unemployment" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-1024x829.png" alt="Chart: As more people enroll in college, the unemployment rate among new college graduates has risen." width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-1024x829.png 1024w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-300x243.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-768x622.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-770x623.png 770w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></b></a></p>
<p><b>NOLO’s answer:</b></p>
<div>
<p><span>Whether or not a hiring requirement is discriminatory depends on its intent and its effect. Some employers adopt screening tests or criteria with the purpose of screening out certain applicants. For example, imposing a strength test would have the effect of screening out larger numbers of women. If an employer’s intent is to discriminate, and its hiring criteria are simply a smokescreen for this true purpose, then the employer is discriminating. </span><b>But even if an employer has no intent to discriminate, its hiring criteria may have that effect.</b><span> If a selection test or requirement has a disproportionate effect on applicants in a particular protected category, that might be illegal discrimination. </span><b>The key is whether the requirement is truly necessary to do the job.</b><span> For example, a strength test might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants, but might also be necessary for a job as a firefighter, construction worker, or logger.</span></p>
<p><b>An employer whose screening test or requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</b><span> This is intended to be a difficult hurdle, but not an impossible one. For example, an attorney needs to pass the bar exam to practice law, so requiring applicants for an associate position at a law firm to be admitted to the bar would meet this test. Similarly, </span><b>many skills tests</b><span> would pass legal muster, as long as the exam tested skills that truly were necessary to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements are more slippery, in part because it isn’t clear exactly what particular skills, aptitudes, or abilities a degree confers</b><span> (unless a particular degree is required for licensing, like a law degree or medical degree generally is). </span><b>And, degree requirements often do have a disparate impact against African American and Latino applicants.</b></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Your Board has expressed a nondiscriminatory reason for its new requirement. </span><b>But a court would look at whether it really is necessary to have a college degree to do every job at your company.</b> <b>The variety of jobs employees hold is going to be a major strike against the requirement: It seems pretty evident that someone can stuff envelopes, answer phones, manage databases, and do a wide variety of other work without a college degree.</b></p>
<p><span>And, </span><b>even if a court were to accept the employer’s “role model” argument for certain positions, an applicant could still win a discrimination lawsuit by showing that there are less discriminatory alternatives available.</b><span> For example, an employee might be an even more effective advocate for staying in school if he or she can share how difficult it has been to succeed without a degree. An employee who has dropped out might be better able to relate to the decisions facing at-risk kids and better able to help them make a different choice. </span><b>In short, if a degree requirement has the effect of screening out larger numbers of African American and Latino applicants, your employer will face a very difficult task in trying to justify the disparity.</b></p>
</div>
<p><span>That last sentence is key. Today, the hot topic in HR today is “diversity.” Diversity for women, for latinos, for African-Americans, etc. But these are actually vanity metrics at best (or total lies at worst) if the company requires a college degree for employment—whether or not they realize it.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements actually lead to less diversity.</b></p>
<p><b>The strongest predictor of entrance and completion of a degree at a top-tier university isn’t merit, but</b><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <b>family ability to pay</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<p><a href="http://pellinstitute.org/downloads/publications-Indicators_of_Higher_Education_Equity_in_the_US_2020_Historical_Trend_Report.pdf"><span><img title="07 credentialism bachelors degree attainment family income" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income.png" alt="Graph: Estimated bachelor's degree attainment by age 24 for dependent family members by family income quartile: 1970 to 2018" width="1200" height="990" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income.png 1200w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-300x248.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-1024x845.png 1024w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-768x634.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-770x635.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></a></p>
<p><span>So all your degree requirement really says to candidates is, “I discriminate based on your parents’ socioeconomic status.”</span></p>

			<p><strong>[INTERVIEW]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[00:01:31] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Hello, everybody. Thanks for tuning back in to The Secure Developer. Today, we’re going to have a DevOps-flavored episode here. I’m really happy to have with us James Turnbull, who is a VP of Engineering at Timber and also kind of a long time DevOps thought leader. He has been the chair of Velocity, has sort of been very much a core part of the DevOps journey, making him especially qualified to discuss a little bit about how it’s similar or different to the DevSecOps journey. James, thanks for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:01] James Turnbull:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:02] Guy Podjarny:</strong> James, before we dig into the topic of substance, tell us a little bit about what is it that you do and maybe your journey and how we touch security?</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:10] James Turnbull:</strong> Sure. I lead engineering product teams. At the moment, I’m working a product called Vector, which is an open source observability tool. I’ve been an engineer for about 25 years. I think it’s too many years to start citing that, and I started my career off largely in sort of enterprise, banking finance, as a security engineer and a security architect for a few years in a retail bank, I built perimeter systems and ATM networks and stuff like that. In the last 10 years or so, I’ve largely worked in high-growth startups. I was an early employee at Puppet, configuration management tool. I was an early employee at Docker obviously doing containerization. I was a CTO at Kickstarter and I have done similar sorts of roles over the last few years. As you said, I was the chair of the Velocity conference for a couple years and also I write technology books. I’ve written 11 books about engineering and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:00] Guy Podjarny:</strong> 11 books is impressive. I have a few under my belt but 11 books is definitely a notable number there.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:06] James Turnbull:</strong> No kids I think is probably an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:08] Guy Podjarny:</strong> It makes for some free time. So, I’m curious a little bit. Quite a few guests that came onto the show have gone into security from maybe the operations, and you actually were in security but then you moved outwards. Do you remember that transition, that decision point of whether you want to leave security and go to a role that doesn’t have security in the title?</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:29] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I was managing a CERT team, a Computer Emergency Response Team, at a retail bank, and one of the things I’ve been thinking about last three or four years before that was sort of large scale infrastructure management. One of the very frustrating things about being a security person in a large organization is you don’t control the infrastructure. You are largely dependent on infrastructure teams to provide you with information about vulnerabilities, about the state of the infrastructure. You’re largely reliant on them to do remediation for you. They would obviously come to me and say, “We don’t have any tools that allow us to mass maintain, mass patch all of these systems. We don’t use large-scale package management. We don’t have any configuration management tools.”</p>
<p>I sort of started to look in that area, about the same time I found Puppet. I started working on the open source Puppet tool. When they raised some money, I thought I can see the viability of this tool. I work in the environments where this is a desperate need. So, I came on board at Puppet to try and bring some of that experience, and I think I was probably our first pre-sales person, as well as being head of community and professional services, and a bunch of other things along the way. I tried to inject that flavor of this is what a large enterprise looks like. This is their experience. This is the empathy I have for their problems. The very first customer, I was involved in the New York Stock Exchange, customers that sort of flavor where my experience resonated.</p>
<p><strong>[00:04:47] Guy Podjarny:</strong> That’s a great story, and it’s interesting around this, taking ownership basically or being frustrated about not being able to control and address those issues. You very much scratched your own itch with the move to the solution itself in the world of Puppet. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>It’s actually interesting that Puppet, I think, recently, maybe in the last couple of years, have actually launched a remediation-focused solution that indeed focuses. It sounds maybe like on the same problem space that you’ve just been describing as [inaudible 00:05:15].</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:15] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I’ve had a couple of steps at it. [inaudible 00:05:17] was a product manager there for a while, originally built a sort of patch management, vulnerability management system like 2012 or 2013 but it proved to be – It’s a non-trivial problem to solve. But, yes, it’s definitely one of those areas where we have a lot of information about vulnerabilities. We have a lot more ability to interrogate hosts and work out what’s wrong. We still have the challenge of how do you remediate those in a safe and reliable way? How do you ensure that there’s no downtime?</p>
<p>I think those problems are the ones that Puppet is trying to work out, how do we solve? How do we take these feeds of data and turn them into actions or execution that organizations can undertake?</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:55] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah, very much. I mean, there’s also been some surrounding changes with the adoption of Kubernetes, as you pointed out, the ability to interrogate environments and ask for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s indeed maybe go down this path of the DevOps analogy and maybe a reverse path of your journey and talk a little bit about the analogies in the DevOps journey and in these changes of tools. Where is it that we can learn from them in security versus where do they defer and should be defined differently?</p>
<p>I thought maybe a helpful model for us to try and follow here is this people process technology type trial. Let’s start from that first one there, people. Maybe I’ll start by having you describe because people have different definitions of the people aspect of DevOps. When you think about people change is required to do DevOps successfully, how do you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:45] James Turnbull:</strong> I mean, I think the people aspect of DevOps to me is probably the most important aspect of it. My best interactions or my best successes in building things or working on things or operating things was because I had good relationships with the folks all part of the process, whether they be software engineers, DBAs, or security people, or audit risk people. It’s a relationship-driven process.</p>
<p>To me, the DevOps thing is really about building a bridge between folks who previously perhaps didn’t have a conversation. There wasn’t necessarily any antagonism there. It was literally like, I do a job. I build an artifact. I give that artifact to some other people. Those other people do something with it, and sometimes they come and tell me that it’s broken.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there’s a little bit of friction in there with regards to like the op side of things, get other people that live with the outage and so forth, but it’s really about like, okay, the Ops people have a set of expectations and constraints, and they have some needs. If they had a conversation with the people building the thing in the first place at first principles, would some of that process be smoother? Would the friction be reduced? Would the potential for outages be reduced?</p>
<p>To me, having a conversation, having a good relationship, understanding everybody’s needs is the key to that sort of DevOps thing. Obviously, there’s lots of tools and those bits and pieces in that automate a number of those processes and sort of reduce the human effort requirement, but it all stems from having that conversation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:12] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah. I very much relate to this but I guess maybe let me ask you, from a security change perspective. Now, when you think, okay, we’re going to do DevSecOps, and I’m using this buzzword fairly loosely over here, it’s just a simple way of saying embed security into the DevOps existence if you will, or processes, do you see the same? Do you also think really the most important piece is the people piece?</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:35] James Turnbull:</strong> I think so. I think there’s a couple of levels of this. When I started out in security, there was a generation or even a couple of generations before me who saw their role as saying no to things. They really saw themselves as guardians of the business and the enterprise. The easiest way to safeguard those organizations was to say, “No, we shouldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>I probably belong to the next generation that came along. I left security about the same time as this was becoming more sort of status quo, but a bunch of people who really said that our job is not to say no. Our job is to say present the risk, present options about how you might mediate the risk in some way, with a view to like allowing the business to do what it needs to do to make money in a fast and efficient and safest way possible. It’s their risk appetite and not our risk appetite. Our job is to explain to them the decisions they’re making and what the impact is, but it’s really their ownership. They own the business risk in a way that we don’t.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonates really strongly with me in this sort of DevOps sort of the world is ultimately the outcome is you want to move fast and ship things, right? You want to be able to take the time from code, not earning you any money on a developer’s desktop, to code running in production, and making your business money. One of the sort of caveats in there, one of the things in there, is you want to do that in a secure way, as well as an efficient set of ways. Security becomes another stakeholder in that DevOps life cycle, and their job is really to say, “Okay. We have policy or we have process, or we have information we need from you that bubbles up and allows us to do our jobs. If we give you that …</p></div></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLf9q36UsBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
        <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, February  1, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>It seems like everyone these days is developing in containers. Specifically, I mean running your local development environment almost entirely in containers. There's a lot to be said for it, especially when you're bringing new developers into a project: it can be an invaluable way for anyone new to the project to quickly get all the tooling set up with a lot fewer "works on my machine" issues. But everything involves tradeoffs, so today we're going to focus on what some of the drawbacks of containers are. Also because it's my blog, so I write about what I want, dammit, and containers have been bugging me a little lately!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have been bugging me, and that make me just want to run processes directly on my host.</p>
<p><strong>Installing and managing packages takes extra work.</strong> Using Python as an example, it's pretty easy to get packages installed for any project that's using a modern dependency manager like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>. You just run something like <code>poetry install</code> and it will setup a virtualenv for you (essential to have reproducible builds, isolated between projects). The tool is there, and you just use it, but you can wrap it in a Makefile for convenience if you like. But if you're using Docker, you get a lot of extra steps. For one, you have to make sure that the dependency manager's generated virtualenv is persisted on your host, not just in the container, else you will be reinstalling those dependencies every time you start a container. (Or you can install the dependencies into the <em>image</em>, but then you have to rebuild the entire image and install <em>every</em> dependency to just add one for testing something out, adding unnecessary friction.)</p>
<p><strong>Actually, everything takes extra commands.</strong> You want to install a new package? Oh, open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to compile your program? Open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to launch the development server? You guessed it... And yes, I know the pedantic comments are going to be "well, actually you can do this in one command with <code>docker run</code>"—okay, but that's not better: now you've just made the one command you need to run <em>far</em> longer.</p>
<p><strong>File permissions are a pain in the butt.</strong> If you have a directory mounted on the host and in the container (<code>node_modules</code>, for example) then in all likelihood the files created inside the container are going to be owned by <code>root</code> since everything runs as <code>root</code> by default. When you're your normal user outside the container, you now will have challenges doing things like deleting that directory—and it produces a lot of really noisy output when you use something like <code>grep</code>, because suddenly there are a lot of files you cannot read! There are solutions to this, making the container use the same userid as your user on the system, but I have not found anything that worked well. It's just not worth the effort, and you're left with a nuisance every time you generate files inside a container.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining history is difficult.</strong> Getting your bash history retained between containers is a challenge, but I understand it's doable. Now you use a Python shell, so you need to configure that one for history as well.  Then you start using Elixir, so you need to configure history for it as well. Everything that normally works out of the box when you're developing on your host directly? You have to configure it and figure out which files you need to share between containers and the host to make it work. You usually figure this out by the pain of <em>not</em> having the history, and eventually someone on the team will patch it to make it work (mostly). But... at what cost? You get this for free by just, you know, using the host.</p>
<p><strong>Performance is horrible on Macs.</strong> I use Linux as my only operating system (Ubuntu specifically), but many colleagues past and present prefer using Macs. With the latest hardware advances from Apple, this is going to hold true going forward. And yet the performance is tangibly worse for Docker on Macs, because you have to run it inside a VM. (Windows cleverly skirts this problem by running the Linux kernel directly, not inside a VM; Mac OS could certainly take a similar approach in the future, if they prioritize developer experience. I am not optimistic.)</p>
<p><strong>Integration with tooling isn't great.</strong> We've had a tough time at <a href="https://remesh.ai/">work</a> getting IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code to play nice with our containerized setup. They support containers, but they don't seem to support containerized monorepos very well. Or that's what I've seen from the problems my colleagues have run into. I've fiddled with it a bit. As a vim user, it doesn't affect me personally, but it is a big issue when considering the impact on the team at large.</p>
<p>So, yeah, containers are pretty great. I'm glad we have them, and I <em>love</em> having them for use in production environments. But locally? Most of the time, I think you're better off running what you're developing directly on your local machine. You get a robust, easy-to-use setup that doesn't throw away a lot of the features you get for free (history!). There are benefits to either approach, but the old tried-and-true methods deserve some love.</p>

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-03">Marc on 2021-02-03</h2>

<p>I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. </p>

<p>RSS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Really-Simple-Syndication</a>, is (or <em>was</em> depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.</p>

<p>Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the <em>curated</em> timeline). I've already spoken before about my <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html">general disinterest with Social Media</a> but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p>

<p>However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html">Deep Work</a> as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the <em>latest</em> items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…</p>

<p>Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.</p>

<p>As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss">Reddit still offers RSS support</a> by appending <code>/.rss</code> to the end of a given URL.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.</p>

<p>Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding <a href="https://atthis.link/rss.xml">this blog</a> to your reader?</p>

<p>Calculating prime numbers in a range is another comparison in programming languages. In this article, we compared the speed of codes to find Prime Number functions in C++ and Python</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Prime numbers are an interesting area to research. A&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>prime number</strong></a>, it is also called&nbsp;<strong>prime</strong>&nbsp;shortly, is a natural number (a positive integer) greater than one that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. If a number is not prime then it is called a&nbsp;<strong>composed number</strong>. There are several mathematical questions regarding prime numbers that are still unsolved. Finding them and relations and their effects on some other functions, graphics really interesting in mathematical phenomena.</p>
<p>In the programming world today,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>&nbsp;is very popular and easy to use. It makes popular because of supports from big companies (i.e. Google) and its successful libraries and frameworks on AI Technology. It is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared with C/C++, Delphi, Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme, or Java. Python has very clear syntax and it has some practical things. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for other applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use. Python is free to use and more information can be found from their official web page&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
<p>C and C++ are the fastest and one of the most powerful programming languages and it is easy to calculate prime numbers as fast as possible. In these tests we will use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">C++ Builder</a>&nbsp;which has a great IDE, includes compilers for Win32, Win64, Android, and iOS. C++Builder has both CLANG Enhanced C/C++ Compiler and Embarcadero’s new Bcc C/C++ Compiler. It also features a modern, high-productivity RAD Studio IDE, debugger tools, and enterprise connectivity to accelerate cross-platform UI development. You can develop GUI based applications easily, as it comes with the award-winning VCL framework for high-performance native Windows apps and the powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform UIs. There is a free C++ Builder Community Edition that can be used by students, beginners, and startups with limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the free C++ Builder Community Edition here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter</a>. Professional developers can use the Professional, Architect, or Enterprise versions of C++ Builder.

<p>Python can be used inside Delphi projects and this prime number function is tested before in Delphi and in Python here&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM</a>&nbsp;with Kiriakos Vlahos. Here, we were inspired by this video and we try to do the same tests on the same function in C++. Finding Prime Numbers in C++ is explained in detailed well in this&nbsp;<strong>Easily Learn To Find Prime Numbers In Modern C++</strong>&nbsp;post&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/easily-learn-to-find-prime-numbers-in-modern-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we compared the speed of Prime Number functions in C++ Builder 10.4 and Python 3.9.1.</p>

<p>In these counting prime numbers tests we also found that Python 3.9.1 version looks faster than 3.7.9 version which comes with current Spyder editor. It is obvious that 64bits test doubles 32bits test in speed.</p>
<p>We also tested counting prime numbers with same procedures in C++ Builder with system information in <a href="https://learncplusplus.org/interesting-c-builder-compiler-counting-prime-number-benchmarks/">our post here</a> before. Here are some of results.</p>

<p>These tables above show that calculating the number of prime numbers in 32bits takes 0.494 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 8.770 seconds In this test, in comparison C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>17.8 times faster in 32bits</strong>&nbsp;and calculating number of prime numbers in 64bits takes 0.350 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 3.298 seconds that means C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>9.4 times faster in 64bits</strong>. Note that we made the same tests before with&nbsp;<strong>GNUC/C++</strong>&nbsp;on the same system and we post it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/quickly-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-gnu-c-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-visual-studio-code-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>VSCode</strong>&nbsp;before, and we did the same tests on the latest Dev-C++ and results can be found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/dev-c-tutorial-easily-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. All C++ tests are runs with about the same scores in different compilers on the same system given above.</p>
<p>We also found that Python 3.7.9 comes with Spyder is slower than 3.9.1 in our tests. Here is a table in comparison with C++ Builder below.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the same PC System, our tests show that C++ ( C++ Builder BCC &amp; CLANG, GNU C/C++, Dev C++, VS Code) is about 9.4 times faster than Python on counting prime numbers in 64 bits and about 17.8 times faster in 32 bits. The calculating number of prime numbers is good to use some basic logical operations and mathematical functions. The procedure includes logical if() clauses, for() loops, some mathematical procedures (floor, sqrt etc.), that show C++ is very fast in mathematical operations. These kinds of tests can be done in different operations to compare languages.</p>
<p>Note that all tests were done on a single core/thread test. C++ Builder is capable to do Threads and easy to use Parallel algorithms for multi-thread operations. It shows that threaded tests are much faster, depends on the number of cores/threads.</p>
<p>Actually, results were obvious because of Python is an interpreted programming language with some benefits while C/C++ is a non-interpreted (compiled) programing language. Here C++ proofs that still it is very fast to do mathematical operations in comparison with Python. These kinds of tests can be done on many mathematical operations and on other codes. Speed changes may improve analyzes and other operations (i.e face detection, image processing, or other AI technologies). If your applications are built with C++ they will have faster operations in each task. On the other side, Python has some advantages in coding, easy to code, well on AI technologies with some TensorFlow, Keras frameworks. Users should define their priorities before coding an application and they should choose their programming language for their projects.</p>
<p>Please keep following our next posts on these tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="comp-kknyjvzi" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Recently I was asked this question and it got me thinking. This article is still an ongoing piece of work so any comments and suggestions are welcome.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>I have worked in the last 10 years as an iOS native developer. I’ve had to manage my own memory in Objective-C with [retain] and [release] and got to work with Swift 5 and Autolayout. I also dipped my toes into Android, React Native, Ionic and have previously worked with C++, .net, J2ME and others.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hence from my experience these are some types of companies that would benefit from doing things all native (iOS, Android or both):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Companies that already started with native apps a long time before and already have a significant codebase in native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies for whom money is not a problem, but quality and performance is very important. They want the best there is and have no problem paying for that. Usually these are already large companies with a lot of sales and that have an important brand to protect. Ex: Banks, Automotive, Telecoms, Airlines, Electronics etc..</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Companies that require a project that heavily uses some features close to the operating system. Examples: heavy use of video, or graphics, some types of games, fitness trackers or other apps that make constant use of sensors and run in the background. They also need to be the first that take advantage of a new feature in the OS.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Companies that require a large and complex project. If you have a project with a complex UI and with many features. &nbsp;Often these are companies that already have a cross-platform project but it has become so large that it is getting difficult to maintain and might already have performance issues that are causing a bad user experience. They already are paying for a team of developers to maintain the app so there won’t be much of an economy if switching to native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Companies whose core service is through an app. Examples: Uber, Revolut, etc.. These are companies who cannot risk the app being broken or taken offline because of a change in the framework they are using. Moreover they require the app to work flawlessly, and be so good as to be featured in the AppStore or Google Play. Being in the top 5 apps is almost a requirement. Therefore it’s better to use the native tools that are guaranteed to be supported and that allow for a great user experience.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. For startups that need an MVP I would recommend starting with a native app in only one platform Android or iOS, whichever is closer to their potential customers. After you test it in the real world and have gone through several iterations of build+validation and started to have traction and funding, you can now invest in a second app for the other platform, having the advantage that you already have the first. Going native will allow you to iterate faster because the development process is making use of better tools and better support. Otherwise if you would start with a cross-platform solution you will find at some point that it doesn’t scale, or it has become too buggy and unstable to support different UIs (iPhone, iPad, Android, watch etc) from one codebase and that you will be forced to rebuild native anyway.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What companies would NOT benefit from native app development vs cross-platform apps?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; 1. Companies that already have a working mobile website and want to reuse a lot of that code then it’s probably better to go cross-platform.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies that have a lot of programmers and know-how in a certain technology ( ex: Javascript, Microsoft technologies) and wish to leverage that. If you have many people with experience in .net, you might want to try Xamarin. Likewise if you have many people with experience in React or other Javascript frameworks, you might want to try React Native or Ionic. This still means you occasionally will need to find someone who can work with native but those can be outside consultants and most of the codebase can be maintained by using the know-how inside the company.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Internal apps that must work on many platforms and UI smoothness and beauty is not a concern, but resources in terms of people and time are.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you need to make an app that you don’t think will be maintained. Examples are apps for conferences or promotional campaigns that will only be used for a period of time and are afterwards useless, apps for conducting studies or surveys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you have an app that should look the same way across all platforms disregarding UI guidelines. Examples: Many games are like that, made in Unity or other frameworks and have their own look and feel which is platform independent.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Frequent issues with cross-platform solutions:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Memory issues when scaling the app.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Animations and “snappiness”. Animations will not be automatically supported and actually more difficult to implement in cross-platform solutions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Lack of proper tools — Often, there is no debugger and no performance measurement tools.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Uncertainty of whether that platform will still be supported in a few years. There have been cases of cross-platform tools that were either abandoned (Flash) or acquired and then axed (Parse). Even so, generally there seems to be a trend of people liking the newest cross-platform tools</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A tendency to prefer the "new and trending" tools</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div><div id="comp-kko39lkc" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-dont-use-cross-platform-mobile-dev-tools-ac57ddc582b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Too small community. Programmers need other programmers to learn from or use their open-source code. If there aren’t many others then you will be stuck fixing some obscure bug or having to build something from scratch for that particular platform.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You still need access to native developers. Some parts will still have to be made native and often bugs will have to be fixed in the bridging platform. In RN there is a frequent issue of using open-source libraries that are not maintained or are buggy and some work still needs to be made on the native part to keep them up-to-date.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Many companies that started with cross-platform tools have ultimately abandoned them: Facebook, <span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></span>, <span><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a></span>, etc..&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Delayed access to having the latest and greatest of what features the OS can provide. New features released on Android and iOS must be adapted in order to be available using cross-platform libraries. This means there will be an unknown delay between their official release and being able to use them in your code.</span></p>

					<p>The laser scanning microscope is a special light microscope which uses a focused laser beam to scans the sample. The scanning of the laser across the sample is done by driving the laser in x and y direction.&nbsp; The image is composed in the software by combining the measured light points.</p>
<p>The DVD Laser Scanner Microscope is build from two DVD pick-up heads. The laser of the DVD head is used to illuminate the sample at a tiny spot, focused with the DVD heads own focusing mechanism. The deviation of the laser is done by the pick-up heads lens moving coils.</p>

<h6>Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</h6>
<p>A special case is the confocal laser scanning microscopy that enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from sets of images obtained at different depths. Confocal laser scanning microscopes are often used in combination with fluorescence to study properties of biological samples such as cells.</p>

<h6>Image Resolution</h6>
<p>The resolution of the image is defined by the number of measurements taken in x direction and the number of lines in y. The maximum resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the system’s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser as in conventional optical microscopes. In fluorescence observations, the resolution is often limited by the strength of the signal. More sensitive photo-detectors or increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser can compensate.</p>

<h6>Prototype Setup</h6>
<p>The first prototype set-up uses two pick-up head. One is emitting the laser and scanning in x direction. The second pick-up head carries the sample and moves in y direction. The photo-detector on the laser unit is removed and the signal is captured with a simple photo-diode. The coils are controlled by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino</a> with drive electronics and the images is rendered in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><div data-elementor-type="wp-post" data-elementor-id="9644" data-elementor-settings="[]"><div><div><section data-id="39453a45" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="28daaf9d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="6259e7" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>In this Elastisys Engineering blog post, we show how to set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Exoscale using kubespray and Terraform. It gets a control plane and a set of worker nodes, and leverages Rook and Ceph to get Persistent Volume support.</p><h2 id="why">Why install Kubernetes using kubespray?</h2><p>The reasons why one might want to install Kubernetes “manually” are many:</p><ul><li>Allows you to run Kubernetes on cloud providers even if they do not offer a managed Kubernetes service such as AKS, EKS, or GKE.</li><li>Not entangled with the cloud provider’s IAM or other services, which makes a multi-cloud strategy easier to implement in practice. This way, your tools and processes will not be cloud-vendor specific.</li><li>Allows full control over the control plane: if you want to install, e.g., an OpenID Connect provider such as Dex to integrate with your Identity Provider (IdP), you can. With a managed service, what you can or cannot do is at the mercy of your cloud provider.</li></ul><p>So let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Our cluster setup is as following:</p><ul><li>One control plane node: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB local storage.</li><li>Three worker nodes: 8GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 100GB local storage each.</li></ul><p>All nodes are running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The cluster is running Kubernetes v1.19.7 and is installed using kubespray 2.15.0. You will also need Terraform to follow along with this guide.</p><h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2><p>The first thing that is needed is to set up all the infrastructure needed for the cluster.</p><h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3><p>The easiest way to deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster is to use the Terraform script from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a></p><p>Clone kubespray for the script. Exoscale support is on master right now.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
cd kubespray<br></code></pre><p>Create a new folder in the inventory folder for your cluster.</p><pre><code>CLUSTER=my-exoscale-cluster
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/$CLUSTER
cp contrib/terraform/exoscale/default.tfvars inventory/$CLUSTER/
cd inventory/$CLUSTER</code></pre><p>Edit <code>default.tfvars</code> and make sure that <code>ceph_partition_size</code> for all the workers is set to 50. <em>(To match the reference setup)</em></p><p>For authentication you can use a encrypted credentials file ~/.cloudstack.ini or ./cloudstack.ini. This file can be created by running:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; cloudstack.ini
[cloudstack]
key = 
secret = 
EOF
sops --encrypt --in-place --pgp  cloudstack.ini
sops cloudstack.ini</code></pre><p>Insert your API key in <code>key</code> and API secret in <code>secret</code>. Follow the <a href="https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoscale IAM Quick-start</a> to learn how to generate API keys.</p><p>To create the cluster, run the following and follow the instructions on the screen.</p><pre><code>terraform init ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale
sops exec-file -no-fifo cloudstack.ini 'CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG={} terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale'</code></pre><p>You should now have a inventory file <code>inventory.ini</code> that you can use with kubespray. To test it and to make sure that all the nodes are properly up and running, run the following:</p><pre><code>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all</code></pre><h3 id="other-setup">Other setup</h3><p>If you are setting up the nodes by yourself, please keep in mind that Exoscale at the time of writing doesn’t have support for adding additional disks. Therefore you need to split the root disk into multiple partitions.</p><p>This can be achieved by making sure that your instance has more than 50GB of disk and that the following lines is added to your user-data before booting.</p><pre><code>#cloud-config
bootcmd:
- [ cloud-init-per, once, move-second-header, sgdisk, --move-second-header, /dev/vda ]
- [ cloud-init-per, once, create-ceph-part, parted, --script, /dev/vda, 'mkpart 2 50GB -1' ] # Create ceph partition spanning from 50GB from start to end</code></pre><p>More information about this can be found in this blog post, <a href="https://elastisys.com/elastisys-engineering-how-to-set-up-rook-with-ceph-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook Ceph on Kubernetes</a>.</p><h3 id="kubespray">kubespray</h3><p>When the infrastructure is up and running, it’s time to add Kubernetes on top of all this. If you have followed the suggested way of spinning up the infrastructure, you should be able to run:</p><pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../cluster.yml -b -v</code></pre><p><em>NOTE: You might want to set the value <code>kubeconfig_localhost</code> in the file <code>group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml</code> to <code>true</code> to get the kubeconfig file. Just remember that it will use the private IP of the server, so update the server IP to match the IP of the control plane load balancer.</em></p><p>When Ansible is finished, verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster by running:</p><pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre><h3 id="rook">Rook</h3><p>Install rook by installing the rook operator chart.</p><pre><code>helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release
kubectl create namespace rook-ceph
helm upgrade --install --namespace rook-ceph rook-ceph rook-release/rook-ceph --version v1.5.5 --wait

<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>

<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

<p><strong>See also: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1616925913">Flash cards (Anki deck) for memorization</a></strong></p>
<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>

<p>For practice, you might try interpreting the following string:</p>

<h3 id="sgr">SGR</h3>
<p>The SGR (“Select Graphics Rendition”) function (<code>m</code>) has a much more complex signature than the other functions. An—again, abridged—guide to SGR arguments:</p>

</table>
<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7. Stop finishing Projects</strong></p><p><em>Biggest loss</em></p><p>I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!

<p>
<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, it’s success is also the reason why its closed approach has become so onerous. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: RDSInstance
metadata:
  name: example-rds
spec:
  forProvider:
    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.medium

</code></pre>
<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

I think optimisation is generally great, but has common pitfalls, and it’s important to be aware of these and avoid them. To balance this, this post goes well with my posts on </em><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-9-what-it-means-to-optimise"><em>the dangers of naive optimisation</em></a><em> (and what to do about this), and </em><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/38-slack"><em>on the importance of leaving yourself Slack and spare capacity</em></a><em>, rather than trying to optimise every last moment of your life. See the Afterword for more thoughts)</em></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The 80/20 rule, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> is a “rule” in economics, saying that 80% of the value comes from 20% of the effort. It is weird to call this a rule, when it’s such a fuzzy, ill-defined statement. And it’s easy to come up with counter-examples. But this is an empirical observation about the world, and in my experience it tends to be true. </p><p>And I think this is an <em>incredibly </em>valuable idea - far more so than it seems at first glance. This is a <em>key </em>part of my worldview, and how I live my life. And I consider it an important underlying factor in ways I’ve been successful. The key insight is this: <strong>there is always a clever hack</strong>. The world is not fair. Effort is not distributed as it should be. And this isn’t because people are dumb, or not trying. <strong>This is the default state of the world</strong>. Allocating your effort efficiently is <em>hard</em> - if it wasn’t, then the Pareto Principle would not hold. And <strong>this is the default state of the world for <em>you</em></strong>.</p><p>My underlying model here is that we spend <strong>most of our lives stuck in bad local optima</strong>. We have a set of default actions, standard ways of doing things and solving problems we come across. And these are <em>way </em>better than nothing, but nowhere near optimal. So to get <em>out </em>of a local optima, you need to develop the skill of <strong>noticing </strong>when you’re in one, being <strong>creative </strong>to find a better way, and <strong>implementing </strong>that to move to a better one. In practice, this insight gets stored in my mind as a <em>conviction </em>that there is a clever hack, an efficient solution. I have a strong aesthetic preference against things that feel slow, effortful, or inefficient. </p><p>And <em>solving </em>this is not obvious, nor easy! You need to be creative. Sometimes I can’t find anything better, and do <em>even worse </em>than the naive solution. And you’ll never find a truly optimal solution because the world is complex and everything is uncertain - my new toolkit just gets me to other local optima. And it’s possible to feel overwhelmed by this, and dissatisfied with anything short of perfect. But this is something I find it easy to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-11-live-a-life-you-feel-excited-about">be excited about</a> - there is a core part of me that is always <em>striving</em>. Focused on progress, not on the end point. <strong>The world is full of inefficiency and wasted motion, but <em>you </em>can do better</strong>. </p><p>Note that I’m making a far broader claim than the Principle obviously implies. It just says that there is a lot of value left on the table, which most people miss. I assert that you<em> can </em>find it, with sufficient effort and skill. And this is an empirical claim about the world, not something you can logic your way into. It’s something I feel very convinced of, because it works for me. And my goal in this post is going to be to outline some of the common ways this manifests, what the mindset feels like from the inside, and ways this can go wrong.</p><p>This is the key insight underlying a lot of my previous posts - find ways that the default state of the world is wasted motion, and overcome them:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/the-value-of-experiments">Run experiments and try new things</a>, appreciate the value of information.

Cultivate the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/become-a-person-who-actually-does-things">identity of Doing Things</a>, overcome the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-15-the-illusion-of-doing-nothing">illusion of doing nothing</a> and learn how to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-21-taking-the-first-step">take the first step</a></p></li><li><p>Notice when you’re being helpless about problems in your life, and remind yourself that <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-7-problems-are-for-fixing">problems are for fixing</a> </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">Social skills</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-14-minds-should-make-sense">Empathy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-18-how-to-teach-things-well">Teaching</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-10-seek-positive-externalities">Being a nice person</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-11-live-a-life-you-feel-excited-about">Intrinsic motivation</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-13-beliefs-are-for-true-things">True beliefs</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>If you want to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-8-what-altruism-means-to-me">improve the <em>world</em></a>, learn to overcome the wasted motion there</p></li></ul><p>Learning</p><p>One very salient case of this for me is learning, especially maths. The key insight is that <strong>learning is a process of information compression</strong>. </p><p>Maths is often taught as a stream of rigorous, formal information. You see a long stream of unmotivated, incomprehensible proofs, and are expected to study these in detail and remember them. But at the end of the day, I do <em>not </em>care about remembering a proof. I care about building <em>intuitions</em>. Concepts, and ideas, and motivation. A big picture framework in my head, from which I can <em>generate </em>the important parts of a course. </p><p><strong>80% of every proof is garbage</strong> - it’s a series of mindless algebra, and doing the obvious thing. When my goal is to <em>learn</em>, I want to find that 20% that is <em>insightful</em>, the steps that I would struggle to come up with myself</p><p>In practice, this manifests as a conviction that everything can be distilled down to key ideas and insights, and an impatience with implementation details. And sometimes the implementation details <em>are </em>important! It’s good to learn them a bit, and be able to generate them. But I find that most of the time, this conviction lets me cut past all the irrelevant crap, and find what actually matters. </p><p>Some tips: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Every time you encounter an idea, ask why do I care about this idea? </p></li><li><p>Seek the big picture understanding - focus on concepts not details</p></li><li><p>If something feels hard, ask “is this important?” And if not, move on, or ask for help - you’ll spend 80% of your time chasing the 20% of the hardest details - check it’s worth your time first.</p></li><li><p>Every time you see a proof, compress it into as few bullet points as possible. </p></li><li><p>Whenever you solve a hard problem, ask yourself “what do I know now, such that this problem should feel <em>easy </em>next time” - those are the key lessons the problem have to teach you</p></li><li><p>Write notes in a <a href="https://dynalist.io/d/ToOhEKlz9qC2PmpjgyTpXQJz">format that forces you to brevity and clarity</a>, because it’s easy to fall into the trap of just copying down everything - to avoid wasted motion, you need to identify what <em>matters</em>. Learning is a process of information compression.</p></li></ul><p>The underlying point here is that my goal isn’t to be able to regurgitate proofs, it’s to achieve <em>mastery</em>. And mastery does not feel like having every detail memorised, it feels like getting to the point where I don’t <em>need </em>to have every detail memorised, because I know which details matter, which can be looked up later, and which can be safely forgotten about. And by having this impulse to impatience, and striving towards efficiency, I can get to mastery <em>far </em>faster.</p><p>And I’ve found that these skills transfer pretty well to other fields! Not universally - I’d be a pretty awful doctor for example - but I’ve found that all fields that have caught my interest (major selection bias) have underlying concepts and <em>important </em>ideas. That it’s useful to have this sense of impatience, and this desire for efficiency and a big picture view in my mind. That by remembering to <em>prioritise </em>I can learn far better.</p><p>I outline my views on all this in more detail in my post on <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-18-how-to-teach-things-well">teaching</a>, and I outline my thoughts on learning concepts from conversation <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">here</a>. A further bit of empirical data for this belief is that I think it makes me a substantially better teacher, and get feedback to this effect.</p><p>Be results focused</p><p>One key source of wasted motion is a failure to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/be-deliberate">be deliberate</a>. And this makes sense! <strong>The default state of the world is wasted motion</strong>. This means that there is a constant fight against entropy, if you want to be focused and efficient. And keeping your eye on your true goal, is the key first step to finding the right path, out of the many options you have. So the first key skill is to be <strong>results-focused</strong> - be grounded, and be ever focused on what you’re aiming for.</p><p>And you don’t always get to know what you’re true goal is! And being overconfident about this is also a failure mode! But even if you’re confused about your true goals, you should always have <em>something </em>you’re aiming at - even if it’s just to learn more and become less confused.</p><p>Cut out the bullshit</p><p>And something often worth trying, if you notice barriers between you and your goal, yet can’t see good justifications behind the barriers, is to see what happens if you try skipping past them. This will <em>not </em>always work, and <strong>beware downside risk </strong>if you try this, but I’ve found it works far more than it has any right to. </p><p>One approach where I’ve had a lot of success with this centre on social things:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If I want to become friends with somebody, and have interesting conversations about something meaningful, I <em>can</em>. You don’t have to be stuck in dull small talk - if you’re both interested in having a better conversation, try <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">asking about the things you find genuinely exciting</a></p></li><li><p>If you’re having an argument with a friend - skip past all of the petty bullshit and remember that you’re on the same team. Clearly communicate your preferences, listen to their’s, and try to work together for the mutually best solution</p></li><li><p>If I want to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-10-seek-positive-externalities">be a nicer person</a>, and improve the lives of those around me, I <em>can</em>. If I want to give people meaningful compliments more often, I <em>can</em>. And this feels kinda weird, but works.</p></li><li><p>If I don’t understand how somebody thinks, and this is a source of tension, I can just ask, and be curious, and <em>try </em>to understand them until their <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-14-minds-should-make-sense">mind makes sense</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Health warning</strong>: These are all actions that violate social norms, which different people have different comfort levels with. I’ve found I tend to surround myself with friends where this works well - this won’t necessarily generalise.  But I personally have found this approach makes me a <em>lot </em>happier, and works for me.</p></li></ul><p>The underlying lesson here: To break out of the default local optima, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

        <p>These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.</p>
<p>You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.</p>
<h3 id="effective-python:-90-specific-ways-to-write-better-python">Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python</h3><p>If you're a Python developer wanting to improve your craft you should
read this. Good Python starts with a deep understanding of the
standard library and language.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance-browser-networking">High Performance Browser Networking</h3><p>If your code is triggered by a desktop or mobile browser you should
read this. It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile
networks, browser network protocols, and fundementals of networking.</p>
<h3 id="designing-data-intensive-applications">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h3><p>If your databases and APIs are a bottleneck you should read this. A
solid introduction to distributed computing, data transfer, indexing,
etc.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability-engineering:-how-google-runs-production-services">Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Services</h3><p>If you are responsible for services in production you should read
this. It's Google specific but is an excellent background on practices
for monitoring and maintaining production environments.</p>
<h3 id="that's-it!">That's it!</h3><p>Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>JavaScript the Good Parts</li>
<li>Design Patterns/Gang of Four</li>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
<li>A Philosophy of Software Design</li>
</ul>
<p>They're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the
investment of your time.</p>

		<p>To make it so that anyone with a web browser can code on Replit, our backend infrastructures runs on preemptible VMs. That means the computer running your code can shutdown at any time! We've made it really fast for repls to reconnect when that happens. Despite our best efforts, though, people had been seeing repls stuck connecting for a long time. After some profiling and digging into the Docker source code, we found and fixed the problem. Our session connection error rate dropped from 3% to under 0.5% and our 99th percentile session boot time dropped from 2 minutes to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>There were many different causes of stuck repls, varying from: unhealthy machines, race conditions that lead to deadlock, and slow container shutdowns. This post focuses how we fixed the last cause, slow container shutdowns. Slow container shutdowns affected nearly everyone using the platform and would cause a repl to be inaccesible for up to a minute.</p>
<h3 id="replit-architecture">Replit Architecture</h3>
<p>Before going in depth on fixing slow container shutdowns, you'll need some knowledge of Replit's architecture.</p>
<p>When you open a repl, the browser opens a websocket connection to a Docker container running on a preemptible VM. Each of the VMs run something we call <code>conman</code>, which is short for container manager.</p>
<p>We must ensure that there is only a single container per repl at anytime. The container is used to facilitate multiplayer features, so its important that every user in the repl connects to the same container.</p>
<p>When a machine that hosts these Docker containers shuts down, we have to wait for each container to be destroyed before they can be started again on some other machine. Since we use preemptible instances, this process happens frequently.</p>
<p>Below you can see the typical flow when trying to access a repl on a mid-shutdown instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/destroying-stuck-repls/simplified_arch.png" alt="Simplified diagram of repl.it conman architecture"></p>
<ol>
<li>A user opens their repl which opens the IDE and attempts to connect to the backend evaluation server via a WebSocket.</li>
<li>The request hits a load balancer which selects a conman instance to proxy to based on CPU usage.</li>
<li>A healthy, living conman gets the request. Conman notices that the request is for a container that is living on a different conman and proxies the request there.</li>
<li>Sadly this conman is shutting down and rejects the WebSocket connection!</li>
</ol>
<p>Requests will continue to fail until either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The docker container is shut down and the repl container entry in the global store is removed.</li>
<li>Conman finishes shutting down and is no longer accessible. In this case, the first conman will remove the old repl container entry and start a new container.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="slow-container-shutdowns">Slow Container Shutdowns</h3>
<p>Our preemptible VMs are given 30 seconds to cleanly shutdown before they are forcibly terminated. After some investigation, we found that we rarely finished shutting down within those 30 seconds. This prompted us to dig further and instrument the machine shutdown routine.</p>
<p>After adding some more logging and metrics around machine shutdowns, it became clear that calls to <code>docker kill</code> were taking much longer than expected. <code>docker kill</code> usually took a few milliseconds to kill a repl container during normal operation, but we spent 20+ seconds killing 100-200 containers at the same time during shutdown.</p>
<p>Docker offers two ways to stop a container: <code>docker stop</code> and <code>docker kill</code>. Docker stop sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to the container and gives it a grace period to gracefully shutdown. If the container doesn't shutdown within the grace period, the container is sent <code>SIGKILL</code>. We don't care about gracefully shutting down the container and would rather shut it down as quickly as possible. <code>docker kill</code> sends <code>SIGKILL</code> which should kill the container immediately. For some reason, the theory did not match reality, <code>docker kill</code> shouldn't be taking on the order of seconds to <code>SIGKILL</code> the container. There must be something else going on.</p>
<p>To dig into this, here is a script which will create 200 docker containers and time how long it takes to kill them at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash
</span>
COUNT=200
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting <span>$COUNT</span> containers..."</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> $(seq 1 <span>$COUNT</span>); <span>do</span>
    <span>printf</span> .
    docker run -d --name <span>test</span>-<span>$i</span> nginx &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
<span>done</span>

<span>echo</span> -e <span>"\nKilling <span>$COUNT</span> containers..."</span>
time $(docker <span>kill</span> $(docker container ls -a --filter <span>"name=test"</span> --format <span>"{{.ID}}"</span>) &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)

<span>echo</span> -e <span>"\nCleaning up..."</span>
docker rm $(docker container ls -a --filter <span>"name=test"</span> --format <span>"{{.ID}}"</span>) &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<p>Running this on the same kind of VM we run in production, a GCE n1-highmem-4 instance, yields:</p>
<pre><code>Starting 200 containers...
................................&lt;trimmed&gt;
Killing 200 containers...

real    0m37.732s
user    0m0.135s
sys     0m0.081s

Cleaning up...</code></pre><p>This confirmed our suspicions that something is going in inside the Docker runtime which causes shutdowns to be so slow. Time to dig into Docker itself...</p>
<p>Docker daemon has an option to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/#enable-debugging">enable debug logging</a>. These logs let us peak into what what's happening inside of dockerd and each entry has a timestamp so it might provide some insight into where all this time is being spent.</p>
<p>With debug logging enabled, let's rerun the script and look at dockerd's logs. This will output a lot of log messages since we are dealing with 200 container, so I've hand-selected portions of the logs that are of interest.</p>

<p>I started out by looking for the codepath that handles container kill requests. I added some extra log messages with timings of different spans and eventually I found out where all this time was being spent:</p>
<p><code>SIGKILL</code> is sent to the container and then before responding to the HTTP request, the engine waits for the container to no longer be running (<a href="https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/ab373df1125b6002603456fd7f554ef370389ad9/daemon/kill.go#L174">source</a>)</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;-container.Wait(context.Background(), containerpkg.WaitConditionNotRunning)</code></pre><p>The <code>container.Wait</code> function returns a channel which receives the exit code and any error from the container. Unfortunately, to get the exit code and error, a lock on the interal container struct must be acquired.

<pre><code>  ...

                exitCode: <span>-1</span>,
                err:      ctx.Err(),

						Computers are doing to communication<br>
						what fences did to pastures<br>
						and cars did to streets.</p><p>
						
						by Ivan Illich</p><p>
						
						
						
						
						Minna-san, gladly I accept the honour of addressing this forum on Science and Man. The theme that Mr. Tsuru proposes, "The Computer-Managed Society," sounds an alarm. Clearly you foresee that machines which ape people are tending to encroach on every aspect of people's lives, and that such machines force people to behave like machines. The new electronic devices do indeed have the power to force people to "communicate" with them and with each other on the terms of the machine. Whatever structurally does not fit the logic of machines is effectively filtered from a culture dominated by their use.</p><p>
						
						The machine-like behaviour of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation of their well-being and of their dignity which, for most people in the long run, becomes intolerable. Observations of the sickening effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent, narcissistic and apolitical. The political process breaks down, because people cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.</p><p>
						
						I congratulate Asahi Shimbun on its efforts to foster a new democratic consensus in Japan, by which your more than seven million readers become aware of the need to limit the encroachment of machines on the style of their own behaviour. It is important that precisely Japan initiate such action. Japan is looked upon as the capital of electronics; it would be marvellous if it became for the entire world the model of a new politics of self-limitation in the field of communication, which, in my opinion, is henceforth necessary if a people wants to remain self-governing.</p><p>
						
						Electronic management as a political issue can be approached in several ways. I propose, at the beginning of this public consultation, to approach the issue as one of political ecology. Ecology, during the last ten years, has acquired a new meaning. It is still the name for a branch of professional biology, but the term now increasingly serves as the label under which a broad, politically organized general public analyzes and influences technical decisions. I want to focus on the new electronic management devices as a technical change of the human environment which, to be benign, must remain under political (and not exclusively expert) control. I have chosen this focus for my introduction, because I thus continue my conversation with those three Japanese colleagues to whom I owe what I know about your country - Professors Yoshikazu Sakamoto, Joshiro Tamanoi and Jun Ui.</p><p>
						
						In the 13 minutes still left to me on this rostrum I will clarify a distinction that I consider fundamental to political ecology. I shall distinguish the environment as commons from the environment as resource. On our ability to make this particular distinction depends not only the construction of a sound theoretical ecology, but also - and more importantly - effective ecological jurisprudence Minna-san, how I wish, at this point, that I were a pupil trained by your Zen poet, the great Basho. Then perhaps in a bare 17 syllables I could express the distinction between the commons within which people's subsistence activities are embedded, and resources that serve for the economic production of those commodities on which modem survival depends. If I were a poet, perhaps I would make this distinction so beautifully and incisively that it would penetrate your hearts and remain unforgettable. Unfortunately I am not a Japanese poet. I must speak to you in English, a language that during the last 100 years has lost the ability to make this distinction, and - in addition - I must speak through translation. Only because I may count on the translating genius of Mr. Muramatsu do I dare to recover Old English meanings with a talk in Japan.</p><p>
						
						"Commons" is an Old English word. According to my Japanese friends, it is quite close to the meaning that iriai still has in Japanese "Commons," like iriai, is a word which, in preindustrial times, was used to designate certain aspects of the environment. People called commons those parts of the environment for which customary law exacted specific forms of community respect. People called commons that part of the environment which lay beyond their own thresholds and outside of their own possessions, to which, however, they had recognized claims of usage, not to produce commodities but to provide for the subsistence of their households. The customary law which humanized the environment by establishing the commons was usually unwritten. It was unwritten law not only because people did not care to write it down, but because what it protected was a reality much too complex to fit into paragraphs. The law of the commons regulates the right of way, the right to fish and to hunt, to graze, and to collect wood or medicinal plants in the forest.</p><p>
						
						An oak tree might be in the commons. Its shade, in summer, is reserved for the shepherd and his flock; its acorns are reserved for the pigs of the neighbouring peasants; its dry branches serve as fuel for the widows of the village; some of its fresh twigs in springtime are cut as ornaments for the church - and at sunset it might be the place for the village assembly. When people spoke about commons, iriai, they designated an aspect of the environment that was limited, that was necessary for the community's survival, that was necessary for different groups in different ways, but which, in a strictly economic sense, was not perceived as scarce.</p><p>
						
						When today, in Europe, with university students I use the term "commons" (in German Almende or Gemeinheit, in Italian gli usi civici) my listeners immediately think of the eighteenth century. They think of those pastures in England on which villagers each kept a few sheep, and they think of the "enclosure of the pastures" which transformed the grassland from commons into a resource on which commercial flocks could be raised. Primarily, however, my students think of the innovation of poverty which came with enclosure: of the absolute impoverishment of the peasants, who were driven from the land and into wage labour, and they think of the commercial enrichment of the lords.</p><p>
						
						In their immediate reaction, my students think of the rise of a new capitalist order. Facing that painful newness, they forget that enclosure also stands for something more basic. The enclosure of the commons inaugurates a new ecological order: Enclosure did not just physically transfer the control over grasslands from the peasants to the lord. Enclosure marked a radical change in the attitudes of society towards the environment. Before, in any juridical system, most of the environment had been considered as commons from which most people could draw most of their sustenance without needing to take recourse to the market. After enclosure, the environment became primarily a resource at the service of "enterprises" which, by organizing wage-labor, transformed nature into the goods and services on which the satisfaction of basic needs by consumers depends. This transformation is in the blind spot of political economy.</p><p>
						
						This change of attitudes can be illustrated better if we think about roads rather than about grasslands. What a difference there was between the new and the old parts of Mexico City only 20 years ago. In the old parts of the city the streets were true commons. Some people sat on the road to sell vegetables and charcoal. Others put their chairs on the road to drink coffee or tequila. Others held their meetings on the road to decide on the new headman for the neighbourhood or to determine the price of a donkey. Others drove their donkeys through the crowd, walking next to the heavily loaded beast of burden; others sat in the saddle. Children played in the gutter, and still people walking could use the road to get from one place to another.</p><p>
						
						Such roads were not built for people. Like any true commons, the street itself was the result of people living there and making that space liveable. The dwellings that lined the roads were not private homes in the modern sense - garages for the overnight deposit of workers. The threshold still separated two living spaces, one intimate and one common. But neither homes in this intimate sense nor streets as commons survived economic development.</p><p>
						
						In the new sections of Mexico City, streets are no more for people. They are now roadways for automobiles, for buses, for taxis, cars, and trucks. People are barely tolerated on the streets unless they are on their way to a bus stop. If people now sat down or stopped on the street, they would become obstacles for traffic, and traffic would be dangerous to them. The road has been degraded from a commons to a simple resource for the circulation of vehicles. People can circulate no more on their own. Traffic has displaced their mobility. They can circulate only when they are strapped down and are moved. </p><p>
						
						The appropriation of the grassland by the lords was challenged, but the more fundamental transformation of grassland (or of roads) from commons to resource has happened, until recently, without being subjected to criticism. The appropriation of the environment by the few was clearly recognized as an intolerable abuse By contrast, the even more degrading transformation of people into members of an industrial labour force and into consumers was taken, until recently, for granted. For almost a hundred years the majority of political parties has challenged the accumulation of environmental resources in private hands. However, the issue was argued in terms of the private utilization of these resources, not the distinction of commons. Thus …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Regularly, I discover myself thinking <em>"wow, that's so simple I can build this in a weekend"</em>. My rational brain kicks in at some point: <em>"Waaaaiiit a second, if it's so simple, why am I not seeing this done a million times?"</em>. Here I usually start better scoping and either find the answer to my question.</p><p>Often, my developer mind insists on "it's actually just two API endpoints and then I could do this and that". And often this holds true for the core functionality. If some <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/">basic validation</a> gives a green light for working on it from a commercial perspective, I still need to consider the tech stack and marketing approach, as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/why-build-it-and-they-will-come-wont-work-anymore">building alone doesn't do it</a>.</p><p>I'm not super fixed on the approach, my main goal is usually to keep long term overhead low. Laravel is my go-to solution for anything backend-heavy, but its power comes at a complexity cost too. For two little API endpoints used in, for example, a browser extension is a bit of an overkill.</p><p>Function as a service sounds like a great step towards "just having a few API endpoints". AWS Lambda is the name everyone is having in mind here. But any gains from simplicity are eaten up by AWS complexity. If you are new to AWS (Lambda), it easily takes you double or more time to get it running as you spend building the little lean function in the first place. This doesn't go well with the plan to "just chuck this out over the weekend".</p><h2 id="enter%3A-faasd">Enter: faasd <a href="#enter%3A-faasd">#</a></h2><p>Function as a Service should be easy. Here comes <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/">faasd</a> into play. It's a self-hosted alternative to run functions. It allows you to run a simple copy &amp; paste installer script on your machine getting it up and running. It takes less than ten minutes to get to work. It's production-ready and helps to remove the learning curve involved with Kubernetes and co.</p><blockquote><p>faasd is a self-hosted alternative to AWS Lambda to run functions. Production-ready within minutes ⏲️</p></blockquote><p>Once you have deployed your faasd instance, it's a matter of one command to push your function into production. From there it's up to you what you like to build. I catch myself breaking up the structure of larger applications in functions. It builds the container, publishes, and deploys your function code ready-to-use in seconds. To run this you will need the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">FaaS CLI</a>. Again this is installed in under one minute thanks to copy and paste that just works.</p><p>Found a great library but it's written in the "wrong" language? Thanks to the flexibility, you can also jump between programming languages easily. I use a mix of nodejs, PHP, and Python by now.</p><blockquote><p>With functions you libraries aren't in the <em>wrong</em> language anymore.</p></blockquote><p>This helps to truly break up large applications into functional parts using the best tool for you.

Plus, the performance is much better than relying on Docker Hub.</p><p>I got it up and running on my <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/hetzner">Hetzner server</a> in a few minutes using some guides from <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/digitalocean">DigitalOcean</a>.</p><p>After spinning up your server, the steps break down to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">installing docker</a>,</li><li>setting up the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-private-docker-registry-on-ubuntu-18-04">container registry</a>, and</li><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04">securing nginx</a>.</li></ul><p>Another really interesting option is <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a>. It allows you to abstract the steps.</p><p>I should have also paid closer attention to the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/">OpenFaaS workshop</a> at the beginning.

For the most time, I leave these concerns out. It simply doesn't matter if my functions can scale to millions of users, as I don't have millions of users. Migrating to a more scalable approach such as <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud">OpenFaaS Cloud</a> should be very doable.</p><blockquote><p>Worry about scaling, when you get to scale.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>From each of our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experiences</a> starting out as introductory-level engineers at Box, to becoming first-time managers overseeing five-person teams, then directors overseeing 30-50, and ultimately VPs managing hundreds, we've experienced software engineering from every angle.</p>
<p>At every step of the way, we asked ourselves: "how do we know if we are bringing value as engineering leaders?" Effective leadership uniquely blends human qualities - influence, empathy, courage, and <strong>results</strong>. This latter quality always brings the question of productivity - how effective are you at producing results through enabling others?</p>
<p>Since the advent of the software industry, most engineering teams have seen productivity as a black box. Only recently have people even begun to build internal tools that optimize performance. Unfortunately, most of these tools measure the wrong metrics and are shockingly similar across companies. We even built some of these tools and made mistakes. Now, we'd like to share the way forward.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="engineering-effectiveness-is-behind-the-times">Engineering Effectiveness is Behind the TimesÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering teams are both the most expensive and most fundamental part of tech companies. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more companies become tech-enabled</a>, the importance of engineering will only increase. Yet today, a full three decades after the advent of the internet, most engineering departments still rely exclusively on qualitative signals of performance.</p>
<p><strong>The evolution of engineering effectiveness is paralleling the spirit of sales' recent transformation</strong>. In the early 2000s, sales was considered an art, so sales leaders could skate by on charisma alone. Today, with tools like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://www.clari.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clari</a>, and <a href="https://people.ai/get-demo/?utm_campaign=demorequest&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_term=se-goog-1089&amp;utm_content=demorequest&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxp-ABhALEiwAXm6Iye9qQZaeojCPMvXn73zi-TRqbT93l7waQz3_uSadhOtpXncm8OLtvBoClTkQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">People.ai</a>, sales has fully executed the transition toward scientific, metric-based leadership for analyzing and improving performance.</p>
<p>In the coming years, engineering will adopt a similar, data-driven mode of management. In making this transition, however, most engineering teams are making these mistakes:</p>
<h3 id="mistake-1-measuring-approximations-of-output">Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output</h3>
<p>In their haste to become more data-driven, many engineering leaders are measuring their team's performance based on metrics intended to approximate output. <strong>These metrics fail because they encourage engineers to game the system.</strong></p>
<p>If you measure a fixed metric like lines of code or number of tickets closed, your engineers will begin splitting code into more lines or breaking bug fixes into multiple tickets. Even sprint points, which attempt to convert engineering work into a standard unit, suffer from this pitfall: Some engineers will slow down after reaching their sprint points for the week while others will strategically inflate their tasks to be awarded additional points.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced engineers will recognize that this type of measurement is fake</strong>. While they may not be as influenced to "play the game," their morale will plummet and they will self-select out. By rewarding approximated metrics of output, you're encouraging engineers to increase them regardless of how they correlate with software development success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter which metrics you choose, abstract output approximations will distract engineers from their actual jobs, ultimately decreasing both your team's effectiveness and morale.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mistake-2-not-measuring-anything">Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything</h3>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum sit engineering leaders who avoid measurement entirely. Many of these leaders have heard about the dangers of measuring the wrong metrics and therefore <strong>ricochet to the other extreme</strong>. They may emphasize the artisanal and social dimensions of engineering, claiming "software engineering is too complex to measure."</p>
<p>Non-measurement can even be self-reinforcing, because it places the leader into the position of being "the good guy." Instead of being a metrics-obsessed big brother, the leader can be the <strong>friendly older brother exclusively focused on keeping their team happy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-measurement fails because it prioritizes politics over productivity.</strong> If you don't measure any metrics, your engineering leaders will simply justify failures, telling stories like "The customer didn't give us the right requirements" or "We were surprised by unexpected vacations." Software development is complex enough that something always goes wrong; if you don't measure any data, you're at the mercy of individual stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, your top performers will see through these political machinations and quit because your culture lacks accountability.</p>
<p>In the short term, non-measurement can have a positive effect on team morale but it destroys morale in the long-term, especially among high performers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-measure-blockers-at-the-team-level">The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team LevelÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Instead of measuring some approximation of engineering output, software teams should measure actual, observable metrics that directly correlate to effectiveness.</p>
<p>Productivity is a relationship between inputs and output. In software development, the inputs are a blend of factors--technical, individual, human, etc.--while the output should be functional software that creates value for customers. <strong>Productivity in engineering therefore naturally increases when you remove the blockers getting in the way of your team.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-you-should-measure-blockers">Why You Should Measure Blockers</h3>
<p>Even at the beginning of the software revolution, there existed the notion that engineers should be nurtured. Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/free-food-silicon-valley-tech-employees-apple-google-facebook-2018-7#google-has-so-much-free-food-employees-worry-about-gaining-the-google-15-4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">food</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-amazing-health-and-fitness-benefits-2019-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gyms</a>) that would remove blockers to their work. Empirical management practices over the last forty years have reinforced the importance of "<a href="https://www.axelos.com/news/blogs/january-2020/the-importance-of-servant-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leadership</a>" and "<a href="https://www.mugo.ca/Blog/The-most-important-web-project-management-skill-the-ability-to-unblock-others" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unblocking your team</a>," while <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/2020-state-of-devops-report/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent research</a> emphasizes the importance of optimized inputs and best practices.</p>
<p>For engineers, these inputs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of developer tools</li>
<li>Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focused <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maker time</a> (free from disruptive meetings)</li>
<li>Easy access to documentation</li>
<li>Psychological safety on the team</li>
<li>Work-life balance</li>
<li>Presence of other high-performersÂ&nbsp;</li>
<li>A fair system of rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>The blockers to these inputs already exist and can be quantified, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?</li>
<li>How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?</li>
<li>How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>How often are engineers required to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">context switch</a>, preventing <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deep work</a>?</li>
<li>How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals.</strong> Together, these quantified blockers allow engineering leaders to answer key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is preventing the engineers from building faster?</li>
<li>What issues are arising in real time?Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each engineering team is unique, so its blockers will be specific. It's not so simple as "more maker time is better." If your engineering team is new or temporarily misaligned on key goals, more meeting time might be the answer. What never changes is the need for measurement and well-considered, deliberate decisions.</p>
<p>Over the last year, COVID-19 has helped demonstrate the value of measuring blockers. For many leaders running newly remote teams, <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/remote-work-challenges-solutions/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new blockers have arisen</a> that would never have been noticed if managers were only focusing on the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-team-is-the-right-level-to-improve">Why "Team" is the Right Level to Improve</h3>
<p>Since software development requires complex interaction between team members, it would be inappropriate to assign individuals their own metrics: Some engineers are effective individual contributors while others enable their teammates to perform. Engineers also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/okay-nabs-funding-from-sequoia-to-build-performance-dashboards-for-engineering-managers/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hate being micromanaged</a>, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted.</p>
<p><strong>Just as a sports team wins or loses together, so too should the engineering team be treated as the fundamental unit of success.</strong></p>
<p>Approaching engineering at the team level also places the proper accountability on the manager. It raises helpful questions like "What behaviors, structures, and work habits are preventing us from succeeding?"</p>
<p>Looking at the team level also enables managers to catch blockers as they evolve. Small issues, for instance, may not be apparent when the company is young, but can evolve into 10,000 papercuts only apparent at the team level. If code reviews take days instead of hours, at first one engineer complains, then two, then three... and if you don't pay attention, years later the engineering culture is shot. By compiling these small quantifications and observing their trends, a manager can understand whether a report is one individual's experience or truly relevant to the overall performance of the team.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, if blockers follow a constant evolution (e.g. one person is often the canary in the coalmine), an engineering leader can map how the new blockers are likely to evolve and prioritize which should be solved first.</p>
<p>Just as an airplane pilot must monitor dozens of different metrics to keep the plane flying, so too would an engineering leader benefit from viewing their team's metrics to understand overall performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an optimal engineering dashboard, a leader would be able to assess the blockers that prevent the ultimate success of their team.Â&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>"Productivity" is an appropriate measure for someone making widgets at a factory: "How many products did you produce in an hour?"</p>
<p>Engineering should instead be about effectiveness: "How able is this engineer to effect positive impact?"</p>
<p>Looking forward, engineering effectiveness will have three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities. (Think<a href="https://www.scalyr.com/blog/distributed-tracing-important-2019/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> distributed tracing</a>, but for human activities.)</li>

<p>Onto the examples! Please note that each "What it should look like" only fixes the issue discussed, even if there are further code smells that should be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="1notusingstrictmode">1. Not using <code>strict</code> mode</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using a <code>tsconfig.json</code> without strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Just enable <code>strict</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Introducing stricter rules in an existing codebase takes time.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Stricter rules will make it easier to change code in the future, so the time spent on fixing the code is returned and then some when working on the repository in the future.</p>
<h2 id="2definingdefaultvalueswith">2. Defining default values with <code>||</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Falling back with <code>||</code> for optional values:</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date?: Date) {
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date || new Date()
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Use the new <code>??</code> operator, or, even better, define the fallback right at the parameter level.</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date: Date = new Date())
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>The <code>??</code> operator has just been introduced last year, and when using values in the middle of a long function it might be hard to set them already as parameter defaults.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p><code>??</code>, unlike <code>||</code>, falls back only for <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, not for all falsy values. Also, if your functions are so long that you cannot define defaults at the beginning, then splitting them might be a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="3usinganyastype">3. Using <code>any</code> as type</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using <code>any</code> for data when you are unsure about the structure.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: any = await response.json()
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>In almost every situation where you type something as <code>any</code>, you should type it as <code>unknown</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p><code>any</code> is convenient, as it basically disables all type-checks. Often, <code>any</code> is used even in official typings (e. g. <code>response.json()</code> from the example above is typed as <code>Promise&lt;any&gt;</code> by the TypeScript team).</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>It basically disables all type-checks. Anything that comes in via <code>any</code> will completely forego any type-checks. This leads to hard to catch bugs, as code will fail only when our assumptions about type structure are relevant to the runtime code.</p>
<h2 id="4valassometype">4. <code>val as SomeType</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Forcefully telling the compiler about a type that it cannot infer.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>That's what type guards are for.</p>
<pre><code>function isArrayOfProducts (obj: unknown): obj is Product[] {
  return Array.isArray(obj) &amp;&amp; obj.every(isProduct)
}

function isProduct (obj: unknown): obj is Product {
  return obj != null
    &amp;&amp; typeof (obj as Product).id === 'string'
}

async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  if (!isArrayOfProducts(products)) {
    throw new TypeError('Received malformed products API response')
  }
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When converting from JavaScript to TypeScript, the existing codebase often makes assumptions about types that cannot be deduced automatically by the TypeScript compiler. In these cases, throwing in a quick <code>as SomeOtherType</code> can speed up the conversion without having to loosen the settings in tsconfig.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Even if the assertion might be save right now, this might change when someone moves code around. The type guard will ensure that all checks are explicit.</p>
<h2 id="5asanyintests">5. <code>as any</code> in tests</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Creating incomplete stand-ins when writing tests.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user: User = {
    firstName: 'John'
  } as any
  
  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>If you need to mock data for your tests, move the mocking logic next to the thing you mock and make it reusable.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

class MockUser implements User {
  id = 'id'
  firstName = 'John'
  lastName = 'Doe'
  email = 'john@doe.com'
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user = new MockUser()

  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When writing tests in a codebase that doesn't have great test coverage yet, there are often complicated big data structures, but only parts of it are needed for the specific functionality under test. Not having to worry about the other properties is easier in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Foregoing the creation of a mock will bite us, latest when one of the properties changes and we need to change it in all tests instead of one central location. Also, there will be situations where the code under test relies on properties that we did not deem important before, and then all tests for that functionality need to be updated.</p>
<h2 id="6optionalproperties">6. Optional properties</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional that are sometimes there and sometimes not.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
  weightInKg?: number
  sizeInMb?: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly model which combinations exist and which don't.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
}

interface DigitalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'digital'
  sizeInMb: number
}

interface PhysicalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'physical'
  weightInKg: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional instead of splitting out types is easier and produces less code. It also requires a deeper understanding of the product being build and might limit usage of code if assumptions about the product change.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>The big benefit of type systems is that they can replace runtime checks with compile-time checks. With more explicit typing, it is possible to get compile-time checks for bugs that otherwise might have gotten unnoticed, e. g. by making sure that every <code>DigitalProduct</code> has a <code>sizeInMb</code>.</p>
<h2 id="7onelettergenerics">7. One letter generics</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Naming a generic with one letter</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;T&gt; (arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Giving a full descriptive type name.</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;Element&gt; (arr: Element[]): Element | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>This habit grew I guess because <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html">even the official docs use one-letter names</a>. It is also quicker to type and requires less thinking to press <code>T</code> instead of writing a full name.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Generic type variables are variables, like any other. We have abandoned the idea of describing the technicalities of variables in their names when IDEs started to just show us these technicalities. E. g. instead of <code>const strName = 'Daniel'</code> we now only write <code>const name = 'Daniel'</code>. Also, one letter variable names are generally frowned upon because it can be hard to decipher what they mean without looking at their declaration.</p>
<h2 id="8nonbooleanbooleanchecks">8. Non-boolean boolean checks</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Checking whether a value is defined by passing the value directly to an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Writing the check in short looks more succinct and allows us to avoid thinking about what we actually want to check.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Maybe we should think about what we actually want to check. The examples above for example handle the case of <code>countOfNewMessages</code> being <code>0</code> differently.</p>
<h2 id="9thebangbangoperator">9. The Bang Bang operator</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Converting a non-boolean value to boolean.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (!!countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>To some, understanding <code>!!</code> is like an initiation ritual to the world of JavaScript. It looks short and succinct, and if you are already used to it, then you know what it is about. It is a shortcut to convert any value to a boolean. Especially if, in a codebase, there is no clear semantic separation between falsy values like <code>nu…</code></p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p>The other day somebody on reddit asked the age-old question: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/la1mz5/a_simple_question/">why didn't F# have typeclasses or functors?</a></p><p>That's a long discussion, but while reading replies, somebody mentioned this cool litte <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus">F#+ library.</a></p><p>Over to GitHub we go!</p><p>Over the years, as I've written more and more solutions in F#, I've come across stuff I wanted to do where it seemed as if I were fighting the language too much. Stuff like common conversions with strings. Turns out a lot of other people have those issues also, so folks started collecting little goodies here and there. You're coding along, and suddenly you realize you want to make sure that string is all lower case. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a method to automatically do that, something like "foo".toLower()?</p><p>As most every coder knows, that's already don. It's in there. But it's not just that one little method. During regular coding you run across all kinds of stuff that hasn't been coded. Let's say you want to put hyphens in a string (why, I don't know)</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Extensions
    let allCapsString = "I LIKE HYPHENS!"
    printfn "Extensions to core types"
    printfn "Original"
    printfn "%s" allCapsString
    let stickSomeHyphensInThere =  String.intersperse '-'
    printfn "Fixed"
    printfn "%s" (stickSomeHyphensInThere allCapsString)
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's trivial stuff, but damn stuff like that gets old. And it's not just trivial stuff. Let's you've got a list and you're expecting only one element in it. Lots of business logic revolves around making sure you have one and only one thing. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    let singletonTestData1=[1]
    let singletonTestData2=[]
    // reuturns the value or throws an error
    let singletonRet1=List.exactlyOne singletonTestData1
    // returns the value or none
    let singletonRet2:Option&lt;int&gt;=
        Option.protect List.exactlyOne singletonTestData2
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's pretty nifty because you can make sure it's only one item (or throw an error), catch the error and deal with it later (not shown here), or bail out on any decision-making entirely and let somebody else worry about it, ie, use an option.</p><p>I imagine we could do the same with atLeastOne. In fact, I might code that up as a PR. That's also a very common business requirement.</p><p>And you can extend generics too. How many times have you written a function and wanted to use it later as an operator? That kinda thing is fairly common in C++, and you can certainly do it in NET, but many times to get it done it seems unnecessarily complicated. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
    // turn any function into an operator
    let smallerThan a b=a &lt; b
    // isSmaller = true
    let isSmaller = 10 &lt;/smallerThan/&gt; 20
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I'm not crazy about that syntax, but fooling around with it some, I can see where the FSharpPlus guys were coming from. There are some odd language issues at stake, and this looks like a good compromise. I think this works better than some of the other options.</p><p>Once again, none of this is rocket science. All along you could have made this happen in whatever .NET language you use. It's nice having it already in there. Thanks guys!</p><p>I saw this one and almost had a nerdgasm. Every now and then you'll have a string and want to convert it to bytes, perhaps for some low-level fun with bits. Ever try to do that from scratch? Wow, it's a pain. There are excellent reasons it's a pain: there's encoding, there's collation rules, the list goes on and on. Human languages are tough. But what about just a dang default? Try this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Generic operators
    // Whatever I've got, make it bytes
    let myBufferBytes =
        "This is something I need to do bit-level stuff with" |&gt; toBytes
        ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Because that's a type extension on a generic, that works with all types of stuff. Just throw whatever you've got to toBytes and move on.</p><p>You can do this on your own, but you'll kill precious development time (and focus) wading through docs. And if you only do it one or two times a year it'll be that same pain, over and over again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Need to splay out a bunch of processing and then sum when done?
    let res42 = map ((+) 21) (async {return 21})
    let myComputationallyHardAnswer = extract res42
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Here we've wrapped up some common threading stuff along with collection traversal.</p><p>Of course, it's all composable with all of the other tools you have.</p><p>In another post I'll do some of the other cool stuff, like all of the mondad things they have, &nbsp;but that really gets into the technical part of coding itself instead of the convenience provided here. For now, <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus">you should check it out</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png" alt="" srcset="https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 1000w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 1600w, https://danielbmarkham.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/2018-12-Daniel-Signature.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>    </div>

<p>Revolut customers in Europe received this email around 4.54PM CET.</p>
<h2>Trading Update for GME &amp; AMC</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi …,</p>
<p>From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: <strong>GME</strong>) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: <strong>AMC</strong>) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
<p>You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.</p>
<p>None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.</p>
<p>For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don’t want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
<p>When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.</p>
<p>The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.</p>
<p>This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>When will they be available again to buy?</h3>
<p>This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Team Revolut</p>

<p><strong>Capital at Risk</strong></p>
<p>The value of a stock may fall as well as rise and you may get back less than what you initially paid, and in some cases the stock may lose its entire value and you may lose your initial investment. This is not investment advice. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision.</p>

<p>Revolut is one of the most popular investing apps in Europe. Maybe it is not that well-known in US yet.</p>
<p>But, until recently, it was one of possible alternatives to Robinhood to buy $GME and $AMC stocks.<br>

<p>According to <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/02/02/revolut-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invezz</a>, you can still buy these stocks in:</p>

But what if you are not familiar with JavaScript? What if you are not a developer? Would you still be able to make sense of (and learn) React?</p><p>My answer is a firm YES. That's why I wrote this article: what is React exactly? Why is it so popular? What problems does React solve?</p><p>This article is an introduction to React for beginners. It's the first post you'd want to read before learning the specifics of React. I'll explain the core ideas of React in plain English (and doodles <span>🌴</span>). No JavaScript experience? No problem! As long as you have some basic HTML knowledge (e.g. the format of an HTML tag), you should be able to enjoy this article.</p><p>This is a bird's-eye view <span>🦅</span> but I'll also equip you with a

Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry! I'll show you some examples and explain these properties in details soon.</p><h3><a id="declarative-ui" href="#declarative-ui"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Declarative UI</a></h3><h4><a id="imperative-vs-declarative" href="#imperative-vs-declarative"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Imperative vs. declarative</a></h4><p>When directly working with the DOM API, we'd have to specify what element to change at the right time, in the right order. This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly. We draw many sketches and hand them to React in a big pile. React stacks these sketches together and flips them like a flipbook.

The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>.

This way, when somebody asks for portraits of Domo wearing a different hat, we don't have to talk to React again.

The UI built with React is <strong>reactive</strong> -- it appears that the DOM "reacts" to any changes to the underlying data. No need to track the data.

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.

		<p>
As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice.

The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I wanted to write a program that I could feed a bunch of novels and then produce similar text to the author’s writing.</p>
<p>One method of generating fake but familiar looking text is to use a Markov chain generator. There is a fantastic Python library for doing this called <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">jsvine/markovify</a> but I wanted to learn more about how it works under the hood so I implemented the algorithms from scratch!</p>
<p>Before we get to text generation, let’s start by generating some fake weather. Skip the following section if you’re familiar with Markov chains.</p>
<h2 id="fake-weather-generation"><a href="#fake-weather-generation" aria-label="fake weather generation permalink"></a>Fake Weather Generation</h2>
<p>I have some historical weather data from my town. The weather here is either sunny or rainy. When it’s sunny, there’s a good chance that it remains sunny the next day. It rarely rains but when it does it often rains for a few days.</p>
<p>Rather than using a naive probability (e.g. there’s an ~83% chance it is sunny vs. rainy on any given day) we’ll use a Markov chain to generate more realistic looking data. Our generated data will have streaks of weather which will more closely resemble real life patterns.</p>
<p>To be specific, if it’s sunny there’s a 10% chance it will be rainy the next day and a 90% chance it will stay sunny. If it’s rainy then there’s 50% chance it will be sunny the next day and a 50% chance it will stay rainy.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram of this two-state Markov process.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/e4ae284c37dcdeb9323b73b3637b6709/b6699/weather-markov-chain.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Instead of using weights to describe probability, let’s distribute the states in a list that we randomly pick from. I find that defining Markov chains like this (while far more computationally expensive) is easier to debug.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>weather_chain <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'sun'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'rain'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We consume this model by picking a random starting state and using the current state to choose randomly from the possible future states. We do this over and over to generate a sequence.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> random


weather <span>=</span> <span>[</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span>weather_chain<span>.</span>keys<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>

<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    weather<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span>weather_chain<span>[</span>weather<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example output, we can see that rainy days are ‘sticky’ as we would expect from the model. </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="fake-text-generation"><a href="#fake-text-generation" aria-label="fake text generation permalink"></a>Fake Text Generation</h2>
<p>Instead of having a predefined Markov chain like we saw in the previous section, let’s build one from real data. The full source code for this article and the text corpuses can be found at <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/markov-chain-generator">healeycodes/markov-chain-generator</a>.</p>
<p>The code excerpts assume that we’re generating fiction. So the source text must have capital letters at the start of sentences and full stops at the end of sentences. We can use these two markers to generate text chunks that have a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>In our weather example, the state size was one — to decide the next step in the sequence, we only considered one previous day of weather. When it comes to generating language, a state size of one sometimes isn’t big enough and the arrangement of words can be too random to be interesting. A state size of two is a good starting point. Going higher than two can produce text that is too similar to the original text corpus.</p>
<p>The following function builds a Markov chain in the same format as our weather example. It takes a source text and a state size and returns a dictionary where the keys are the current state and their values are a list of possible future states. The lists contain duplicates and this is how we handle the probabilities of future states.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>build_model</span><span>(</span>source<span>,</span> state_size<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>'''
    Given a corpus and a state size, build a Markov chain.

    <span>return</span> model</code></pre></div>
<p>Given a tiny source of <code>'An apple is very good. An orange is very bad.'</code> and a state size of <code>2</code> it will produce the following Markov chain. Since the source was so small there are only four possible complete sentences.</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"An apple"</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"is"</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"apple is"</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"very"</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"is very"</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"good."</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"bad."</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"very good."</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"An"</span>

  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"orange is"</span><span>:</span><span>[</span>
    <span>"very"</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The following function consumes the Markov chain model and generates some fake text for us. To achieve a minimum length, we keep generating until we hit the minimum length and then keep going until we reach a token that ends with a full stop. To find a correct starting point, we pick a random key (two words) where the first character is a capital letter.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>generate_text</span><span>(</span>model<span>,</span> state_size<span>,</span> min_length<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<p>Here are those four possible complete sentences from our previous Markov chain. These can be combined infinitely by our function.</p>

'An orange is very good.'
'An apple is very good.'</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now feed in large amounts of text from an author and generate fake writing! In fact, any corpus that uses sentences will work with our program. For example, here is the result of feeding in a few Wikipedia articles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cricket is more similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the latest hour of it; and lately, I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all the more remote islands. At around the field. One of Wollstonecraft’s most popular metaphors draw on military concepts: Disease is an early type of fiction that were quick to resort to violence. One of Wollstonecraft’s favorite arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s some Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count could recollect, it was never worth the trouble of the stranger. But, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of conference with the whole matter as a natural result of the river, and, plunging through a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all. I cannot enter into details just now: but it was found, on Sunday morning, that he was forced to allow, had ever suspected of existing in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever thought of this life and of cutting him off with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="further-resources"><a href="#further-resources" aria-label="further resources permalink"></a>Further Resources</h2>
<p>The sun/rain example was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains#A_simple_weather_model">Wikipedia</a>. Victor Powell’s article, <a href="https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">Markov Chains</a>, was also helpful for my initial understanding and is worth checking out for the interactive graphics alone.</p>
<p>Some of the articles about Markov chains are a little inaccessible to those without a maths background. However, there’s a Simple English version of Wikipedia. Many articles have an alternative page which you can find by replacing the <code>en</code> in the URL bar with <code>simple</code>. For example, the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">simple version</a> of the Markov chain page.</p>
<p>Daniel Shiffman also covered Markov chains in a Coding Challenge on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGFJ8vugIWA">The Coding Train</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Behaviours to avoid in a software architecture role]]>

<br/>
February 2, 2021 | https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work in architecture roles alongside experienced software/technical/solution architects. Through observing others and my own trial and error, I’ve learned a little bit about what <em>not</em> to do in these roles (because it’s often easier to reflect on what didn’t work rather than what did). Even though I lean towards the idea that everyone should be architecting the system rather than having architects solely responsible - I recognise that some organisations are far from that ideal, and it’s those folks I hope find this list helpful. So here it is, 7 behaviours to avoid if you’re in a software architecture role:</p>
<h2 id="1-dont-ignore-the-engineering-team">1. Don’t ignore the engineering team</h2>
<p>If you’re not “hands-on” with the engineering team either through writing or reviewing code or deep in the technical discussions, then the likelihood is you aren’t close enough to the problems and the individuals on the team. If you’re not feeling their pain, then you are probably lacking the empathy and understanding to provide effective guidance. If you find yourself in this position, I would consider beginning with one-on-ones and pairing with engineers as the quickest way to increase empathy and understanding. Then look to participate in feature kick-offs, technical design discussions and code reviews where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="2-dont-ignore-the-domain">2. Don’t ignore the domain</h2>
<p>It’s part of the role to become a domain expert. This knowledge can be used to act as an effective translator between business and engineering. That said, you’ll want to avoid being a communication bottleneck too, so it’s important to teach, translate and document domain context and business value for the engineering team. This is where techniques like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/value-stream-mapping">value-stream mapping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming">event storming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ntcoding/status/1342805885224177666">domain-driven design</a> can really help.</p>
<h2 id="3-dont-prescribe-or-mandate-architectures">3. Don’t prescribe or mandate architectures</h2>
<p>For the most part, our industry has moved past the notion that a system’s architecture is designed in isolation (or in an ivory tower) and handed-off to engineers to deliver. However, it definitely still happens. Software architecture and development should be inter-weaving activities, with feedback from one influencing the other. Keeping that feedback loop as short as possible will likely lead to better outcomes. So if you would like to design and create more resilient systems and your organisation tends to mandate or prescribe architectures; consider how you can best empower engineers to make sound architecture decisions instead. Working with the engineers to agree on a foundation of architectural principles and accepting that architecture is never done, it should evolve and change over time are good places to begin (see the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures">Building Evolutionary Architectures</a> book for more on this).</p>
<h2 id="4-dont-just-seek-architectural-consistency">4. Don’t just seek architectural consistency</h2>
<p>Consistency certainly has a place in organisations that build and maintain many systems in order to to help prevent complexity. In my opinion, it’s better to see it as a guideline that will likely have exceptions. Simply seeking or worse, enforcing consistency is a sure-fire way to slow the team down, squash innovation and reduce learning opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="5-dont-forget-about-the-current-architectural-state">5. Don’t forget about the current architectural state</h2>
<p>It can be useful to model a target architecture based on agreed principles and in collaboration with engineers (see #1 and #3 above). However, it must be founded in all the nuance and understanding of the current architecture. Anything else could lead towards a doomed rewrite, an unhappy team or a failed pitch to some confused engineers.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I’ve seen many conversations where stakeholders begin to assume the target state is in fact the current state. This can have significant downsides for the engineering team, for example; a sense of moving too slow, missed tasks that were presumed completed or a lack of appreciation upon completing a large chunk of technical work. Stakeholder discussions about target state may need to include regular reminders about the current state.</p>
<h2 id="6-dont-get-too-attached-to-the-desired-architecture">6. Don’t get too attached to the desired architecture</h2>
<p>It can be easy to fall into the trap of attaching an opinion to your identity, particularly if you’ve got the task of providing a technical direction for an engineering team. New information and unforeseen circumstances will emerge, so any target state will 100% change. As these scenarios surface, you will need to keep an open mind to adapt your view and the direction. A fixed view will only hold back progress. As mentioned in #3, the architecture should be going through constant, incremental change.</p>
<h2 id="7-dont-let-review-processes-stagnate">7. Don’t let review processes stagnate</h2>
<p>As an architect in a large organisation you are likely to be responsible for or actively involved in architectural and security review processes, either as a reviewer or seeking a review. These processes are often change approval reviews that give the green-light for a production release. They can be long and drawn out, unclear in their value, involve reviewers who have zero context, and result in unwanted or unnecessary outcomes; making them the perfect candidates for resisting change. As a more senior figure, an architect should be working hard against that intuition. They should seek to understand the purpose and value of the review process and relay it to others. They should be leading or guiding engineering teams through these processes, particularly for the first time. But most importantly, they should be constantly pushing to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-streamlining-change-approval">improve, reduce or potentially remove a review process</a> depending on its purpose and added value.</p>
<p>There you have it! Hopefully I’ll learn even more things to avoid in future but for now, avoid these and you should be good; or at the very least better than a bunch of scenarios I’ve witnessed. For more advice on the topic of software architecture, check out these excellent reads too:</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><i>2020-11-28<!-- --> Carl Riis</i></p><hr><h3>How do you advance your Linux skills when you are already comfortable with the basics? My solution was to come up with 10 subjects to learn and create an accompanying mini-project.</h3><p>All the source code for the projects can be found in <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-things-linux">this</a> GitHub repository.</p><h2>1. UNIX - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/1_UNIX__Recat">Recat</a></h2><p>The first thing I wanted to learn more about was UNIX since Linux is a UNIX-like operating system. I also never really felt that I fully understood what exactly UNIX was, besides being a family of fairly similar operating systems.</p><p>The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX. I also read <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf">this</a> original paper written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from 1974, which was really interesting though I can’t say I understood all of it. After some more reading and some Youtube videos, I felt comfortable that I understood what UNIX was, and what makes it interesting.</p><p>For the project, I decided to try and write my first C program. Following the Unix philosophy, I made sure that it did one thing only. That thing ended up being a program that reverses the contents of a text file. Since this is just a reverse version of <em>cat</em>, I called the program <em>recat</em>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/1_UNIX__Recat/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>2. What is a shell? - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell">SeaShell</a></h2><p>For this project, I was curious to find out what exactly a shell was. Even though it is something that I use often, I was still confused about what differentiates it from the terminal. Turns out it’s really not that complicated. I learned this by rereading the <em>shell</em> part of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf">the paper</a> from the previous project, and some explanations online like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm">this</a> and <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">this one</a>. The Unix shell Wikipedia entry was also very informative.</p><p>Since this project is about the shell, I found it appropriate to try and write my own. I settled on the name <em>SeaShell</em>, which I found way too funny. It’s not very advanced, but it does the job.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>3. Ownership and permissions - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess">Tellaccess</a></h2><p>This is one of the things that I know is really important for Linux, but have never really understood. I have tried before but never been able to get the knowledge to stick, maybe because I didn't really care about security until now.</p><p>The ownership and permission system turned out to be really intuitive, and I was able to understand the basics from <a href="https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/">this</a> one article. I later discovered <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/">this one</a> from Linux Handbook which was more comprehensive.</p><p>For the project, I decided to create a program that tells you in human-readable form, the ownership and permissions of a file. I called the project <em>tellaccess</em> because it tells you who can access the file in what ways.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>4. Grep - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/4_Grep__Grep_detective">Grep detective</a></h2><p>Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn. Since <em>grep</em> is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first. This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the <em>POSIX Basic Regular Expressions</em>, which is not that common. The <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions">Wikipedia entry</a> was a lifesaver. Besides that, I also used the man page for <em>grep</em> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game. In the game, you get a folder full of files, and it’s your job to extract information. I called the game <em>Grep detective</em>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/4_Grep__Grep_detective/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>5. Awk and sed - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo">Passwdinfo</a></h2><p><em>Awk</em> and <em>sed</em> are more of the UNIX magic that I have always thought was really cool, though I never really understood what they were used for. I often saw answers on Stack Overflow with people using them in crazy one-liners, but I always copy-pasted them without much thought. Well, time to unravel the mystery.</p><p>I primarily used <a href="https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mijp1/teaching/2nd_year_Comp_Lab/guides/grep_awk_sed.pdf">this</a> paper to learn about them. For the project, I wanted to create my own one-liner that shows information about the users on your system in a clear way. I found just reading the <em>/etc/passwd</em> a little too messy, so the project <em>passwdinfo</em>, displays the most important information in a neat table. I found information about the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/">here</a>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>6. Find - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt">Find treasure hunt</a></h2><p>Another important tool I never really got around to learning. Learning how to use <em>find</em> was fairly easy, it was mostly about memorizing the different flags, and the format you set the flags in. I used <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm">this</a> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I created a treasure hunt where you look for clues in files with different attributes. I first wrote a script that created a bunch of small files and directories as noise. Then a selected few of the files got clues to the whereabouts of the other ones. In the end, you find the treasure, which I won’t tell you what is.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>7. File system - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/7_File_system__Root_tour">Root tour</a></h2><p>Ever since I executed my first <em>ls /</em> I have wondered what all those directories were for. Time to unveil the mystery. The first thing I did was read <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/">this</a> article as it explained each directory in root and provided a nice graph. <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html">This</a> resource was also nice since it had a table that summed up each directory in one or two sentences.</p><p>The project ended up being a program that gives you descriptions for directories in your own root folder.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/7_File_system__Root_tour/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>8. Processes - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/8_Processes__Stranger_danger">Stranger danger</a></h2><p>Processes are another important element of Linux that I have never gotten around to learning. Like many other subjects I have covered here, it turned out to be fairly intuitive. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/">This</a> article was really easy to understand.</p><p>I was contemplating for a while what kind of project I could create but ultimately came up with a command that prints all processes that don’t belong to you or root. That way, you can keep a close eye on who is creating processes. Note, there are many legitimate reasons that other users would run processes on your system, and it rarely means someone has gained access to your computer.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/8_Processes__Stranger_danger/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>9. Systemd services - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/9_Systemd_services__Createservice">Createservice</a></h2><p>Whenever I try to set up a database on a Linux machine I have been confused about how to configure the <em>systemd</em> service. I have also been in situations where I needed to create a service from a binary but always struggled. The struggle ends now.
As with any new subject, it’s always a good idea to read the Wikipedia page, so that is where I started. Surprisingly, I learned that <em>systemd</em> is a quite controversial piece of software, but I still wanted to learn it and judge it for myself.
For understanding the basics of <em>systemd</em> I read <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units">this</a> and for understanding how to create a new service I read <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/create-new-service-units-in-systemd/">this</a>.</p><p>For the project, I made <em>createservice</em>, which allows you to make a <em>systemd</em> service from any executable that will automatically start up on boot. Here I test it out on Prometheus:</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/9_Systemd_services__Createservice/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>10. Bash scripting - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher">Penguin cipher</a></h2><p>Bash scripting is something I have been avoiding for a long time. Partly because I believe that my programming language of choice, Go, is almost as handy when it comes to scripting, and partly because I think that Bash syntax looks horrible. Can’t knock it till you try it, so here I am trying to learn Bash scripting.</p><p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/">This</a> was a nice introduction, and after finding <a href="https://devhints.io/bash">this</a> cool cheatsheet I felt comfortable trying to create a project.</p><p>The project ended up being a cipher program I called <em>Penguin cipher</em> after Linux’s mascot. It allows you to encrypt text into something like this: <em>MTExIDIxMSAzMTMgNDAyIDQ2OCA0NjQgMTU5IDI0MSAyMzAgMzY3IDM3NCA1MjYgMTM3IDIyMiAyOTUgMzYzIDQzNCA0MzUg</em></p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><hr><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/carltheperson">Twitter</a></p><div><p>Email me at: <!-- -->  </p><div><p>c</p><p>a</p><p>r</p><p>l</p><p>t</p><p>h</p><p>e</p><p>p</p><p>e</p><p>r</p><p>s</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>_</p><p>p</p><p>r</p><p>o</p><p>t</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>m</p><p>a</p><p>i</p><p>l</p><p>:</p><p>c</p><p>o</p><p>m</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

        <h2>How is exploding app growth affecting consumer behavior?</h2>
<p>The mobile app economy is expected to double by 2024 and reach a staggering <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/mobile-app-spending-to-double-by-2024-despite-economic-impacts-of-covid-19/#:~:text=For%20starters%2C%20global%20spending%20in,year%20to%20hit%20%24102%20billion.">$171 billion</a></strong>. That’s roughly the value of the entire <strong><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/market-cap">McDonald’s Corporation</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Is your company looking to carve out a piece of that multi-billion-dollar pie?</p>
<p>With nearly <strong><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252">2 million apps</a></strong> available in Apple’s App Store and <strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1020964/apple-app-store-app-releases-worldwide/#:~:text=Number%20of%20monthly%20Apple%20App%20Store%20app%20releases%20worldwide%202020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20average,through%20the%20Apple%20App%20Store.">30,000 more</a></strong> added every month, so is everyone else.</p>
<p>We wanted to know how the app economy’s exploding growth is affecting consumer behavior, so we surveyed smartphone users to find out.</p>
<p>Specifically, as more brands launch and promote their own mobile apps, we wanted to know how users feel when they’re required to install these apps to place an order, use a product or try a service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did they find it frustrating?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How likely were they to install the app?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How regularly do they delete apps?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does deleting an app affect their opinion of a brand?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our research uncovered 11 app statistics that highlight significant customer pain points with the current state of mobile transactions. Going forward, companies must find solutions to these pain points. Those that don’t risk suffering both decreased market share and irrelevance.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a solution: <strong>App Clips.</strong></p>
<p>App Clips are small, lightweight portions of your full app that isolate a specific functionality and offer it to users as needed. They integrate seamlessly into tasks mobile users already are performing—such as browsing the web, searching for location-based recommendations or scanning visual tags—and offer brands organic opportunities to step in and provide value.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to rise above the noise in today’s overcrowded mobile app landscape, Apple iOS 14’s new App Clips are a no-brainer.</p>
<p>These 11 app statistics illustrate why.</p>

        <h3>The Take-Home Message</h3>
<p>Let’s recap what the data tells us about the current mobile app-related purchasing experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>68.5% of mobile phone users are moderately or extremely frustrated when they’re required to install an app to complete a transaction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>77.9% report abandoning a transaction because they didn’t want to install a required app.</strong></li>
<li><strong>30.3% say they’ve saved at least $100 in the last year by abandoning these transactions, with 7.8% saving at least $500.</strong></li>
<li><strong>58.5% who ultimately decide to install the required app still find the whole experience moderately or extremely frustrating and are 65.2% more likely to clean out their app inventory by deleting apps every week.</strong></li>
<li><strong>31.6% say deleting an app makes them think less of the company that created the app.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Where Apps Are Falling Short Today</h3>
<p>Those app statistics paint a clear picture and highlight three purchase-related pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Astounding numbers of abandoned transactions due to that frustration </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Increasing user demand for mobile apps</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Persistent and pervasive consumer frustration with current app-driven checkout processes</strong></p>
<p>Add all that up, and there’s an obvious and growing reservoir of unmet demand waiting to be tapped by businesses that can create seamless online purchasing experiences that facilitate instead of frustrate.</p>
<blockquote>iOS App Clips presents businesses with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</blockquote>

<h4>iOS 14 is Empowering Brands</h4>
<p>With the introduction of App Clips in iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a way to do just that by enabling organic, frustration-free, app-powered checkout processes. Now, businesses can embed select portions of their full mobile app’s functionality for customers to interact with natively without requiring installation.</p>
<p>This addresses all three of those pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1.Customers aren’t required to install an app to complete their transaction and enjoy a smooth, positive experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.Businesses capture more sales. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.Customers associate their positive experience with both the business’s mobile app and brand, making them more likely to install the full app for future transactions.</strong></p>
<p>iOS App Clips presents companies with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</p>
<p>And for businesses that don’t have a mobile app but want to take advantage of App Clips to create a customer-centric experience, now is the perfect time to design, build and launch an app with App Clips in mind.</p>

		<div>
			
<p><em>I had wrote this before the Unleashed was revealed, so some of the bits on economics have changed. As of writing this, I still stand by my other beliefs. </em>One of the most hyped things in hardware design is RISC-V, the open ISA available without license fees. Many organizations including <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/innovations/risc-v">Western Digital</a> have pledged support for RISC-V, and the open source community has a lot of faith in it, and with <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16080/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion">Nvidia’s recent purchase of Arm</a>, people are concerned. However, I feel these hopes are somewhat misleading, as RISC-V’s openness is less at the benefit of the user and more for CPU vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Royalties</strong>. One of the biggest benefits of RISC-V is not having to pay any royalties for a CPU using it. You might pay SiFive or someone else for a realization of their cores on hard silicon, but that’s for the design, not an abstract implementation of the ISA. Openness here means there’s more profit margin on the tiny chips running washing machines, since they don’t have to pay ARM or Synopsys. While the savings could be passed onto you, the ISA’s openness will never be of concern when the program is on a one-time-programmable ROM.</p>



<p><strong>ISA fragmentation</strong>. RISC-V intentionally defines a small ISA with extensions (for example, multiplication, which actually encompasses divide too… which is even more expensive to implement than multiply, but it’s a package deal). While most larger implementations will implement a common set of extensions, having basic functionality in extensions could make software compatibility for binary distributions harder. This is made worse by RISC-V explicitly encouraging custom instructions for task-specific tweaks on vendor silicon – great for embedded, not so hot for general purpose computers and operating systems supporting them.</p>



<p><strong>Economics</strong>. RISC-V has actively courted embedded, which makes sense as a niche. Much of the hype of RISC-V is hoping for laptop/desktop/server class silicon. This is unlikely, because the economics of embedded are different. ISA doesn’t matter as much in embedded programming (code reuse matters, but it’s not like you’re running arbitrary binaries), whereas user/enterprise focused computing usually lives and dies by binary compatibility (to protect investments in existing applications) and performance gained by things most RISC-V implementations don’t have yet like superscalar execution (To say nothing how these impact implementation complexity and security!).</p>



<p><strong>Openness doesn’t tickle down</strong>. The openness of an ISA doesn’t have much impact on the implementation. A design with restricted signing keys is completely acceptable under their licensing – and is very likely, considering the embedded dominance RISC-V is likely to have. There are no guarantees of openness in ways that impact a user (i.e controlling the root of trust), since a user doesn’t exactly have access to a fab.</p>



<p><strong>Design flaws</strong>. RISC-V seems like it hasn’t learned anything from CPUs designed after 1991. Between some <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">rookie mistakes</a> like few <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/yqqhxu/llvm_for_m68k_completed_not_merged">addressing modes</a> (register churn, code density) and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/icegvf/will_risc_v_revolutionize_computing#c_8wbb6t">blowing out the encoding space</a>. However, despite its flaws, it’s poised to take over embedded and possibly beyond anyways – worse truly is better.</p>



<p>Overall, RISC-V will lead in a revolution for nationalist vanity CPUs (think Loongson; no one will run them but for show and perhaps a niche of radical ideologues) , academic projects, and embedded vendors wanting to save on their balance sheets, but it probably won’t affect users or developers.</p>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/examples/getting-started.ipynb"><img alt="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"></a></p><p>CompilerGym is a toolkit for applying reinforcement learning to compiler
optimization tasks. This document provides a short walkthrough of the key
concepts, using the codesize reduction task of a production-grade compiler
as an example. It will take about 20 minutes to work through. Lets get
started!</p>

<div id="key-concepts">
<h2><a href="#id3">Key Concepts</a><a href="#key-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CompilerGym exposes compiler optimization problems as environments for
reinforcement learning. It uses the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>
interface to expose the “agent-environment loop” of reinforcement learning:</p>
<p><img alt="_images/overview.png" src="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/_images/overview.png"></p><p>The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>: a compiler optimization task. For example,
<em>optimizing a C++ graph-traversal program for codesize using LLVM</em>. The
environment encapsulates an instance of a compiler and a particular program
that is being compiled. As an agent interacts with the environment, the state
of the program, and the compiler, can change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Space</strong>: the actions that may be taken at the current environment
state. For example, this could be a set of optimization transformations that
the compiler can apply to the program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation</strong>: a view of the current environment state. For example, this
could be the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program that is being
compiled. The types of observations that are available depend on the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward</strong>: a metric indicating the quality of the previous action. For
example, for a codesize optimization task this could be the change to the
number of instructions of the previous action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A single instance of this “agent-environment loop” represents the compilation of
a particular program. The goal is to develop an agent that maximises the
cumulative reward from these environments so as to produce the best programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2><a href="#id4">Installation</a><a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Install the latest CompilerGym release using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The binary works on macOS and Linux (on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, Debian
10 or newer equivalents).</p>
<div id="building-from-source">
<h3><a href="#id5">Building from Source</a><a href="#building-from-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you prefer, you may build from source. This requires a modern C++
toolchain. On macOS you can use the system compiler. On linux, install
the required toolchain using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt install clang libtinfo5 patchelf
$ export CC=clang
$ export CXX=clang++
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We recommend using
<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/">conda</a>
to manage the remaining build dependencies. First create a conda
environment with the required dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda create -n compiler_gym python=3.8 bazel=3.1.0 cmake pandoc
$ conda activate compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then clone the CompilerGym source code using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym.git
$ cd CompilerGym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Install the python development dependencies using:</p>

<p>Then run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:</p>

<p>To build and install the python package, run:</p>

<p>When you are finished, you can deactivate and delete the conda
environment using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda deactivate
$ conda env remove -n compiler_gym

<h3><a href="#id7">Selecting an environment</a><a href="#selecting-an-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CompilerGym environments are named using one of the following formats:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;observation&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where <code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;</span></code> identifiers the compiler optimization task,
<code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code> is the default type of observations that are provided,
and <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> is the reward signal.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A key concept is that
CompilerGym environments enables <strong>lazy evaluation</strong> of observations and
reward signals. This makes the environment much more computationally
efficient for scenarios in which you do not need to compute a reward or
observation for every step. If an environment omits a <code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code>
or <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> tag, this means that no observation or reward is
provided by default. See <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/views.html"><span>compiler_gym.views</span></a> for
further details.</p>
</div>
<p>For this tutorial, we will use the following environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compiler</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html"><span>LLVM</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation Type</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#autophase"><span>Autophase</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward Signal</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#codesize"><span>IR Instruction count relative to -Oz</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create an instance of this environment using:</p>

<h3><a href="#id8">Installing benchmarks</a><a href="#installing-benchmarks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A compiler requires a program as input. For the purposes of CompilerGym we call
these input programs <em>benchmarks</em>, and collections of benchmarks are assembled
into <em>datasets</em>. You may provide your own programs to use as benchmarks, or
download one of our pre-assembled datasets.</p>
<p>The benchmarks that are available to an environment can be queried using

<p>As you can see, there are no benchmarks installed by default. We have provided
a collection of pre-assembled

<p>For this environment, reward represents the reduction in code size of the
previous action, scaled to the total codesize reduction achieved with LLVM’s
<code><span>-Oz</span></code> optimizations enabled. A cumulative reward greater than one means
that the sequence of optimizations performed yields better results than LLVM’s
default optimizations. Let’s run 100 random actions and see how close we can

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><p>When we announced our license change for Elasticsearch and Kibana, moving the Apache 2.0-licensed source code to be dual licensed under both the Elastic License and SSPL, we also <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">mentioned</a> we would work closely with the community on a simplified and more permissive version of the Elastic License. I am happy to share the results with you.</p><p>The Elastic License is already widely used. More than 90% of our downloads are under the Elastic License, and those users enjoy the significant additional <a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">value provided</a> under the free and open Basic tier. Thanks to this value, the majority of our users and community are already using the software under the Elastic License, so they viewed our recent license change as a non-event. We are happy to see it, because our intent is to minimize any disruption to our community.</p><p>We took this opportunity to engage with our community and find ways to further simplify the Elastic License. After talking to users who reached out for clarification, we believe this new version will help to significantly address the majority of your&nbsp;concerns while protecting our products from <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">abuse, misinformation, and confusion</a>.
</p></div><h2>Elastic License v2
</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license">Elastic License v2 (ELv2)</a> is a very simple, non-copyleft license, allowing for the right to "use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software” and has only three high-level limitations. You cannot:
</p><ol><li>Provide the products to others as a managed service&nbsp;</li><li>Circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys&nbsp;</li><li>Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices</li></ol><p>ELv2 applies to all of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It covers the distribution as well as the source code of all free and paid features.<br></p><p>We share our source code for both free and paid features in the spirit of openness. Unfortunately, our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">copyrights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">trademarks</a> have been abused and misused. Our goal with this updated license is to be as permissive as possible while including a minimum set of protections. I hope these protections make sense. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq">See our FAQ</a> for more information about ELv2.
</p><div><p>We created ELv2 to hopefully allow others to adopt it. This is the license we wished was available in 2015 when we were a small company facing <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">misinformation</a>. It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.

																		<p><span>Look at photos of </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/double-mask-coronavirus_ca_60140605c5b653f644d2ed5b?ncid=tweetlnkcahpmg00000002"><span>President Joe Biden and you’ll notice he often wears two masks</span></a><span>: a light cloth or paper one over a heavy-duty N95 mask. “If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on,” </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/dr-fauci-double-mask-during-covid-makes-common-sense-more-effective.html"><span>said Dr. Anthony Fauci</span></a><span>, who has also frequently </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MayorBowser/status/1341835973722734592?s=20"><span>worn two masks</span></a><span>. “It just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But there is also some urgency to this shift: With the arrival of new and more contagious variants to Canada, experts are asking everyone to think once again about the quality of our masks and how we use them. “We all need a bit of a reset regarding [COVID-19] precautions,” says Dr. Lynora Saxinger, </span><span>an infectious diseases physician in Edmonton. “We tend to cut corners and relax when something becomes commonplace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For one thing, she says,</span><span> don’t shove a mask into your pocket after wearing it; if you’re asymptomatic, then the virus will be easily transferred from the mask to your hands. For another, don’t be complacent regarding the type and quality of your face coverings, such as masks that are comfortable to wear because they use porous materials, or </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html#a9"><span>neck gaiters, which can easily slip</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In fact, many of the masks we’re using aren’t as good as they should be. And, unlike last spring when the initial guidance around masks included recommending face coverings of tightly woven fabric, the risk perception has now changed. The new variants are so much more effective at infecting people that it’s time for a refresher course in face protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html"><span>Health Canada’s guidelines</span></a><span> emphasize that masks need proper structure, material and fit to reduce the spread of infectious respiratory droplets. For example, Saxinger uses a couple of well-fitted multi-layer fabric masks, each with added filters of polypropylene material which she bought separately, in addition to cycling through lightly-worn medical masks, which she stores in separate envelopes for a few days before using them. And now, unlike in the spring, medical-quality disposable masks as well as more tightly fitted KN95 masks are available through retailers</span> <span>including </span><a href="https://www.costco.ca/kn95-disposable-5-layer-face-mask%2C-20-pack.product.100672009.html"><span>Costco</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.canadiansafetysupplies.com/Level-2-Hospital-Medical-3-Ply-Surgical-Masks-p/350117.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6t6ABhDMARIsAONIYywfEhF1lBHDuf6XEc1nB9jQgZ_kni7_n69ikdQ7cCcEJJR2jNETNncaAti8EALw_wcB"><span>health care supply firms</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wellwise.ca/en-ca/products/total-care-kn95-mask"><span>pharmacies</span></a><span> (supplies can fluctuate; also, many of the disposable masks and KN95s on the market are not medical grade).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>While there is no official Canadian or U.S. guidance regarding double-masking or the need to upgrade to better quality masks, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/26/960893423/some-european-countries-move-to-require-medical-grade-masks-in-public"><span>Germany, Austria and France</span></a><span> recently told their residents to upgrade their face coverings from cloth versions to specific medical-grade ones, including KN95s, when they are in public spaces, including stores, or when near others for a prolonged period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The more layers the better, as long as they are breathable,” says Saxinger. Doubling up with whatever masks you have—whether two cloth ones, or a cloth and a disposable one—can offer more protection, as they can provide another layer of filtration and force a tighter fit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Many people, even among security experts and privacy advocates, hold the firm
belief that WhatsApp is more <em>secure</em> and privacy-wise better than Telegram.
After having thoroughly studied the issue, I do not believe this to be true.
In this article I will try to highlight the necessary facts to enable the
reader to form a more informed opinion on the matter.</p>

</section>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Most sources which praise WhatsApp and criticize Telegram make bold claims,
presenting them as objective truth, without
sufficiently motivating them or backing them up with facts. In many cases they
rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Telegram] By default, it is less safe than @WhatsApp, which makes [it] dangerous
for non-experts. — <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/778597417797226496" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ed. Snowden (Sep, 2016)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize that many of you will be sceptical now. After all, if Edward Snowden
said so, it <em>must</em> be true. Why would you question it? And why, above all, should we <em>believe</em> you instead?</p>
<p>Well, the point is exactly this. I am not asking you to believe <em>me</em>, but to
evaluate the facts, with an open mind, before forming an opinion.
Moreover, even if it might be hard to accept, even heroes and geniuses like Edward
Snowden can be wrong from time to time!</p>
<p>I made a good faith attempt to research all the facts and present them as
objectively as possible, without including personal biases. However, please
keep in mind that I do not consider myself infallible, and thus there might be
some mistakes. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>




<h2 id="fallacies">The fallacies</h2>
<p>The vast majority of things I read on this topic can be reduced to a combination
of the following factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not considering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">threat model</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_premise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">false premise</a> that end-to-end encryption alone is a necessary and
sufficient condition for good security and privacy.</li>
<li>The erroneous conclusion that everything that is not end-to-end encrypted is
inherently less secure and must be avoided at all cost.</li>
<li>The huge respect for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Moxie Marlinspike</a>, one of the authors of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption protocol</a> used by WhatsApp and
Signal, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>.</li>
<li>Outright lies about the insecurity of the cryptographic protocol used by
Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the article is dedicated to amply clarify each of the points
above. In <a href="#threat-models">section 3</a> I will articulate the importance of considering threat
models when trying to determine if a system is <em>secure</em>. In <a href="">section 4</a>
I will discuss end-to-end encryption, the challenges that it entails and how it
is implemented in WhatsApp and Telegram. In <a href="#telegram">section 5</a> I will address the most
common criticisms of Telegram, and finally, in <a href="#conclusion">section 6</a>, I will draw some conclusions.</p>


<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Searching on Hacker News for <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=%22whatsapp%20is%20more%20secure%22&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“WhatsApp is more secure”</a>
yields some typical comments from people arguing that WhatsApp is more secure
than Telegram</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram is more fun (bots and stickers), but <strong>WhatsApp is more secure</strong>
(no messages on server, no rolled-your-own-crypto). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14374644" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even that Telegram is the least secure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can anyone call “Telegram” secure? Those days are over. It’s the least
secure messaging app of them all now. <strong>Even WhatsApp is more secure than
Telegram</strong> (let alone Threema). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13032192" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, what does it really mean that WhatsApp is <em>more secure</em>? Secure against the
government? Secure against your friendly neighbourhood hacker snooping on
the Wi-Fi at Starbucks?
Secure against throwing rocks at your phone? Secure against your mom trying to
read your messages?</p>
<p>Defending from an adversary with practically unlimited budget and computational
resources, such as a powerful government, is going to be much harder than
defending against a curious neighbour sniffing on your Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>Saying that WhatsApp is more secure than Telegram,
without specifying against what kind of adversary or against what kind of threat,
does not mean much.</strong></p>

<p>Without considering these questions and only craving for <em>“more security”</em>, <strong>is
not necessarily a smart thing</strong> either.
In the same way that putting your possessions in a nuclear bunker
might be more secure, in
case of a nuclear war, than locking them in a small safe in your room, but could
not be the best choice if all you are trying to do is protect your Blu-ray
collection from your flatmate!
Moreover, <strong>increasing security is often not free</strong>, because
it increases complexity, thus development cost, and can decrease usability. Exactly like a nuclear bunker
is going to be much more expensive than a small safe and is also not going to be
as easy to use.
Lastly, it is important to note that <strong>you are as secure as the weakest link in your system</strong>.
Therefore, if you want a nuclear bunker, with all the challenges and costs that
it entails, but then forget to put a lock on its door, it might not protect you that
much after all.</p>


<p>Consequently, let us now try to examine which of the <em>components</em> involved in
using a messaging app can be potentially attacked by a malicious agent,
compromising our security.
For each of these, <em>you</em> need to establish if you blindly trust it to function
correctly, or if you believe it could be compromised and thus need to find a way
to defend it from the potential threat.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The companies running the servers needed by the app to work</strong>. That is,
Facebook, Telegram and whatever other third party services they decide to
use or share your data with.<ol>
<li>Are you OK with them being able to read your messages?</li>
<li>Do you trust them on keeping your data safe? So that it does not get
stolen, for example.</li>
<li>Are you OK with them selling your data or meta-data to advertisers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The app itself</strong>. That is, the WhatsApp or Telegram apps on your
phone.<ol>
<li>Do you trust that it does exactly what it says and is not malicious? For
example that it is always encrypting your messages.</li>
<li>Do you trust its developers to be good citizens and not insert backdoors?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The communication medium</strong>. That is, the Internet.<ol>
<li>Do you trust the connection between you and the app’s servers to be
secure?</li>
<li>Do you trust your ISP?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The distribution and update process</strong>. For example, the Play Store, App
Store or F-Droid. Do you trust Google and Apple to give you the real app,
and not a specially crafted one to spy on you?</li>
<li><strong>The other apps on your phone</strong>. Do you trust all the other apps on your
phone, or do you think some of them might be malware?</li>
<li><strong>The OS</strong>. That is, Android or iOS. Do you trust your
operative system and its developers (e.g. Google, Samsung, Apple)? For example,
do you trust that no malicious actor can remotely <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/gaps-in-google-play-store-xfo-allow-attackers-to-remotely-install-malware-on-android-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">install</a>
or <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/06/exercising-our-remote-application.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uninstall</a> software on your device?</li>
<li><strong>The firmware and the hardware</strong>. Do you trust your phone is not running
malware at the firmware or hardware level,
<a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SamsungGalaxyBackdoor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">like it was discovered on Samsung phones in 2014</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, that was quite a list!</p>
<p>But, <strong>do we really need to care about all of this stuff?</strong> Well, not many
people do.
However, if you want to evaluate which messaging app best suits your needs and
you care a bit about security and privacy, then it is essential.
This process will enable you to decide for yourself, without basing your decision
on some tweet saying that one app is <em>more secure</em> than the other.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is important to reiterate that if you are worried that a powerful
adversary, like a government, might want to directly target you (as opposed to
compromise you as part of a mass surveillance program), you cannot defend only
against one attack vector and ignore the others.
You can have the most secure messaging app in the world, but if your phone can be hacked
with an SMS, there is not much of a difference.</p>


<p>You might wonder why couldn’t we just try to defend ourselves against all possible
threats and attacks. It is because, as we said before and as we will show in more
detail in the next section, increasing security is not free but comes
with the cost of increased complexity and very often decreased usability.</p>

<h2 id="e2ee">End-to-end encryption</h2>
<p>Let us now address the most common reason that induces people to believe that
WhatsApp is a better choice: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p>

<p>WhatsApp describes end-to-end encryption (or E2EE for short) in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you’re communicating
with can read or listen to what is sent, and nobody in between, not even
WhatsApp. This is because with end-to-end encryption, your messages are
secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key
needed to unlock and read them. All of this happens automatically: no need to
turn on any special settings to secure your messages. — <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WhatsApp nowadays has end-to-end encryption enabled by default for all chats,
while Telegram has not enabled it by default and does not support it on group
chats.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a very nice property to have. If implemented correctly it
allows us to communicate securely, even in the case in which the server (i.e.
WhatsApp or Telegram) cannot be trusted and is considered malicious.
However, if we decide to go down this road and not trust any more the companies
running our app, we introduce a series of new complications.</p>
<p>However, one could argue that even in the case in which we decide to trust the
Service, it is beneficial to have end-to-end encryption. This is a valid point because, while
we might trust the Service, for sure we do not trust some potential malicious
actors compromising the Service’s infrastructure and getting access to our data. In
this scenario our data should still be safe because not even the Service has
access to it, and therefore an attacker cannot steal the decryption key nor
coerce the Service to disclose it. This is the major strength of
E2EE.
Nonetheless, it is worth to stress that in this scenario we assumed to trust
the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Http2SQL is a free api which will allow you to query any SQL database from an HTTP request.
It uses <a href="https://sequelize.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize</a> to handle the connection</p>
<p>It's free to use and doesn't require an API key or authentication. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Cosbgn/zero-labs/blob/master/api/http2sql.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>With Zero you can build great interactive dashboards pulling data directly from your SQL database! It's free!
Give it a try at <a href="https://zero.sh/play" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zero.sh/play</a></p>
<h2 id="1-make-sure-that-your-request-is-private-and-from-a-secure-connection">1. Make sure that your request is private and from a secure connection</h2>
<p>This API requires that you pass the entire database connection URI. This contains your username and password so never use this API directly from your frontend or from somewhere where users can access it.</p>
<p>If you use it on Zero.sh save your connection string on a <code>secret</code> and use that.</p>
<h2 id="2-format-your-request">2. Format your request</h2>
<p>This API accepts only <strong>POST</strong> requests to this endpoint: <code>https://labs.zero.sh/api/http2sql</code></p>
<p>The following data is allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>uri</strong>:
You database connection uri, e.g. <code>postgres:// ...</code>.</li>
<li><strong>query</strong>:
Your SQL query, e.g. <code>Select * from "Users"</code></li>
<li><strong>config_object</strong>:
If you don't want to pass the URI you can alternatively pass a <a href="https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize connection object</a> - e.g. <code>{dialect: 'mysql', etc}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You always need to pass a <code>query</code> and either the <code>uri</code> or the <code>config_object</code></p>
<h2 id="3-your-response">3. Your response</h2>
<p>The tool will either return and error or, in case of success the sequelize response. (Note: This can be null, for example <code>INSERT INTO</code> statements)</p>

		 <h4>Surprising sound let down by serious comfort problems</h4>

		 
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=6b8a0daf46384709fee2520ad544cdff"></p>
<p>I’m conflicted about Apple’s latest foray into audio products, the AirPods Max over-ear headphones.</p>
<p>In striking opposition to every other review I’ve seen so far, I get to begin mine by stating that I <em>am</em> an audiophile. A friendly, reasonable one, but still—<a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/plague-inc-the-cure">audio is my jam</a>. I’ve been writing music for games and film for over 10 years, so one would hope that I’ve learned a thing or two about audio production in that time. It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.</p>

<p>Apple has had a long and fruitful relationship with music, but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products. Beats are a common entry point into the world of audio, but they’re priced the way they are because of their brand power, not because their quality justifies it. You can get much better sound, comfort, features, and build for less money.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself wondering to what extent that is also true for the AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Having forked over just under $900 <span>CAD</span> for the privilege of owning a pair, I wanted to see whether Apple is aiming to establish itself as a purveyor of quality audio gear—deserving of a high price tag—or whether we’ll once again be paying for style over substance.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-5.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=3b6c49e79651f9f936486a7886ff54db"></p>

<p>I laughed when I pulled the AirPods Max out of their box. I knew they would be heavy, but the experience of that weight is really something else.</p>
<p>For context, the Sennheiser <span>PXC</span> 550—my current headphone choice for travel—weigh 227g. The famously comfortable Bose 700 weigh 254g, a weight that’s matched by the popular Sony WH-1000XM4. Premium pairs like the Bang &amp; Olufsen <span>H9</span> (third generation) weigh 295g, and the Bowers &amp; Wilkins <span>PX7</span> just barely crest the 300g mark.</p>
<p>The AirPods Max weigh <em>385g</em>.</p>
<p>In the same way that the iPhone 12’s aluminum build <em>looks</em> less fancy but <em>feels</em> nicer in use than its Pro counterparts and their stainless steel, the mostly-metal build of the AirPods Max is a choice that favours fashion over comfort.</p>
<p>The reason that other high-end headphone manufacturers lean heavily on plastic and even wood in their builds isn’t that they can’t afford metal. It’s because they’re interested in having human beings wear these products on their heads for hours at a time.</p>
<p>As one such human being with a head, I wish Apple had taken some cues from the competition on this front. Even after adjusting the way I wear them, I can’t escape the fact that these are just plain <em>uncomfortable</em> for long listening sessions. The mesh headband and foam ear cups do their best to mitigate this, but they can’t compensate for the sheer weight.</p>
<p>The headband is terrific. It may be my favourite approach to one that I’ve seen on a headphone. I have to wear the band further back on my head than I do with other headphones, but once I figured that out I was able to wear them for longer before needing a break. The ear cups are less impressive. They’re spacious and fairly well padded, but the material that’s used feels somewhat cheap and scratchy in texture. I suspect it’s more breathable than typical leather or vinyl ear cups, but the physical impression isn’t as good and I don’t particularly like how they feel on my face.</p>
<p>Then there’s the clamping force, which is <em>very</em> strong; AirPods Max squeeze your head like a musical bear hug. This is a common problem with heavy headphones, so I wasn’t surprised to see it here, but it accounts for the majority of the comfort problems I have.</p>
<p>The pressure points will differ depending on your fit, but I offered these to two other people in my vicinity for some extended listening and both reported discomfort; one on the top of their head, the other around their ears where the clamp force put pressure on the jaw. Personally, I experience it mainly as a headache after about the half hour to one hour mark.</p>
<p>Let’s disregard weight for a moment, though. These are fine for shorter listening sessions and everyone’s head is different, so I’m sure there are folks out there who will find them to be perfectly comfortable. The problems with metal go beyond weight: by prioritizing fashion value over practical value, Apple has committed a series of unforced errors.</p>
<p>Anodized aluminum feels nice and soft, but that softness means they scuff easily…like, say, when you fold them flat and notice that the ear cups bump and scratch against each other. This happens all the time and it makes me cringe every time; it’s like the horrible scraping that iMac users will be familiar with from trying to plug something into the rear ports. Also, parts of the world experience a season called winter, where the temperature drops and metal surfaces become dangerous things your skin will stick to.</p>
<p>Now, about that<span></span> <span>“</span>protective case”.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-8.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=392ed93e8e6a65298b215cf68f228603"></p>
<p>I want to save myself some typing and point you to <a href="https://youtu.be/Gvvo6vUpJRc?t=639" target="_blank">the part of <span>MKBHD</span><span></span><span>’</span>s review video</a> where he talks about the storage solution that these $900 headphones ship with. Go ahead and give that a watch. Back? Great. What he said. Before getting these, I thought the hate for the case was hyperbolic, but the truth is it really <em>does</em> feel cheap and pointless, particularly after <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">Apple clarified</a> that it isn’t necessary for putting the headphones into standby mode.</p>
<p>Before we leave the topic of their physical design, I want to share one last complaint about the AirPods Max: the buttons. I don’t mind the feel of them myself (though a friend felt they were cheap and unpleasant), but I <em>do</em> mind the way they work. The Digital Crown, which controls volume, is also the button that controls playback and Siri. The other, larger button is used to switch between the listening modes: Active Noise Cancellation (<span>ANC</span>), Transparency mode, and none.</p>
<p>I appreciate having physical controls for these things, but I intuitively expected that all the audio-related functions would be accessed from one button and that the playback and feature controls would be accessed from the other. Tying playback controls to the volume knob feels strange to me, and increases the chances of unintentional volume changes when you’re trying to execute a double or triple press—something made even trickier if you’re wearing gloves.</p>
<p>There is, naturally, no way to configure these button assignments. At best, you’re able to change the scrolling direction of the volume knob and restrict which listening modes the other button switches between, but that’s about it. That latter feature also seems to be buggy in the current firmware (<span>3C16</span>) because despite enabling all three, I find that it defaults back to just Noise Cancellation or Transparency whenever I reconnect.</p>
<p>Deal-breaker? No.&nbsp;But another strange design choice to wrap up this section.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-7.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=f6b19d4c7ef961a06df1a759fc2f45b5"></p>
<p>Wait, one more complaint: the battery life is the shortest of any headphone in this category. This isn’t an issue in and of itself considering they’ll still last through a full day of listening. Still, I hoped that some of that excess size and weight would translate into battery capacity.</p>
<p>On the topic of power, Apple has indicated that the AirPods Max have two low-power states and you <em>don’t</em> need the case to access them—great news since I refuse to use that stupid thing. Here’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">what they say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you set your AirPods Max down and leave them stationary for 5 minutes, they go into a low power mode to preserve battery charge. After 72 stationary hours out of the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into a lower power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My to preserve battery charge further. If you put your AirPods Max in the Smart Case when you’re not using them, they go into a low power mode immediately to preserve battery charge. After 18 hours in the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into an ultralow power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My and maximizes battery life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, <em>now</em> I’m done talking about the physical characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="sonic-boom">Sonic Boom</h2>
<p>So there I was, shaking my head at the weight and the design while I got them connected. I was already looking up Apple’s holiday return policy when I hit play on my usual suite of test material and…oh.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-4.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=a34de6bb9c7c71b5c5ccbfad05e1c8f6"></p>
<p>I was reminded of <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-bowers-wilkins-p7-wireless-headphones-review/" target="_blank">the first time</a> a pair of wireless headphones impressed me. I put them on and somehow found myself lying on the floor of my room, two hours later, having become completely lost in the music. Since then, <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/bang-olufsen-h9i">other headphones</a> have achieved this magical time-dilation effect, but I didn’t expect to feel it coming from an Apple product.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, Apple has amazing audio engineers. <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-pro">I adore my AirPods Pro</a>. They’re not the best value for money in terms of sound, but they have a pleasant, relatively neutral profile and have become my daily listening companions. Similarly, the HomePod is my favourite smart speaker for sound because it manages to provide a remarkably full and dynamic listening experience for a compact mono sound source.</p>
<p>In a word, the AirPods Max sound <em>sublime</em>.</p>
<p>They have a beautiful way of making you feel immersed and enveloped by the music, with a tremendously wide soundstage, solid instrument placement, and some of the most articulate dynamics I’ve heard from consumer equipment. They remind me of my open-back studio headphone and amp setup (the geeky audiophile equipment) more than other wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Several hours of listening later, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just experiencing some sort of hallucination caused by the extreme clamping force of these metallic behemoths, so I called up my friend and had him bring over his pair of Bang &amp; Olufsen H9i—<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/articles/a-roundup-of-the-best-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-headphones/" target="_blank">my previous benchmark</a> for best wireless <span>ANC</span> headphones—to do some critical listening.</p>
<p>We cruised through our respective music libraries, selecting favourite tracks and listening, each of us with one of the pairs on. Then we’d swap <a href="https://atp.fm/409" target="_blank">(as others have pointed …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Writeup by: <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderkrog">Zanderdk</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On the 2021-01-26 qualy released this <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt">article</a> describing a “new” (actually 10 year old) bug in sudo that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation though a heap buffer overflow.
Unfortunately they did not release exploit/POC so I decided to build one myself and failed. It turned out that Pewz from the CTF team bootplug had the same thought and our combined forces allowed us to successfully exploit this bug on the newest libc 2.32 in an arch environment with sudo version 1.9.4p2.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p>I will only briefly cover the vulnerability here as it’s quite well described in the article.</p>
<p>In an essence an attacker can overflow a heap chunk by inserting a single backslash at the end of any argv or env argument given to sudo, causing the following argument to be written out of bound. Let’s look at a simplified version of one of the code snippets from the article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> (size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; <span>*</span>av; av<span>++</span>)
  size <span>+=</span> strlen(<span>*</span>av) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;
...
<span>if</span> (size <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> (user_args <span>=</span> malloc(size)) <span>==</span> NULL) {
  <span>//do some stuff we don't care about
</span><span></span>}
...
<span>for</span> (to <span>=</span> user_args, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; (from <span>=</span> <span>*</span>av); av<span>++</span>) {
  <span>while</span> (<span>*</span>from) {
    <span>if</span> (from[<span>0</span>] <span>==</span> <span>'\\'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>isspace((<span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span>)from[<span>1</span>]))
      from<span>++</span>;
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span>from<span>++</span>;
    }
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>' '</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>As we see in the first for loop we are iterating over each argument and finding the size (plus null terminator) of it using <code>strlen</code>. Now lets say we have the string <code>"AAAA\\"</code> (<code>\\</code> is one char).</p>
<p>The size will be 5 and it will only do an allocation of 5 bytes assuming this is the only argument.</p>
<p>In the next part we have a outer for loop over arguments and an inner loop copying the contents of all the arguments into the single buffer, <code>user_args</code>, essentially concatenating all arguments.</p>
<p>Considering the same string as before, <code>"AAAA\\"</code>, when we hit <code>from[0]=='\\'</code> we go into the if and increment <code>from</code> by <code>from++</code>, incrementing <code>from</code> so it points to the null terminator. After that we continue the loop with the next statement <code>*to++ = *from++;</code> copying the null terminator and again incrementing <code>from</code> to continue copying bytes after the null terminator we continue copying out of bounds.</p>
<p>This happens because it expects that every <code>\\</code> is followed by a meta-character, which the authors came up with a clever way of avoiding, leaving this vulnerable to a overflow. Read the article if you want to know why and how we can end up having a single <code>\\</code> in the args when entering this block.</p>
<p>By using the symbolic link <code>sudoedit</code> to <code>sudo</code> we can make this happen:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kalmarunionen.dk/images/overflow.png" alt="sudo exploit overflowing"></p>
<h3 id="properties-of-the-overflow">Properties of the overflow</h3>
<p>The authors state 3 important properties about this overflow which make it quite powerful.</p>
<p>First and simplest we control the allocation size of <code>user_args</code> as we chose how many and how long we make the arguments to sudo.</p>
<p>Second we control the contents of the overflowed area.
This we can achieve by using the supplied environment variables. The environment variables is infact stored right after the last argument passed to <code>sudoedit</code> meaning that if we do <code>env -i 'A=BBBB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC'</code> we insert the C’s into the user_args buffer and <code>A=BBBB</code> will follow in the out of bounds area. Be aware that chunk size’s align to sizes of 0x10 so e.g. <code>env -i 'A=BB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCBBBBBBBB'</code> will only fill the buffer.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention to the inner loop in our concatenation block you probably noticed that we can exploit this multiple times. By ending a environment variable with <code>\\</code> we can make another skip to the next environment variable. So why would we like that? Because as the <code>from++</code> increments the pointer to the null terminator on the following <code>to++ = *from++;</code> it will insert that null terminator. This makes us able to insert 0x0 as well without ending the overflow making this overflow extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Example from the authors:</p>
<p><code>env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'</code></p>
<p>This will end up like this in the buffer:</p>
<pre><code>--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
              size  &lt;---- user_args buffer ----&gt;  size      fd       bk
</code></pre><p>So we wont go into what forward (fd) or backwards (bk) pointers of a heap chunk mean as we are only exploiting in use memory.
Super short and oversimplified description:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first size is the size of the following chunk. It is equal to 0x10 + argument given to malloc as we also need space for size itself and alignment/previous size.</li>
<li>the next size is the contiguous chunks size.</li>
<li>fd and bk are pointers to the next and previous chunk respectively in this linked list of freed chunks. This only applies to freed chunks. Otherwise this space is available to the caller of malloc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know more about this topic I strongly encourage you to read the <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/">Azeria’s blog about heap exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>Now an important note to make here about the null terminator insertion I think the original paper lacks is that we can insert multiple contiguous null bytes as well.</p>
<p>First thing to understand is that environment variables don’t have to in the form of <code>SOMETHING=something_more</code>. As everything else these are just char arrays and we can do what we can with them in C. as example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>char</span> <span>*</span>args[] <span>=</span> { <span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, <span>"-s"</span>, <span>"AAAAAAAA"</span>, NULL };
<span>char</span> <span>*</span>env[] <span>=</span> { <span>"BBBBBBBB"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"CCCCCCCC"</span>, NULL };
execve(<span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, argv, env);
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using execve to execute the process with full control of the environment variables.
In the inner for loop we run into the if statement at ´"\\“´ and by that skipping one char by <code>from++</code> the backslash and only inserting the null jumping onto the next ´”\\“´ and consequently inserting two null bytes in a row.</p>
<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>While the authors mention 3 possible targets here in this writeup we will only cover the second one.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>no brute-force involved in contrast to the first option where they partially overflow a function pointer defeating ASLR with brute-force.</li>
<li>They state that they did it successfully for 3 operating systems where both the other two were only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second option we try to overflow into a <code>service_user</code> struct stored on the heap.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> service_user
{
  <span>/* And the link to the next entry.  */</span>
  <span>struct</span> service_user <span>*</span>next;
  <span>/* Action according to result.  */</span>
  lookup_actions actions[<span>5</span>];
  <span>/* Link to the underlying library object.  */</span>
  service_library <span>*</span>library;
  <span>/* Collection of known functions.  */</span>
  <span>void</span> <span>*</span>known;
  <span>/* Name of the service (`files', `dns', `nis', ...).  */</span>
  <span>char</span> name[<span>0</span>];
} service_user;
</code></pre></div><p>This struct is used in the <code>nss_load_library</code> of libc quite often after the overflow happens for loading new dynamically linked libraries, and can we overflow the name filed then we control what library to load.
Then we can target some non privileged library we can craft that will run with the privileges of root. :-)</p>
<p>The function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>static</span> <span>int</span>
<span>nss_load_library</span> (service_user <span>*</span>ni)
{
  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>static</span> name_database default_table;
      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>=</span> nss_new_service (service_table <span>?:</span> <span>&amp;</span>default_table,
				     ni<span>-&gt;</span>name);
      <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
	<span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>;
    }

  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>/* Load the shared library.  */</span>
      size_t shlen <span>=</span> (<span>7</span> <span>+</span> strlen (ni<span>-&gt;</span>name) <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
		      <span>+</span> strlen (__nss_shlib_revision) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>);
      <span>int</span> saved_errno <span>=</span> errno;
      <span>char</span> shlib_name[shlen];

      <span>/* Construct shared object name.  */</span>
      __stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (shlib_name,
					      <span>"libnss_"</span>),
				    ni<span>-&gt;</span>name),
			  <span>".so"</span>),
		__nss_shlib_revision);

      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>=</span> __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
      <span>//continue long long function
</span></code></pre></div><p>The goal with this function is to hit the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle = __libc_dlopen(shlib_name)</code> loading a new library we control.</p>
<p>Here there are two things to be aware of the first the one mentioned in the article.
If <code>ni-&gt;library</code> is not <code>NULL</code> we will use that pointer in the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle</code> and as ASLR is a bitch we can’t predict a valid pointer without a leak which we don’t have.
Fortunately there is a initial case for this struct where if this is null we set it by <code>ni-&gt;library = nss_new_service (...</code>. Now the multiple null byte write comes in handy!</p>
<p>Then we just need to overflow this struct all the way to it’s name field to change it to an unprivileged library we control.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that we have this next pointer <code>struct service_user *next;</code> inside the struct forming a linked list that will be traversed when the loading happens.
So if we accidentally overflow another <code>service_user</code> struct in the process we will write a garbage pointer if we overflow with fx A’s leading to a seg fault.
This can be circumvented by inserting null bytes in that spot but that creates another problem, we now break the linked list and our target struct could now be completely removed from the list leaving no pointers to it in the entire memory space.</p>
<p>This means that we have to target the first struct in the linked list that comes after our allocated area.
This turned out to be the biggest challenge to overcome as you can imagine this requires pretty good control of the heap allocation.</p>
<p>In the article they target a <code>service_user</code> with the name <code>systemd</code> which we by no means were able to target.
So we set a breakpoint just before the allocation to inspect the linked list. Then we search for <code>systemd</code> and traverse the list backwards until we find the first <code>service_user</code> close to our allocation. (Combined with some trial and error overflowing of A’s to see what struct it crashes on :-))</p>

              <p>DynASM is a preprocessor and tiny runtime library for creating assemblers and JIT compilers in C or C++.</p>
        <p>DynASM was written for, and is maintained as part of, <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>. LuaJIT 1 used
           DynASM in a JIT role. LuaJIT 2 doesn't use DymASM in a JIT role, but LuaJIT 2's interpreter is hand-written in assembly,
           and it uses DynASM as a powerful cross-platform assembler.</p>
        <p>To get the latest copy of DymASM, run the following:</p>
        <pre><span>git clone http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git</span>
<span>cd luajit-2.0/dynasm</span></pre>
        <p>The <a href="http://luajit.org/dynasm.html">official documentation</a> for DynASM is extremely spartan, which can
           make it difficult to get started with DynASM. For using DynASM in a JIT role, this unofficial documentation's
           <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/tutorial.html">tutorial</a></strong> is recommended as a starting point. Once you're more familiar with DynASM,
           the <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/reference.html">reference</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/instructions.html">instruction listing</a></strong>
           pages are recommended reading for fleshing out your DynASM knowledge.</p>
        <p>Note that DynASM supports the x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS instruction sets, but this unofficial documentation
           only covers x86 and x64.</p>

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.
			</p>
			<br>

				</ul>                        
			</div>


		<p>
As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

</p><p>
The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice. 
</p>
<br>

<div><p>
The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better. 
</p>

      <p>Welcome to <em>Exploring FPGA Graphics</em>. In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models. I’ll be writing and revising this series throughout 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>In this first post, we learn how computer displays work and animate simple shapes with an FPGA.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will work. It helps to be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing the designs with two boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/icebreaker/">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/pmod/dvi/">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>The SystemVerilog designs featured in this series are available from the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">projf-explore</a> repo on GitHub. The designs are open source hardware under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick Aside: SystemVerilog?!</strong><br>
We’ll be using a few choice features from SystemVerilog to make Verilog a little more pleasant (no laughing at the back). If you’re familiar with Verilog, you’ll have no trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="space-and-time">Space and Time</h2>
<p>The screen you’re looking at is a little universe with its own rules of space and time.</p>
<p>Looking at a screen from afar, you see a smooth two-dimensional image. Look more closely, and you see many individual blocks: these are <strong>pixels</strong>, made up of red, green, and blue components. A typical high-definition image is 1920 pixels across and 1080 lines down: over 2 million pixels in total. Even a 640x480 image has over 300,000 pixels. The need to handle so much information so quickly is a big part of the challenge of working with graphics at a hardware level.</p>
<p>A VGA cable has five main signals: red, green, blue, horizontal sync, and vertical sync. There are no addressing signals to tell the screen where to draw pixels; the secret is time, defined by the sync signals. The red, green, and blue wires carry the colour of each pixel in turn. Each pixel lasts a fixed length of time; when the display receives a <strong>horizontal sync</strong>, it starts a new line; when it receives a <strong>vertical sync</strong>, it begins a new frame. Showing many frames in quick succession provides the illusion of a moving image.</p>
<p>The sync signals are part of <strong>blanking</strong> intervals. Originally designed to allow an electron gun to move to the next line or top of the screen, blanking intervals have been retained and repurposed in contemporary displays: HDMI uses them to transmit audio. The blanking interval has three parts: <strong>front porch</strong>, <strong>sync</strong>, and <strong>back porch</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://projectf.io/img/posts/fpga-graphics/display-timings.png" alt="Display Timings" title="Display Timings"></p>
<h2 id="display-timings">Display Timings</h2>
<p>In this series, we’re going to use <strong>640x480</strong> as our display resolution. Almost all displays support 640x480, and its low resource requirements make it simple to work with on small FPGAs. All the same principles apply at higher resolutions, such as 1280x720 or 4K.</p>
<p>We’ll use traditional horizontal and vertical timings, based on the original VGA monitor and adapter:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">    640x480 Timings      HOR    VER
    -------------------------------
    Active Pixels        640    480
    Front Porch           16     10
    Sync Width            96      2
    Back Porch            48     33
    Blanking Total       160     45
    Total Pixels         800    525
    Sync Polarity        neg    neg
</code></pre></div><p><em>Learn more from <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/video-timings-vga-720p-1080p/">Video Timings: VGA, SVGA, 720p, 1080p</a>.</em></p>
<p>Taking blanking into account, we have a total of 800x525 pixels. A typical LCD refreshes 60 times a second, so the number of pixels per second is <code>800 x 525 x 60 = 25,200,000</code>, which equates to a <strong>pixel clock</strong> of 25.2 MHz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CAUTION: CRT Monitors</strong><br>
Any modern display, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisync_monitor">multisync CRTs</a>, should be fine with a 25.2 or 25 MHz pixel clock. Fixed-frequency CRTs, such as the original IBM 85xx series, could be damaged by an out-of-spec signal. Use these designs at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-to-time">Running to Time</h2>
<p>We’ve decided we need a pixel clock of 25.2 MHz pixel clock, but neither of our demo boards has such a clock. To reach the required frequency, we’re going to use a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase-locked loop</a></strong> (PLL). Almost all FPGAs include one or more PLLs, but there isn’t a standard way to configure them in Verilog, so we have to use vendor-specific designs.</p>
<p>We have provided implementations for Xilinx 7 Series (XC7) and Lattice iCE40; for other FPGAs, you’ll need to consult your vendor documentation. If you can’t reach 25.2 MHz exactly, then 25 MHz or thereabouts should be fine (but see note about CRTs, above). The iCE40 can’t generate 25.2 MHz using the oscillators on iCEBreaker but works fine at 25.125 MHz.</p>

<p>Using our ~25 MHz pixel clock, we can generate timings for our 640x480 display. Creating display timings is straightforward: there’s one counter for horizontal position and one for vertical. We use these counters to decide on the correct time for sync signals.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><em>ProTip: The last assignment wins in Verilog, so the reset overrides the existing <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code>.</em></p>
<p><strong>sx</strong> and <strong>sy</strong> store the horizontal and vertical position; their maximum values are 800 and 525 respectively, so we need 10 bits to hold them (2<sup>10</sup> = 1024). <strong>de</strong> is <em>data enable</em>, which is low during the blanking interval: we use it to decide when to draw pixels.</p>
<p>Display modes vary in the polarity of their sync signals; for traditional 640x480, the polarity is negative for both <strong>hsync</strong> and <strong>vsync</strong>. Negative polarity means the voltage is mostly high, with low voltage indicating a sync signal.</p>
<p>The following simulation shows the vertical sync starting at the 490th line (counting starts at zero):</p>

<p>Some things to check:</p>

<li>What is the pixel clock period?</li>
<li>How long does the pixel clock take to lock?</li>
<li>Does a frame last exactly 1/60th of a second?</li>
<li>How much time does a single line last?</li>

<p>Now we have our display signals we’re ready to start drawing. To begin, we’re going to keep it simple and draw a coloured square. When the screen x and y coordinates are both less than 32 we draw in orange; otherwise, we use blue. Because our colour output has 4 bits per channel, we can use a single hex digit from 0-F to represent the intensity of red, green, and blue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc on OpenBSD</h2>

	<p><small>February  1, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the unusual things about <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is that
it started out with the approach of directly making system calls
on Unix, instead of calling the standard C library functions that
correspond to those system calls. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoCLibraryAPIIssues">There are reasonably good reasons
for Go to make direct system calls</a> and this
works well on Linux, but other Unixes are different. The official
API for Illumos and Solaris system calls requires you to use their
C library, and OpenBSD wants you to do this as well for security
reasons (for <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/">OpenBSD system call origin verification</a>). Go has used the C library on
Solaris and Illumos for a long time, but through Go 1.15 it made
direct system calls on OpenBSD and so current released versions of
OpenBSD had a special exemption from their system call origin
verification because of it.</p>

<p>The news of the time interval for Go 1.16 is that this is changing. To
quote from the current draft release notes (which are probably soon to
be the official release notes):</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM architectures on OpenBSD (the
<code>openbsd/amd64</code> and <code>openbsd/arm64</code> ports), system calls are now
made through <code>libc</code>, instead of directly using the <code>SYSCALL/SVC</code>
instruction. This ensures forward-compatibility with future versions
of OpenBSD. In particular, OpenBSD 6.9 onwards will require system
calls to be made through <code>libc</code> for non-static Go binaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, Go programs that look up host names or do a few other
operations are very likely to not be statically linked. You can force
static linking (and you'll normally get it if you cross-build), but it
has some drawbacks for hostname lookups in some configurations and you
can't do some other operations at all.</p>

<p>At one level everything is okay with this situation. OpenBSD 6.9 will
almost certainly include Go 1.16 in its ports collection, since it will
be the only version of Go that works on it, and from there you can build
Go programs that will run fine on 6.9. At another level, any dynamically
linked Go program you have will need to be rebuilt with Go 1.16 before
you can run it on OpenBSD 6.9. Hopefully you have the source code and
can still build it (in what will be a 'modular by default' world in Go
1.16). This is nothing really new for OpenBSD, which has always made it
clear that they don't promise ABI or even API compatibility; you always
need to be prepared to rebuild your programs for new OpenBSD versions,
and perhaps to update them to more secure APIs.</p>

<p>(Statically linked Go programs built by Go 1.15 or earlier will likely
keep working on OpenBSD 6.9, assuming that there are no other ABI
changes that affect them. But you should probably plan to rebuild them
with Go 1.16 just to be sure. I don't know what the situation will be
if you want to create Go binaries that work across a range of OpenBSD
versions.)</p>

<p>As the release notes say, Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc
for all programs, whether they're dynamically linked or statically
linked. Right now OpenBSD only requires this for dynamically linked
programs (well, will require it), but always calling via libc is simpler
than to maintain two sets of system call code. And someday OpenBSD may
do something more elaborate so that making system calls via libc is
required even for statically linked programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 2015, I discovered a surprising security vulnerability that allowed you to run malicious JavaScript code on the Google search engine results page, which might be one of the most secure pages on the internet given how much daily traffic it recieves. It wasn’t until <a href="#the-fix">4 years later (or 2019) that they finally closed the case on it</a> and I could share it without breaking my nondisclosure agreement with Google.</p><p>This sounds like a lot like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS attack</a>, which you would imagine Google would sanitize for, but it’s not and it’ll soon become clear why as I explain.</p><p>I was on Google searching for something like <em>“text-to-speech javascript libraries”</em>. I went from the Google search results page to clicking the first result, back to the Google search results page, to clicking on the second result, back to the Google search results page, etc. What I noticed was that my speakers kept making a clicking noise, like they were turning on and off—but just for a second.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/google-search.png" loading="lazy" width="340"></figure><p>I thought maybe there was some other program running on my computer or that my speakers were busted, but I realized it happened everytime I went to the Google search results page for this query. It also happened everytime I went to the first search results page, which was of a company that had a demo of their text-to-speech solution on it.</p><p>I figured the company’s page was loading their text-to-speech engine, that seemed to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">SpeechSynthesis interface of the WebSpeech API</a>, and that’s why the speakers were turning on. But why were they on the Google page? That seemed like Google was maybe pulling in code on the search results page from the company’s page. That should never happen though, surely Google sanitizes anything that ever gets displayed on their pages from containing HTML or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>This seemed like a plausible attack vector if there was some bug that allowed you to bring arbitrary code on to the Google search results page and a huge one at that.</p><p>I dumped the source code of the search results page and started looking at the HTML around the search result, but it didn’t look like any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or HTML tags were making it through. I started looking for instances of the company’s domain and found something like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"prerender"</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://thecompanyspage.com/example"</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I was not familiar with <code>rel="prerender"</code> myself in 2015. Indeed, it seemed to be some sort of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-resource-hints-20150717/#dfn-prerender">new mechanism for pre-fetching and pre-loading a page</a> to speed up page transistions and load times as an optimization.</p><p>Google seemed to have invented <code>rel="prerender"</code> to prefetch and load the first search result in the background, so that when you clicked on the first search result (as most users do), it would instantly be ready for viewing.</p><p>The <code>rel="prerender"</code> has to execute JavaScript to load dynamic content, but it wasn’t blocking the WebSpeech API from playing audio possibly. Luckily for Google, the pre-rendered content is loaded in its own origin and, therefore, sensitive resources like cookies on the Google page were not at risk from being harvested by attackers like they would be in an XSS attack.</p><p>After learning this, the next step was to prove this out with my own website on Google’s search results page and see what I could make of it.</p><p>I needed a long obscure phrase that I could get the #1 Google search result spot for and that no one would accidently stumble upon so I could keep the vulnerability relatively secret until Google could fix it. I chose the apt phrase “Alphabet Spoke to Me In My Dreams” and purchased the <code>alphabetspoketomeinmydreams.xyz</code> domain name (now expired) that would show up as the first Google search result for the phrase. This was around the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/technology/google-alphabet-restructuring.html">Google restructured into Alphabet Inc</a>.</p><p>The first malicious thing I could think to do was to “vandalize” the Google search results page with one of those “win a prize” scams pretending to be Google to phish their users. I also thought it would be sufficiently creepy to show how you were able to access standard information about the user like their location, ISP, IP address while being prerendered and speak it back to them. I know <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/iZ6bamP8wZk?t=46">Dwight Schrute would be scared of that</a>.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFlquq0GcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio on the Google search results page.</figcaption></figure><p>So this looks pretty bad, but you would think that a user might notice if they click on the first result that it was a 3rd-party page causing the audio to play not Google right? Yes, except you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hidden"><code>document.hidden</code> property</a> to detect prerender mode and condition your code so that it only runs in <code>rel="prerender"</code> mode on the Google search engine results page! This creates a pretty robust appearance for impersonation as nothing happens if you go to the page directly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.hidden) {
  <span>// The page is being loaded in rel="prerender", run the WebSpeech API code
</span><span></span>} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The page is being loaded normally, don't do anything
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="chrome-vulnerability">Chrome Vulnerability</h2><p>While testing this, I found that this doesn’t only work on the Google search results page, but it turns out Chrome also “prerenders” the first result of the autocomplete in the URL search bar. Therefore, you can start playing WebSpeech audio without even having a page loaded in the browser frame.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqyOnzGDRlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Chrome Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio in the Chrome browser before any page is loaded in the browser at all when triggered by a user typing in a search into the URL search bar.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="denial-of-service-possibilities">Denial-of-Service Possibilities</h2><p>After testing other APIs, it seemed clear that only the WebSpeech API was making it through to the parent page. Things like <code>alert()</code> boxes were deferred from being visible until the page was actually loaded. But it also seemed clear that, while certain APIs were not available, JavaScript was running unrestricted. What happens if you do an infinite loop on the prerendered page?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>while</span> (<span>true</span>) {
  <span>// Infinite loop
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, you could “denial of service” the Google search results page from being displayed. This is not an attack on their servers, but rather you lock up the user’s browser so Google’s search results page cannot load.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/dos.png" loading="lazy" alt="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" title="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" width="600"><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service</span>
Preventing the Google search results page from even loading by infinite looping in the prerendered page.</figcaption></figure><p>I shared the live example and a locally reproducible example of the vulnerability to Google.</p><h2 id="googles-response">Google’s Response</h2><p>Google’s security team responded promptly and professionally within 24 hours and decided to award a monetary reward for the vulnerability. The Chrome team did not dual-award since Google had already awarded. The Chrome team, however, were responsible for fixing the issue. I was not able to share this bug for quite some time due to the nondisclosure terms of Google’s vulnerability program.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2><p>The bug report and discussion is now public and visible <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=520275">here</a>.</p><p>I was suprised at how long it took to resolve and how difficult the fix seemed to be. It proved very difficult to break this API out from being enabled in the prerender context. In fact, at one point, one of the developers mentioned: <em>“This is currently our oldest &gt;= Medium severity security bug."</em> It was not until 2019 that they finally closed the bug after prerendering support was completely dropped from Chrome, due to it causing headaches like this, and the proof-of-concept could no longer be reproduced.</p><p>So, it seems premature optimization like <code>rel="prerender"</code> being the root of all evil isn’t just true because you might spend time <a href="https://xkcd.com/1691/">optimizing something that isn’t worth it</a>, but also because it likely increases the complexity and surface area for serious security bugs.</p></div></div>]]>

The formation of this new super-city doubled Berlin’s population from 1.9 million to what was, at the time, a staggering 3.9 million people, making it the world’s fifth-largest city after Tokyo.</p><p>While it is far from unusual to see major world cities expand and contract over time, as well as for the major cities of past eras to be overtaken by the new megacities of Asia, Africa, and South America, it is practically unheard of for a city on the scale of Berlin to be smaller in 2020 than it was 100 years before. The catastrophic destruction of WWII and the Battle of Berlin, which caused the population to plummet back to nearly its pre-Groß-Berlin level, also brought about the conditions that would keep the population low well into the following century. The crushing geopolitical gravity generated by Berlin’s position at the heart of the Cold War acted as a colossal reduction gear, stifling growth in both the Western and Eastern sectors of the city as each side threw all available resources into countering the advances of the other.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_131865"><div>

This cyclical progression informs both the subject matter and the overarching structure of <strong><em>Unfinished Metropolis</em></strong>, a monumental new 2-volume work from Berlin’s Dom Publishers. The book accompanies the exhibition of the same name (“Unvollendete Metropole”; info at end of article), and takes a many-faceted view of Berlin, starting with an examination of the newly-unified Groß-Berlin, a unification that only happened, unsurprisingly (and much like the BER Airport debacle of the 21st century) after decades of conflict and barely-there consensus. As the introduction points out, Greater Berlin has spent the majority of its existence outside of democratic rule:</p><p><em>Greater Berlin was not ruled by democratically elected governments for many years of its history. It was only governed democratically in the period from 1920 to 1933 and then again more recently since 1990. The Greater Berlin project has suffered many setbacks. The city is an incomplete project.</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_145993"><div>

In a remarkable cartoon that compresses the curvature of the earth from Rome through Dresden and Berlin and beyond, reminiscent of Saul Steinberg’s “View of the World from 9th Avenue”, it even cast the Axis of WWII phantasmagorically onto the curvature of the earth. More frequently, though, its perspective zooms <em>in</em> on a staggering array of Berlin neighborhoods and city centers (Berlin’s paradoxical nature as a city with numerous “centers” is a recurring theme in the book), from lasting “centers” like Alexanderplatz and Zoologischer Garten to outlying districts like Friedenau in the West and Marzahn in the East, as well as yet more microscopic examinations of plazas, parks, and even specific artworks.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_154562"><div>

While such a vast array of maps might seem overwhelming, their overall effect is, paradoxically, one of greater focus. The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme. Berlin has spent the past century proving itself to be one of the world’s most unmappable cities (from a conventional perspective), with monumental buildings constructed and razed to the ground within decades – and, in the case of the Stadtschloß, built up again. The city has seen whole neighborhoods built, destroyed, and rebuilt, streets changing names from decade to decade, and of course its 30-year stint as two divided cities.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h3><em>The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme</em></h3></blockquote><p>True to its cyclical take on Berlin’s history, the book favors a thematic progression over a chronological one, moving backwards and forwards in history, from the 1920s (and even earlier) right up to bleeding-edge current events like COVID-19, the new BER Airport, and the still-under-construction Tesla Gigafactory. While current mayor Michael Müller provides an introductory text, the true “host” of the book is <strong>Gustav Böß</strong>, mayor of Greater Berlin from 1921 to 1929. Böß possesses not only a far-reaching futurism – “Urban development should never be driven by current needs, but rather by how it will meet future needs” – but also a timeless weariness appropriate to anyone who has attempted to obtain a consensus in the cranky, contentious politics of Berlin. His words written in the 1920s resonate prophetically over the next century’s worth of maps, documents, and photographs, and introduce each major new thematic section, from Berlin’s rail network to its roads and streets to the issue of its numerous “centers”.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_150290"><div>

This companion volume documents the “International Urban Planning Competition for Berlin-Brandenburg 2070”, where competitors sought to present comprehensive visions for the next 50 years. The competition, as well as Volume Two itself, take an international view of city planning, looking abroad to other European capitals from London to Paris to Moscow. The text offers ample historical context for each city covered, ultimately highlighting the ways in which Berlin’s challenges are either different from – or, more frequently, surprisingly similar to – those of other cities.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_141204"><div>
