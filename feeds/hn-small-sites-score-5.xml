							<p>TL;DR: If you have a Zyxel USG, ATP, VPN, ZyWALL or USG FLEX you should update to the latest firmware version today. You can find the full list of affected devices <a href="https://businessforum.zyxel.com/discussion/5252/zld-v4-60-revoke-and-wk48-firmware-release">here</a> and the Zyxel advisory <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/support/CVE-2020-29583.shtml">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>Zyxel is a popular brand for firewalls that are marketed towards small and medium businesses. Their Unified Security Gateway (USG) product line is often used as a firewall or VPN gateway. As a lot of us are working from home, VPN-capable devices have been quite selling well lately.</p>
                            <p>When doing some research (rooting) on my Zyxel USG40, I was surprised to find a user account 'zyfwp' with a password hash in the latest firmware version (4.60 patch 0). The plaintext password was visible in one of the binaries on the system. I was even more surprised that this account seemed to work on both the SSH and web interface.</p>
                            <pre>$ ssh <a href="https://www.eyecontrol.nl/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4832312e3f380879717a66797e706679667a7d7a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
Password: Pr*******Xp
Router&gt; show users current
No: 1
  Name: zyfwp
  Type: admin
(...)
Router&gt;</pre>
                            <p>The user is not visible in the interface and its password cannot be changed. I checked the previous firmware version (4.39) and although the user was present, it did not have a password. It seemed the vulnerability had been introduced in the latest firmware version. Even though older versions do not have this vulnerability, they do have others (such as this <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/us/en/support/Zyxel-security-advisory-for-buffer-overflow-vulnerability.shtml">buffer overflow</a>) so you should still update.</p>
                            <p>As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface, a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar, I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally, more than 100.000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet.</p>
                            <p>In our experience, most users of these devices will not update the firmware very often. Zyxel devices do not expose their firmware version to unauthenticated users, so determining if a device is vulnerable is a bit more difficult. We wanted to get an idea of the amount of affected devices, but simply trying the password is not really an option (ethically and legally). Luckily, some javascript and css files can be requested from the web interface of these devices without authentication. These files seem to change with every firmware release. Using this information, we can obtain a unique fingerprint of the vulnerable firmware version. We used this information to identify the firmware version of 1.000 devices in The Netherlands and found that around 10% of devices are running the affected firmware version. Zyxel does offer automatic updates, but these are not enabled by default. Luckily, we were able to find this vulnerability just a few weeks after it had been introduced, or the number of affected devices could have been much larger.</p>
                            <p>As the zyfwp user has admin privileges, this is a serious vulnerability. An attacker could completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the device. Someone could for example change firewall settings to allow or block certain traffic. They could also intercept traffic or create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device.  Combined with a vulnerability like Zerologon this could be devastating to small and medium businesses.</p>
                            <p>Because of the seriousness of the vulnerability and it being so easy to exploit, we have decided not to release the password for this account at this time. We do expect others to find and release it, which is why we suggest you install the updated firmware as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>I quickly sent out a mail to Zyxel to report the undocumented user account. According to Zyxel, the account was designed to deliver automatic firmware updates for access points via FTP. They released a fixed firmware version less than two weeks later. You can find the release notes for the USG40 <a href="ftp://ftp.zyxel.com/USG40/firmware/USG40_4.60(AALA.1)C0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>This is the entry in the release notes that describes this vulnerability:</p>
                            <pre>[BUG FIX][CVE-2020-29583]
a. Vulnerability fix for undocumented user account.</pre>
                            <p>We would like to thank the Zyxel Security Team for their quick response and patch.</p>

You want objects. You want polymorphism. You want concurrency. You want garbage collection. Wait you don’t want GC? Okay, no worries, we won’t do that :P</p><p>If you’ve just joined the series at this stage, here’s a quick recap. We’re designing a Java-esque concurrent object-oriented programming language <em>Bolt</em>. We’ve gone through the compiler frontend, where we’ve done the parsing, type-checking and dataflow analysis. We’ve <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/">desugared our language to get it ready for LLVM</a> - the main takeaway is that objects have been desugared to structs, and their methods desugared to functions.</p><p>Learn about LLVM and you’ll be the envy of your friends. Rust uses LLVM for its backend, so it must be cool. You’ll beat them on all those performance benchmarks, without having to hand-optimise your code or write machine assembly code. Shhhh, I won’t tell them.</p><h2 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h2><p>All the code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt compiler repository</a>.</p><p>The C++ class definitions for our desugared representation (we call this <em>Bolt IR</em>) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/deserialise_ir">deserialise_ir</a> folder. The code for this post (the LLVM IR generation) can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/llvm_ir_codegen">llvm_ir_codegen</a> folder. The repo uses the Visitor design pattern and ample use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make memory management easier.</p><p>To cut through the boilerplate, to find out how to generate LLVM IR for a particular language expression, search for the <code>IRCodegenVisitor::codegen</code> method that takes in the corresponding <code>ExprIR</code> object. e.g. for if-else statements:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>Value </span><span>*</span><span>IRCodegenVisitor</span><span>::</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIfElseIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="understanding-llvm-ir"><a href="#understanding-llvm-ir" aria-label="understanding llvm ir permalink"></a>Understanding LLVM IR</h2><p>LLVM sits in the <strong>middle-end</strong> of our compiler, <em>after</em> we’ve desugared our language features, but <em>before</em> the backends that target specific machine architectures (x86, ARM etc.)</p><p>LLVM’s IR is pretty low-level, it can’t contain language features present in some languages but not others (e.g. classes are present in C++ but not C). If you’ve come across instruction sets before, LLVM IR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#:~:text=A%20reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer,instruction%20set%20computer%20(CISC).">RISC</a> instruction set.</p><p>The upshot of it is that LLVM IR looks like a more <em>readable</em> form of assembly. As LLVM IR is <strong>machine independent</strong>, we don’t need to worry about the number of registers, size of datatypes, calling conventions or other machine-specific details.</p><p>So instead of a fixed number of physical registers, in LLVM IR we have an unlimited set of <em>virtual</em> registers (labelled <code>%0</code>, <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, <code>%3</code>… we can write and read from. It’s the backend’s job to map from virtual to physical registers.</p><p>And rather than allocating specific sizes of datatypes, we retain <strong>types</strong> in LLVM IR. Again, the backend will take this type information and map it to the size of the datatype. LLVM has types for different sizes of <code>int</code>s and floats, e.g. <code>int32</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int1</code> etc. It also has derived types: like <strong>pointer</strong> types, <strong>array</strong> types, <strong>struct</strong> types, <strong>function</strong> types. To find out more, check out the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html">Type</a> documentation.</p><p>Now, built into LLVM are a set of optimisations we can run over the LLVM IR e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-common-subexpr.html">common subexpression elimination</a> etc. The details of these algorithms are irrelevant: LLVM implements them for us.</p><p>Our side of the bargain is that we write LLVM IR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static Single Assignment (SSA) form</a>, as SSA form makes life easier for optimisation writers. SSA form sounds fancy, but it just means we define variables before use and assign to variables <strong>only once</strong>. In SSA form, we cannot reassign to a variable, e.g. <code>x = x+1</code>; instead we assign to a fresh variable each time (<code>x2 = x1 + 1</code>).</p><p>So in short: LLVM IR looks like assembly with <strong>types</strong>, minus the messy machine-specific details. LLVM IR must be in SSA form, which makes it easier to optimise.

Now you’ve seen the diagrams that define modules, functions and basic blocks, the relationship between their corresponding classes in the API falls out nicely. You can query a <code>Module</code> object to get a list of its <code>Function</code> objects, and query a <code>Function</code> to get the list of its <code>BasicBlock</code>s, and the other way round: you can query a <code>BasicBlock</code> to get its parent <code>Function</code> object.</p><p><code>Value</code> is the base class for any value computed by the program. This could be a function (<code>Function</code> subclasses <code>Value</code>), a basic block (<code>BasicBlock</code> also subclasses <code>Value</code>), an instruction, or the result of an intermediate computation.</p><p>Each of the expression <code>codegen</code> methods returns a <code>Value *</code>: the result of executing that expression.

<p>The Raspberry Pi family of devices is a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They are all based on Broadcom System-on-a-chip (SOCs). 
</p>


<h2><span id="Status"></span>Status</h2>
<p>Only the <i>Raspberry Pi 3 Family</i> is supported upstream, with the AArch64 effort.
</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 4B is not <em>supported</em> by NixOS, though a beta-quality disk image specific for it is produced. It will be supported the same as the Pi 3 family once the mainline kernel and mainline U-Boot boot fine through the generic mainline image.
</p><p>Other Raspberry Pis (0, 1, and 2) are part of diverse community porting efforts to ARMv6 and ARMv7.
</p><p>The Linux kernel in use, except for the Raspberry Pi 1 family, is the mainline Linux kernel, and not the Raspberry Pi Foundation's fork. This could reduce compatibility with some add-on boards or third-party libraries<sup>[expanded explanation needed]</sup>.
</p><p>The following table is intended to be updated by the NixOS contributors with the current status of the boards. For a list of products, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">see the <i>Products Archive</i></a>.

<h2><span id="Notes_about_the_boot_process"></span>Notes about the boot process</h2>
<p>The custom bootloader, part of the Raspberry Pi firmware, is abstracted away for NixOS by making it boot U-Boot instead.
</p><p>U-Boot gives us the ability to provide a generation selection menu during the boot process, in addition to storing the boot files on the main partition, rather than on the firmware partition.
</p>
<h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_.28all_versions.29"></span>Raspberry Pi (all versions)</h3>
<p>USB keyboards and HDMI displays should work, though some issues have been reported (see Troubleshooting below).
</p><p>Using the 3.3v serial port via the pin headers (exact location depends on hardware version) will get u-boot output and, when configured, a Linux kernel console.
</p>
<h2><span id="Troubleshooting"></span>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3><span id="Power_issues"></span>Power issues</h3>
<p>Especially with the newer power-hungry Raspberry Pi families (3, 4), it is important to have a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md">sufficient enough power supply</a> or <i>weirdness</i> may happen. Weirdness may include:
</p>
<ul><li> Lightning bolt on HDMI output "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> Screen switching back to u-boot text
<ul><li> Fixable temporarily when power is sufficient by switching VT (alt+F2 / alt+F1)</li></ul></li>
<li> Random hangs</li></ul>
<p>This problem is a hard problem. It is caused by the Raspberry Pi warning about power issues, but the current drivers (as of 
Linux 4.14) have a hard time dealing with it properly. If the power supply is rated properly AND the cable is not incurring too much power losses, it may be required to disable the lightning bolt indicator so the display driver isn't messed up.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The lightning bolt indicator can be disabled by adding the line <code>avoid_warnings=1</code> in config.txt<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p><strong> Note: </strong>A <i>properly rated</i> USB power supply, AND a good cable are necessary. The cable has to be short enough to not incur power losses through the length. Do note that thin and cheap cables usually have thinner copper wires, which in turn accentuates power losses.</p>

</figure><h3><strong>Dead Alien Civilization </strong></h3><p>The researchers behind this study, Xiang Cai, Jonathan H. Jiang, Kristen A. Fahy, and Yuk L. Yung, explained in the paper that "if intelligent life is likely to destroy themselves, it is not surprising that there is little or no intelligent life elsewhere".</p><p>If people are wondering why humans, the most intelligent living being on planet Earth and on the solar system, might still be alive, it is because the species are billions of years behind these now-extinct alien civilizations. The intelligent species or aliens probably noticed life form around eight billion years after the formation of the Milky Way, whereas humans did not reach until 13.5 billion years after the creation. This means the humans are almost over five billion years behind.</p><p>According to Jiang, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory astrophysicist, since Carl Sagan's time, there has been lots of research on alien life, especially when the Hubble Space Telescope and Kepler Space Telescope were created. "We have lots of knowledge about the densities in the Milky Way galaxy and star formation rates and exoplanet formation...and the occurrence rate of supernova explosions. We actually know some of the numbers," he <a href="https://www.livescience.com/milky-way-alien-life-map.html" rel="nofollow">added</a>.</p>

</figure><p>The numbers are actually related to the mystery variables that the American astronomer and the planetary scientist Segan referred to in his Cosmos miniseries in which he discussed the Drake equation. This formula proposed by American astrophysicist Frank Drake estimates N, the number of transmitting societies in the Milky Way galaxy. It is actually the equation that may give the scientists an idea about how many alien societies exist and are detectable.</p><p>Because of the scientific limitations at that time, Drake and Sagan included variables that could not be identified more precisely. But now Jiang and the team of scientists have learned about some of those numbers which Drake and Segan failed to identify. The paper says when and where life is most likely to flourish in the Milky Way and it identifies the most important factor affecting its prevalence that is intelligent creatures' tendency toward self-annihilation.</p><p>Understanding the factors helped the team of scientists believe that advanced alien civilizations did exist at one point in the galaxy, but they likely destroyed themselves by way of progress. However, according to some scientific theories, there might be <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/there-might-be-36-alien-races-in-the-milky-way" rel="nofollow">36</a> extraterrestrial races among the stars.</p><p>Earlier in 2018, scientists claimed that the galaxy used to be the home to aliens but it was the effect of climate change that vanished all the life forms, as per a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/12/31/galaxy-may-be-littered-with-dead-aliens-blindsided-by-natural-climate-change/?sh=497bde101955" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> from Forbes. In the recently released paper, the researchers said, "The simulated age distributions also suggest that most of the intelligent life in our galaxy are young, thus making observation or detection difficult."</p><p>They also found that even if the galaxy reached its civilizational peak over five billion years ago, most of the civilizations that were around that time have likely self-annihilated. However, the paper has been submitted to a journal for publication and it is currently awaiting peer review.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Some of my friends have been telling me that Windows machines got a lot better. I decided to give it a try, and bought a top of the line Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 8. For all of you thinking about doing the same switch, you might want to read this first.</p>

<p>Even though Apple is known for overpricing, and taking advantage of their customer base, they do it in a larger scheme of things, and do not engage in business practices which have a low customer experience. Unfortunately, you can’t say the same about the Lenovo universe.</p>

<p>Just go to their <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/">website</a> for a minute. Try to figure out which Laptop to buy, without getting the feeling you are being scammed. Everything seems to be on sale all the time, there are laptops of different generations of the same product line being advertised to you. They lie to your face about the battery life-times. People who are buying these machines got used to this experience, and are proud of being able to navigate such websites. You really need to do your homework before buying anything.</p>

<p>For example: I bought the X1 with their standard FHD screen, and it feels older than my 7 years old MBP. When trying to figure out why, I found out that Lenovo has a “<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-Panel-Lottery-continues-with-3-different-14-inch-LowPower-displays.426538.0.html">panel lottery</a>”: They use different suppliers with remarkable quality differences for their displays. Which one you get is just based on luck. Turns out the panel I got is the same they use for their cheapest product line. This means I have a ghosting mouse pointer on a $2000 brand new machine. Nice.</p>

<p>Even if you are lucky with the screen: it does not come color calibrated out of the box! Good luck trying to find the correct color profile, unless you want to spend money on a calibration tool you’re only going to use once.
Then comes Windows:</p>

<p>Yeah, it got better, but wow, do they carry a lot of baggage around. When trying to calibrate the display I found out that Windows has no less than three different system configuration UIs, which are also intertwined in unexpected ways. On top of that Lenovo installed their own buggy configuration tool. Configuring Windows feels like walking on ice. Even with all this configuration might, it still was not possible to get the exact serial number of my display panel without installing a third party tool.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also constantly nagging you about something that marginally helps their bottom line, but costs you a lot of your user experience. Like their constant push to trick people into giving them their data, or the fact that they try to force you to use their browser whenever they can.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure if I ticked the right boxes so that Microsoft does not get my browsing behaviour. I feel stressed every time Microsoft wants something from me. How are they trying to scam me this time?</p>

<p>For me this reinforces my belief that people who like Windows are simply used to it, because they need it for work or playing games. There is no point arguing with this, as their added value is their own experience, and the fact they know the tools and tricks to make the system usable to them.</p>

<p>One friend even told me that one of his favourite improvements in newer Windows versions is that they made it a lot easier to completely reset the operation system. My Apple machine has never been reset since I bought it almost a decade ago, and works flawlessly.  His statement seems like a subtle warning as to what is expecting me in the near future using my new  machine.</p>

<p>Our newsletter API is live, hosted on a Cloud provider.<br>
We have a basic set of instrumentation to troubleshoot issues that might arise.<br>
There is an exposed endpoint (<code>POST /subscriptions</code>) to subscribe to our content.</p>
<p>We have come a long way!</p>
<p>But we have cut a few corners along the way: <code>POST /subscriptions</code> is fairly... permissive.<br>
Our input validation is extremely limited: we just ensure that both the name and the email fields are provided, nothing else.</p>
<p>We can add a new integration test to probe our API with some "troublesome" inputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]

</span><span>#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_200_when_fields_are_present_but_empty</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// Arrange
    </span><span>let</span><span> app = </span><span>spawn_app</span><span>().await;
    </span><span>let</span><span> client = reqwest::Client::new();
    </span><span>let</span><span> test_cases = vec![
        ("</span><span>name=&amp;email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com</span><span>", "</span><span>empty name</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=</span><span>", "</span><span>empty email</span><span>"),
        ("</span><span>name=Ursula&amp;email=definitely-not-an-email</span><span>", "</span><span>invalid email</span><span>"),
    ];

    </span><span>for </span><span>(body, description) in test_cases {
        </span><span>// Act
        </span><span>let</span><span> response = client
            .</span><span>post</span><span>(&amp;format!("</span><span>{}</span><span>/subscriptions</span><span>", &amp;app.address))
            .</span><span>header</span><span>("</span><span>Content-Type</span><span>", "</span><span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span><span>")
            .</span><span>body</span><span>(body)
            .</span><span>send</span><span>()
            .await
            .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Failed to execute request.</span><span>");

        </span><span>// Assert
        </span><span>assert_eq!(
            </span><span>200</span><span>,
            response.</span><span>status</span><span>().</span><span>as_u16</span><span>(),
            "</span><span>The API did not return a 200 OK when the payload was {}.</span><span>",
            description 
        );
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The new test, unfortunately, passes.<br>
Although all those payloads are clearly invalid, our API is gladly accepting them, returning a <code>200 OK</code>.<br>
Those troublesome subscriber details end up straight in our database, ready to give us problems down the line when it is time to deliver a newsletter issue.</p>
<p>We are asking for two pieces of information when subscribing to our newsletter: a name and an email.<br>
This chapter will focus on name validation: what should we look out for?</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="1-1-domain-constraints">1.1. Domain Constraints</h2>
<p>It turns out that names are complicated<sup><a href="#patio-names">1</a></sup>.<br>
Trying to nail down what makes a name <em>valid</em> is a fool's errand. Remember that we chose to collect a name to use it in the opening line of our emails - we do not need it to match the real identity of a person, whatever that means in their geography. It would be totally unnecessary to inflict the pain of incorrect or overly prescriptive validation on our users.</p>
<p>We could thus settle on simply requiring the name field to be non-empty (as in, it must contain at least a non-whitespace character).</p>
<h2 id="1-2-security-constraints">1.2. Security Constraints</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not all people on the Internet are good people.<br>
Given enough time, especially if our newsletter picks up traction and becomes successful, we are bound to capture the attention of malicious visitors.<br>
Forms and user inputs are a primary attack target - if they are not properly sanitised, they might allow an attacker to mess with our database (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>), execute code on our servers, crash our service and other nasty stuff.<br>
Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>What is likely to happen in our case? What should we brace for in the wild range of possible attacks?<sup><a href="#threat-modelling">2</a></sup><br>
We are building an email newsletter, which leads us to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>denial of service - e.g. trying to take our service down to prevent other people from signing up. A common threat for basically any online service;</li>
<li>data theft - e.g. steal a huge list of email addresses;</li>
<li>phishing - e.g. use our service to send what looks like a legitimate email to a victim to trick them into clicking on some links or perform other actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we try to tackle all these threats in our validation logic?<br>
Absolutely not!<br>
But it is good practice to have a layered security approach<sup><a href="#defense-in-depth">3</a></sup>: by having mitigations to reduce the risk for those threats at multiple levels in our stack (e.g. input validation, parametrised queries to avoid SQL injection, escaping parametrised input in emails, etc.) we are less likely to be vulnerable should any of those checks fail us or be removed later down the line.</p>
<p>We should always keep in mind that software is a living artifact: holistic understanding of a system is the first victim of the passage of time.<br>
You have the whole system in your head when writing it down for the first time, but the next developer touching it will not - at least not from the get-go. It is therefore possible for a load-bearing check in an obscure corner of the application to disappear (e.g. HTML escaping) leaving you exposed to a class of attacks (e.g. phishing).<br>
Redundancy reduces risk.</p>
<p>Let's get to the point - what validation should we perform on names to improve our security posture given the class of threats we identified?<br>
I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforcing a maximum length. We are using <code>TEXT</code> as type for our email in Postgres, which is virtually unbounded - well, until disk storage starts to run out. Names come in all shapes and forms, but 256 characters should be enough for the greatest majority of our users<sup><a href="#longest-name">4</a></sup> - if not, we will politely ask them to enter a nickname.</li>
<li>Reject names containing troublesome characters. <code>/()"&lt;&gt;\{}</code> are fairly common in URLs, SQL queries and HTML fragments - not as much in names<sup><a href="#xkcd">5</a></sup>. Forbidding them raises the complexity bar for SQL injection and phishing attempts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's have a look at our request handler, as it stands right now:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, HttpResponse};
</span><span>use </span><span>chrono::Utc;
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::PgPool;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;

#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(serde::Deserialize)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>FormData {
    </span><span>email</span><span>: String,
    </span><span>name</span><span>: String,
}

#[</span><span>tracing</span><span>::</span><span>instrument</span><span>(
    name = "</span><span>Adding a new subscriber</span><span>",
    </span><span>skip</span><span>(form, pool),
    </span><span>fields</span><span>(
        email = %form.email,
        name = %form.name
    )
)]
</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Where should our new validation live?</p>
<p>A first sketch could look somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/routes/subscriptions.rs
 
// An extension trait to provide the `graphemes` method 
// on`String` and `&amp;str`
</span><span>use </span><span>unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;

</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe</span><span>(
    </span><span>form</span><span>: web::Form&lt;FormData&gt;,
    </span><span>pool</span><span>: web::Data&lt;PgPool&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;HttpResponse, HttpResponse&gt; {
    </span><span>if </span><span>!</span><span>is_valid_name</span><span>(&amp;form.name) {
        </span><span>return </span><span>Err(HttpResponse::BadRequest().</span><span>finish</span><span>());
    }
    </span><span>insert_subscriber</span><span>(&amp;pool, &amp;form)
        .await
        .</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|_| HttpResponse::InternalServerError().</span><span>finish</span><span>())?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().</span><span>finish</span><span>())
}

</span><span>/// Returns `true` if the input satisfies all our validation constraints

    </span><span>!(is_empty_or_whitespace || is_too_long || contains_forbidden_characters)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>To compile the new function successfully we will have to add the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> crate to our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> add unicode-segmentation
</span></code></pre>
<p>While it <em>looks like</em> a perfectly fine solution (assuming we add a bunch of tests), functions like <code>is_valid_name</code> give us a false sense of safety.</p>

<p>Let's shift our attention to <code>insert_subscriber</code>.<br>
Let's imagine, for a second, that it requires <code>form.name</code> to be non-empty otherwise something horrible is going to happen (e.g. a panic!).</p>
<p>Can <code>insert_subscriber</code> safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty?<br>
Just by looking at its <em>type</em>, it cannot: <code>form.name</code> is a <code>String</code>. There is no guarantee about its content.<br>
If you were to look at our program in its entirety you might say: we are checking that it is non-empty at the edge, in the request handler, therefore we can safely assume that <code>form.name</code> will be non-empty every time <code>insert_subscriber</code> is invoked.</p>
<p>But we had to shift from a <em>local</em> approach (let's look at this function's parameters) to a <em>global</em> approach (let's scan the whole codebase) to make such a claim.<br>
And while it might be feasible for a small project such as ours, examining all the calling sites of a function (<code>insert_subscriber</code>) to ensure that a certain validation step has been performed beforehand quickly becomes unfeasible on larger projects.</p>
<p>If we are to stick with <code>is_valid_name</code>, the only viable approach is validating <em>again</em> <code>form.name</code> inside <code>i…</code></p></article></section></div>

You will learn all the basics about the CPU power management in this post.</p><p>The processor/CPU is designed to operate forever under a specific load. As almost none of us are doing a <code>24x7</code> calculation employing all the resources of the CPU continuously, it is most of the time not operating in its designed maximum. So what is the point of keeping the whole CPU powered on at its full capacityÂ&nbsp;? This is the point of CPU power management. The power management topic covers much more than this, including the RAM, GPU etc., but I am going to tell you only about the CPU side of the story in this post.</p><p>If you know about C-states and P-states and how CPU enters to and exits from these states, probably there is nothing new in this post for you. If not, continue reading.</p><p>I was planning to include a few real-world examples from Linux, but the post was getting longer and taking even more time to finish, so I will do that in another post.</p><p>The general information in this post is applicable to all modern CPUs but the details can be very specific to the individual CPU (esp. to the processor family) and I am using an IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1245 v5 @ 3.50GHz, this is a Xeon E3â€“1200 v5 series (formerly Skylake) processor (model number 0x5e).</p><p>The main references used in this post are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-technical-resources.html">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1200 v5 Product Family Datasheets</a></li><li><a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/88173/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-v5-8M-Cache-3_50-GHz">Intel(R) Xeon Processor E3â€“1245 v5 Product Specification</a></li><li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/white-paper/energy-efficient-platforms-2011-white-paper.pdf">Sofware Impact to Platform Energy-Efficiency (Intel White Paper)</a></li><li><a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf">Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a></li><li><a href="http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_2.pdf">ACPI Specification v6.2</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">ACPI page on Wikipedia</a></li><li>Linux Kernel Sources version 4.13.0</li></ul><p>Unless otherwise noted, all original figures and tables are from the datasheet.</p><ul><li>2019/03/01: Added CoreFreq output to last section.</li></ul><p>On its <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/52274/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1245-8M-Cache-3_30-GHz">official product page</a>, my CPU has the following features listed:</p><ul><li>Idle States</li><li>Enhanced Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology</li></ul><p>You can see on the page that “Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle.” and “Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load.”</p><p>You will learn what both of these descriptions mean throughout this post.</p><p>On a production CPU (so not considering the things that can be done while designing the CPU), to save power, you can do two things. You can:</p><ul><li>eliminate the power consumption of a subsystem (a core or other resources like clock or cache) by completely powering it down (so cutting down the voltage, reducing it to zero)</li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li>decrease the power consumption by decreasing the voltage and/or the frequency of the subsystem and/or the whole processor</li></ul><p>The first one is simple to understand, if you shut down the power, you do not consume any power.</p><p>The second requires a bit more explanation. The power consumption of an integrated circuit (such as a processor) is proportional linearly to frequency and quadratically to voltage.</p><p>P ~ f VÂ²</p><blockquote><p>Note for those of you knowing more about digital electronics:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pcpu is actually = Pdynamic + Psc + Pleak</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>On an active CPU, Pdynamic is the most important part, it is the part I mention here, being proportional to the frequency and quadratically to the voltage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Psc=Pshort-circuit is proportional to the frequency.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pleak is proportional to the voltage.</p></blockquote><p>Also, the voltage and frequency is not independent, and seems to have a linear relationship. (<a href="http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf">http://async.org.uk/tech-reports/NCL-EEE-MICRO-TR-2015-197.pdf</a>)</p><p>Higher (serial) performance requires both higher frequency and higher voltage, thus having even a larger effect on the power consumption.</p><p>This depends a lot on the processor but E3â€“1245 v5 @ 3.50 Ghz has Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 80 Watts. This is an average value the CPU can sustain forever (Power Limit/PL1 in the figure below) and it is usually the value that the cooling solutions should be designed at for reliability. Actual power CPU consumes can temporarily go higher (as shown as PL2, PL3 and PL4 in the figure below). TDP is measured under a high-complexity (~worst case) load with all cores active at the base frequency (of 3.50 Ghz).</p><figure><img data-src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png" alt="CPU Package Power Control" src="https://metebalci.com/img/blog/cpu-package-power-control-figure-5-1.png"><figcaption><p>CPU Package Power Control</p></figcaption></figure><p>You can see in the figure above that the CPU can consume more power than TDP at PL2 for up to 100 seconds, that is actually quite a long duration.</p><p>The two ways to decrease the power consumption of a processor:</p><ul><li>powering down subsystems</li><li>voltage/frequency reduction</li></ul><p>is accomplished by using:</p><ul><li>C-states</li><li>P-states</li></ul><p>respectively.</p><p>C-states describe the first case, so they are the idle (power saving) states. In order to power down a subsystem, that subsystem should not be running anything, so it should be at idle, doing nothing, executing nothing. So C-state x, Cx, means one or more subsystems of the CPU is at idle, powered down.</p><p>On the other hand, P-states describe the second case, so they are the executing (power saving) states. The subsystem is actually running but it does not require full performance so the voltage and/or frequency it operates is decreased. So P-state x, Px, means the subsystem it refers to (e.g. a CPU core) is operating at a specific (frequency, voltage) pair.</p><p>Because most modern CPUs have multiple cores in a single package, C-states are further divided into core C-states (CC-states) and package C-states (PC-states). The reason for PC-states is there are other (shared) components in the processor that can also be powered down after all cores using them are powered down (e.g. the shared cache). However, as a user or programmer, we cannot control these, since we do not interact with the package directly, but we interact with the individual cores. So we can only affect the CC-states directly, PC-states are indirectly affected based on the CC-states of the cores.</p><p>The states are numbered starting from zero like C0, C1â€¦ and P0, P1… The higher the number is the more power is saved. C0 means no power saving by shutting down something, so everything is powered on. P0 means maximum performance, thus maximum frequency, voltage and power used.</p><p>The basic C-states (defined by ACPI) are:</p><ul><li>C0: Active, CPU/Core is executing instructions. P-states are relevant here, CPU/Core may be operating at its maximum performance (thus at P0) or at a lower performance/power (thus at anything other than P0).</li><li>C1: Halt, nothing is being executed, but it can return to C0 instantenously. Since it is not working (but halted), P-states are not relevant for C1 or any Cx other than C0.</li><li>C2: Stop-Clock, similar to C1 but it takes longer time to go back to C0.</li><li>C3: Sleep. It can go back to C0, but it will take considerably longer time.</li></ul><p>Many modern CPUs have plenty more C-states and according to its datasheet IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E3-1200 v5 Family has C0, C1, C1E (C1 Enhanced), C2, C3, C6, C7 and C8. C1 and C1E are CC-states only, and C2 is only a PC-state. All others are both a CC-state and a PC-state.</p><blockquote><p>Note: There are also thread level C-states because of Intel Hyper-Threading. However, the individual threads can only request C-states but power saving action only takes place when the core enters to that C-state.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Discuss some differences between macOS and common Unix systems to help Unix users get familiar with macOS sooner.</p><div>
				
<h2 id="users-and-groups">Users and Groups</h2>

<p>macOS manages users and groups by directory services instead of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and  <code>/etc/group</code>.  Consider a local network, for example, the one in your office, there’re many computers in the network and each has its own files, accounts, etc. A directory service organizes these distributed resources into one single index and makes them look like a directory hierarchy.</p>

<p>For example, <code>/Hosts/PC1</code> represents a host in the network and <code>/Users/Smith</code> represents a user in the network.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>macOS uses the <code>dscl</code> command to interact with directory services.</p>

<p>To list all users on the system, we could run the following.</p>



<p>The first argument sets which datasource we want to retrieve from. A dot means the local datasource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># List groups
dscl . -list /Groups
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>-list</code> option lets <code>dscl</code> print subitems of a resource.  Subitems of <code>/Users</code> are all users. Subitems of <code>/Groups</code> are all groups.</p>

<p>If we want to check the information about the resource instead of listing subitems we should use <code>-read</code>. For example, we could check the information of the user <code>Smith</code> like
the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Retrieve the information of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>-read</code> prints keys and values of the specified resource. We could also specify the keys we want.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Get the primary group ID and default shell of Smith
dscl . -read /Users/Smith PrimaryGroupID UserShell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To add a resource, we use <code>dscl . -create</code>. The following command adds a new user <code>belson</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems ok but it’s actually not. If we try to set a password for <code>belson</code> using <code>sudo passwd belson</code>, <code>passwd</code> will tell us the user doesn’t exist. Because <code>dscl</code> just adds a record to the data source but is doesn’t check the integrity. It doesn’t even assign a UID for <code>belson</code>. We must assign a UID and a primary group for <code>belson</code> after adding it to the datasource by ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>belson</code> is a Unix user and you can set a password for him using <code>passwd</code>. However, you still can’t login as <code>belson</code> for we don’t assign him a shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well we can login as <code>belson</code> now but he doesn’t have a home directory. We must create the directory and specify it with <code>dscl</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sounds hell right? But it’s not over. Run <code>dscl . -read /Groups/staff</code> and you will find that
neither the <code>GroupMembers</code> nor the <code>GroupMembership</code> attribute has any information about <code>belson</code>.  We have specified his primary group to <code>staff</code>. But as mentioned above, <code>dscl</code> doesn’t check the integrity. Bidirectional relationships must be maintained manually. This is the real hell.</p>

<p>To solve the user-group relationship problem, we could use <code>dseditgroup</code>. The following command adds <code>belson</code> to the <code>staff</code> group and it takes care of the integrity.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should make a summary here. To create a user <code>belson</code> in the group <code>staff</code>, we need:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UniqueID 511	# UID 511 for example
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson PrimaryGroupID 20	# The staff group
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson UserShell /bin/bash
sudo dscl . -create /Users/belson NFSHomeDirectory /Users/belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
sudo mkdir /User/belson
sudo chmod -R belson:staff /User/belson
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is painful for a system administrator to type so many commands just to create a new user. You must miss <code>adduser</code> and <code>addgroup</code> in Debian so much.</p>

<p>Luckily, since Mac OS X 10.10, the <code>sysadminctl</code> command is provided. It’s a high-level interface of <code>dscl</code>. Type <code>sysadminctl</code> in the terminal to see its usage<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Usage: sysadminctl
	-deleteUser &lt;user name&gt; [-secure || -keepHome] (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-newPassword &lt;new password&gt; -oldPassword &lt;old password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;]
	-resetPasswordFor &lt;local user name&gt; -newPassword &lt;new password&gt; [-passwordHint &lt;password hint&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-addUser &lt;user name&gt; [-fullName &lt;full name&gt;] [-UID &lt;user ID&gt;] [-shell &lt;path to shell&gt;] [-password &lt;user password&gt;] [-hint &lt;user hint&gt;] [-home &lt;full path to home&gt;] [-admin] [-picture &lt;full path to user image&gt;] (interactive] || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenStatus &lt;user name&gt;
	-secureTokenOn &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-secureTokenOff &lt;user name&gt; -password &lt;password&gt; (interactive || -adminUser &lt;administrator user name&gt; -adminPassword &lt;administrator password&gt;)
	-guestAccount &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-afpGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-smbGuestAccess &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-automaticTime &lt;on || off || status&gt;
	-filesystem status
	-screenLock &lt;immediate || off&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;

Pass '-' instead of password in commands above to request prompt.
'-adminPassword' used mostly for scripted operation. Use '-' or 'interactive' to get the authentication string interactivly. This preferred for security reasons
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code>sysadminctl</code> to delete <code>belson</code> first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -deleteUser belson -secure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code>dscl</code> to check the directory service, we could find that everything we did is removed.</p>

<p>Now, we add <code>belson</code> again with <code>sysadminctl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo sysadminctl -addUser belson
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a belson -t user staff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two commands finish the job.</p>

<h2 id="filesystem-hierarchy">Filesystem Hierarchy</h2>

<p>If you check the root directory, you will see some traditional Unix things like <code>/usr</code>, <code>/var</code>, and <code>/etc</code>. You may also find mac-specified things like <code>/Library</code> <code>/Applications</code>, and <code>/cores</code>.</p>

<p>A list of mac-specified directories with their purposes in the root directory is here<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/private</td>
      <td>Contains the tmp, var, etc, directories. <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/etc</code> are symbolic links to these subdirectories</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>Contains support files for locally installed applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/System</td>
      <td>Contains a subdirectory, Library, that holds support files for the system and system applications, among other things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Network</td>
      <td>Contains network-mounted Application, Library, and Users directories, as well as a Servers directory that contains directories mounted by the auto mount daemon.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>Contains home directories for the users on the system. The root user’s home directory is /var/root (actually /private/var/root).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>Contains all visible mounted filesystems, including removable media and mounted disk images.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We could make a list to compare some of them with Linux.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>macOS</th>
      <th>Linux</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/System/Library</td>
      <td>/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Library</td>
      <td>/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Users</td>
      <td>/home</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/Volumes</td>
      <td>/mnt, /media</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You may be confused here for the difference between <code>/Library</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. Which directory should we put libraries into?</p>

<p><code>/Library</code> is for macOS-specified softwares, like the data of things you download from the App Store, and BSD programs shipped with macOS, like modules of pre-installed Perl and of pre-installed Python.</p>

<p><code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code> are for Unix programs installed by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="booting">Booting</h2>

<p>In modern Linux, the first program launched by the kernel is <code>systemd</code>. In macOS it’s <code>launchd</code><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p><code>launchd</code> manages two types of services, <code>LaunchDaemon</code> and <code>LaunchAgent</code>. <code>LaunchDaemon</code> will be launched after the system is booted. <code>LaunchAgent</code> will be launched after a user is logged-in.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after the system is booted, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code> or <code>/System/LaunchDaemons</code>.</p>

<p>If a program needs to be launched after a user logged-in, a <code>.plist</code> file is required to be placed into <code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code> or <code>/System/LaunchAgents</code>, or <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code> of the user.</p>

<p>The <code>launchctl</code> command is used to control services of <code>launchd</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># to enable sshd
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

# to disable sshd
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>You bought a Mac for development. People told you that you need to do the following two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Install Xcode from the app store</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install command line tools using <code>xcode-select --install</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You finished them, opened the terminal and found everything is familiar. You decided to write a classic Hello World with C to celebrate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	printf("%s\n", "hello, world");
	return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re using a 3rd party compiler, the compiler may tell you that <code>stdio.h</code> can’t be found.</p>

<p>No such fundamental file? You want to check <code>/usr/include</code> and you will find that even <code>/usr/include</code> doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>The reason is that header files are put into the package of Xcode in newer Xcode like Xcode 10. You can run <code>xcrun --show-sdk-path</code> to print the path<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ xcrun --show-sdk-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can use <code>-isysroot</code> to specify the path for the compiler, for example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gcc -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk hello.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h2>

<p>The first package installed to the system is usually a package manager. However, macOS has no default package manager. If you search online, you will find that <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the most popular package manager for macOS.</p>

<p>Homebrew is good for many people but not for one who wants things to go more like common Unix systems.</p>

<p>Homebrew can’t run as root. If you want to install python, you run <code>brew install python</code> instead of <code>sudo brew install python</code>. Homebrew installs packages to <code>/usr/local</code>. To achieve its goal about sudo-free, Homebrew changes the owner of all files and subdirectories under <code>/usr/local</code> to the user who installed Homebrew.</p>

<p>This brings security issues. Considering a malware …</p></div></div>

		<h2 id="board-view-is-here">Board View is here</h2>

<p>For Todoist users, the Board View was introduced in this new update, a more visual way to organize your Planner projects. This new layout makes it easy to see the big picture of your projects and make progress from start to finish.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board"></p>

<p>To see your projects in the <b>Board View</b>, press the three dots icon in the top right, and select <b>View as board</b>. You’ll be able to rearrange your sections, create new ones, and drag your tasks to anywhere on your board.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/board-settings.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<h2 id="sub-project">Sub-project</h2>
<p>One of the most requested features comes to Planner 2.6, keep your ever-growing project list neat and organized with sub-projects.</p>

<p>You can collapse sub-projects under their “parent” projects to temporarily hide them from view. This helps to focus on the right projects at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-turn-a-project-into-a-sub-project">How to turn a project into a sub-project</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Right click on a project.</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Move</b> option.</li>
  <li>Select a project.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<h3 id="quick-search">Quick Search</h3>

<p>A big update for the Quick Find feature is here, with new views and feactures.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/Quick%20Search.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Search now saves your last searches, so you can hop around without even typing.</li>
  <li>Added new <b>Tomorrow</b> view.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to search between <b>Sections</b></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="task-defaults">Task defaults</h3>

<p>Added a new view in <b>Preferences</b> to edit task defaults.</p>

<p><img src="https://useplanner.com/images/blogs/2020-12-24-merry-christmas-everyone-planner-2-6-is-here/tasks-defaults.png" alt="Planner 2.6 Planner Board 2"></p>

<ul>
  <li>New tasks on top: Indicate the position where the new tasks were created.</li>
  <li>Underline completed tasks.</li>
  <li>Default priority: Select the default priority when creating a task.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="add-tasks-projects-sections-asynchronously">Add tasks, projects, sections asynchronously</h3>

<p>Adding a task, project or section is a quick process but sometimes this process stops or does not respond mainly to problems with the internet connection. Planner 2.6 creates the tasks asynchronously with the possibility of being able to cancel the process at any time.</p>

		<p><strong>About Outer Orbit</strong><br>
		<em>Outer Orbit</em> is an attempt to create a “Spacewar!-for-one” as a tribute to the line of heritage of digital video games. It combines elements of the most classic shooter games, <em>Spacewar!</em> (1961/62) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/">[1]</a>, the first known video game on a digital computer, <em>Computer Space</em> (1971) <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/rc2017/04/02.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a>, the first coin-operated digital video game, and <em>Asteroids</em> (1979) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/" target="_blank">Spacewar!</a>”</em> it borrows the comic book spaceship, the central star, gravity and orbital mechanics,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://www.masswerk.at/icss/" target="_blank">Computer Space</a>”</em> the game mechanics of the saucer opponents and the time-based gameplay,</li>
			<li>from <em>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asteroids</a>”,</em> well, the asteroids, which serve here just as additional obstacles to make the game a bit trickier.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> A wave has a fixed duration of 80 seconds. You may progress to the next wave/level, if you manage to outscore the saucers in a given level, i.e. shoot the saucers more often than your ship crashes, by this maintaining a positive balance. Mind that the balance is reset to zero at the start of each level.</p>
		<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Like in <em>Spacewar!</em> enter an orbit around the gravitational star by aligning your spaceship perpendicular to its center and firing your thruster for two or three seconds. — Do not attempt to destroy asteroids, dodge them.</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong> The sound-scape is for the most a homage to <em>Computer Space,</em> less the background hum. The display font is based on definitions for a PDP-1 font renderer (early 1960s) and implemented in software. In order to bring the iterative machanics of a gravity based game to the modern age of asynchronous rendering, the game is computed internally in fixed time slices of an 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a second and the display rendered on demand.</p>
		<p><strong>Setting an Initial Level:</strong> Experienced players may want to select the initial level by specifying a wave as an URL-parameter, as in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30">https://www.masswerk.at/outerorbit/?wave=30</a> for a game starting at wave #30.</p>

      <p><a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>
      
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy,
      not performance, usability, or anything else. </p><p>
      
      All commands listed in this guide will require root privileges. Words beginning with "$" sign indicate a variable that may differ between users as to suit their
      setup.
    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This protects against <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337">time-wait assassination</a>…</p></div>

            <p>
                Posted on <time datetime="2020-12-24 09:53:00">December 24, 2020</time>
            </p>
                        <p>According to conventional wisdom, if you earn 31€/hour, and a task costs less than that to outsource, then you should always pay someone else to do it. For example, if your cleaning person charges 15€/hour, you save 16€ for every hour you spend at work instead of cleaning your house.</p>
<p>I've encountered this advice quite often, particularly among the wealthier, productivity porn-loving, <em>4-Hour Work Week</em>-thumping entrepreneur crowd.<br></p>
<p>I don't think that advice is quite right.</p>
<h2>Your time is worth less than you think</h2>
<p>There is a hefty tax on converting time to money. In Germany, if you earned the average income (42 421€ per year)<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a></sup>, you'd lose roughly a quarter of it to income tax<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=einkommensteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup>. Your 31€/hour salary<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a>, <a href="https://clockify.me/working-hours">2</a></sup> is actually worth 24€/hour after taxes.</p>
<p>But there is more to account for: health insurance (7.3%), unemployment insurance (1.25%), public pension (9.3%) and nursing care insurance (1.775%)<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=lohnsteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup> are also deducted from your salary. When it's all said and done, you take home about 20€/hour. If you also pay church tax and get the most expensive health insurance, you keep 19€/hour.</p>
<p>So again, if you earn the average 31€/hour, and work the average 1386 hours per year, you save about 4€ per hour - not 16€ - by hiring a cleaning person who charges half your rate.</p>
<p>Taxes aren't the only thing that whittle away your disposable income. You also have some unavoidable expenses, namely rent, groceries and utilities. That's 550€, 150€ and 100€ per month for a single, thrifty Berliner. That's 35% of your take-home salary, so you're left with 12.50€/hour in disposable income. At this point, I'm including decimals, because they start to matter.</p>
<p>In other words, you must sell 72 minutes of your life to buy 60 minutes of your cleaning person's life, even though you earn twice as much.</p>
<p>Here's a recap for the mathematically inclined:</p>
<pre>hourly_disposable income = (
    (gross_income - income_tax)
    - health_insurance
    - unemployment_insurance
    - pension_insurance
    - nursing_care_insurance
    - (rent + groceries + utilities) * 12
) / hours_worked_per_year</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this describes the reality in Germany, where people work much less, but pay higher taxes. You will get wildly different results in your own country.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing costs more than you think</h2>
<p>Eating out is often used as an example of trading money for time. It's faster than cooking your own food: no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.<br></p>
<p>In Berlin, you can get a square meal for 10€. A croissant, a coffee and two square meals would set you back 20€ a day. By comparison, my grocery bill is 5€ a day. That's a 450€/month difference, or 37.5 hours of your time (see above), but you'd probably spend that much time between the supermarket and the kitchen anyway.<br></p>
<p>However, getting to&nbsp;the restaurant, ordering, waiting for your food, then waiting for the bill takes time too. Personally, I&nbsp;find cooking every other day more convenient  than eating out twice a day. Eating out only makes sense when I'm too tired to cook.<br></p>
<p>This also applies to hiring professionals. You still need time to find one and to work with their schedule. I can change the oil or the brakes on my motorcycle in about 30 minutes. It takes me about as long to drop my bike off at the dealership, but I&nbsp;have to do it during office hours, and wait a few days to get it back.<br></p>
<p>In short, outsourcing your work does not always make life easier. It can lighten your mental load, but so does working less by having lower expenses.<br> </p>
<h2>Time is not a liquid asset</h2>
<p>In practice, you don't get to choose how much of your time you sell.&nbsp;If your expenses are covered, you just can't stop going to work. If you need more money, you could work more, but rarely on your own terms, just when you need to. You couldn't sell an extra 2 hours of programming on a Thursday night, because you have nothing else going on.&nbsp; There's also a limit on how much time you can sustainably sell, regardless of demand - about 60 hours a week.<br></p>
<p>You can't choose which time you sell either. Most employers will only buy your office hours. You can't decide to work night shifts, or to work 80 hour weeks in the winter, then take the summer off. You can't even decide where to allocate the time you <em>didn't</em> sell. Your employer usually decides when you take your lunch breaks, and when you can use your holidays. If you're on call, even your free time isn't quite yours.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't really trade more time at the office for less time cleaning your house. You're stuck at the office for 40 hours a week regardless, so you're just using some of your fixed budget. However, if you <em>don't</em> hire a cleaning person, and you don't spend your money, then you can buy some&nbsp;of your time back later, either as a gap year, or as an early retirement.</p>
<p>As a freelancer, you have much more control over what time you sell, and in which amount. Nonetheless, you are still bound to standard contract lengths, to the limits of your body, and to cyclical demand in your industry. A freelance accountant likely won't take time off during tax season. A freelance developer will mostly find 3 to 6 month contracts.<br></p>
<p>Put shortly, time is not a liquid asset. You can't easily  sell more or less of it according to your needs.</p>
<h2>Time does not have a fixed value</h2>
<p>Let's pretend that your boss lets you work for as long as you need, whenever you need to. You could spend an extra hour at the office, and pay someone to save you an hour of cleaning.</p>
<p>I'd make that deal. Swearing at my computer brings me joy, but doing the dishes doesn't. I'd gladly trade a few hours of programming for a few hours of cleaning.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/good-time.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>My definition of a good time</figcaption></figure>
<p>After 30 hours a week, I'd start to value my time at the office a bit more. I'd rather spend that time at home, sipping a beer on my balcony with a pie in the oven, so I&nbsp;wouldn't be so keen to sell it.</p>
<p>After 50 hours, I'd be selling my time at a much higher price. There's a point where work takes a toll on your body, and seeps into other aspects of your life.&nbsp;By then, menial work feels like a release, rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Unless you&nbsp;<em>really</em> like your job, there comes a point where you'd rather do something else, even if has a lower market value than your profession.<br></p>
<h2>The hidden benefits of doing it yourself</h2>
<p>The most understated benefit of doing things yourself is the skills and the tools you acquire along the way. Your cooking gets better and more diversified with every meal you cook. Bike repairs get cheaper and easier with every attempt. Those skills stay with you, and over time, the benefits compound. You can tackle bigger and bigger projects, and the results look better and better.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/level-up.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Outsourcing, on the other hand, doesn't get better and cheaper. It either gets better and more expensive, or cheaper and worse. This ties your quality of life to a single variable: your income. Your lifestyle is much more reliant on your ability to stay employed, because it's the only thing you can do.<br></p>
<p>Beyond that, doing things yourself is immensely rewarding. Wrenching on your own motorcycle feels good. Delighting your guests with a home-cooked meal feels good. Using shelves you built yourself feels good. These are direct products of your hard work, and symbols of the control you have over your environment.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that it gives you a greater appreciation for the world you live in. It allows you to see things beyond the surface. Musicians appreciate music on a different level,
 and the same can be said for gardeners, machinists, architects and 
every other kind of enthusiast. My fledgling interest in gardening quite literally made me see the forest for the trees.<br></p>
<p>Paying someone else to do it robs you of this joy. Climbing through the career ladder provides its own rewards, but those always felt too abstract to me. If I  indirectly make my company a little leaner, I&nbsp;get 4% more disposable income. Big whoop.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Some tasks don't develop useful skills. They don't get easier, cheaper or more enjoyable with time. Chores are chores, and some work is just plain tedious. No matter how good I&nbsp;get at painting walls, I still hate it with a passion.&nbsp;My father fixed cars his entire life, and he won't change his oil in the winter, when the car is caked in&nbsp;slush.</p>
<p>Life is short, and the 40 hour work week isn't going anywhere, so it's okay to spare your free time for things you enjoy. That's worth paying a premium for.</p>
<p>Even if you enjoy doing something, the timing isn't always right.&nbsp;I found that my motorcycle's front rim was bent just before leaving for a 3 month trip. I already had a lot on my plate with work and trip preparations, so I paid a mechanic to do it. Outsourcing lets you solve multiple problems in parallel.</p>
<p>In some cases, the upfront cost of doing things yourself is just too high. I won't resurface my motorcycle's cylinder head at home, because the tools cost more than my net worth, and highly trained machinists will do it for 100€.&nbsp;Sometimes, it's better to let economies of scale do their thing.</p>
<p>In other cases, the running costs are too high. All those things you maintain will chip away at your free time. In aggregate, they can swallow your evenings. For example, think twice about running your own server to save a few euros per month. These needy buggers tend to require your attention at the most inopportune times. Outsourcing means someone else is taking care of it, and invoicing you once a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the risk isn't worth the potential savings. It's important to learn how to do things yourself, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't cause hundreds of euros worth of damage to save a few euros. Hire a professional, and let them do their job.&nbsp;If they cock up, <em>they</em> are liable to fix the mess, not you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, outsourcing has its time and place, but it's more expensive than it appears. Sometimes, it's better to do things yourself, and acquire useful skills …</p></article></div></div></div>

  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created these "In progress"
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/notification-types/">notifications</a>
    in Teamplify:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="No issues in progress" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.png?3488 2x" width="494" height="106">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.
  </p>

  
  
  <h2 id="make-work-progress-visible">
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Make work progress visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="Team Calendar" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar@2x.png?3488 2x" width="704" height="458">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="make-time-off-visible">
    <a href="#make-time-off-visible">Make time-off visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="Sick day notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day@2x.png?3488 2x" width="552" height="344">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="Time off friendly reminder" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.png?3488 2x" width="537" height="212">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="identify-stuck-progress">
    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="No recent commits notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits@2x.png?3488 2x" width="534" height="74">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.webp?3488 1x, https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.webp?3488 2x" type="image/webp">
      <img alt="Pending questions notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.png?3488" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.png?3488 2x" width="666" height="154">
    </picture>
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s Christmastime again! Shall we talk about trees? This post is about my new
holiday hobby: hallucinating tree-shaped fractals using our old friend,
gradient descent.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/tree-building.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<hr>
<p>But — let me start at the beginning. For a variety of reasons, the cover
image of Douglas Hofstadter’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop"><em>I am a Strange
Loop</em></a> has been on my mind
this month. I have been thinking a lot about this wonderful image created by
pointing a camera at a projector that displays what the camera is seeing. In
modern terms: what happens if you screen-share the screen sharing window? This
happens:</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/strange-loop.png" alt="from the cover of the book"></p>
<p>Such “feedback loop” recursions often rapidly converge to breathtaking
fixed-points. The NYC MoMath even has an <a href="https://momath.org/25-feedback-fractals-1/">art
installation</a> that lets you play
with a camera-and-projector setup to make <a href="https://twitter.com/momath1/status/824740594564075520">wonderful
patterns</a>.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there is a mathematical theory here. At risk of ruining the
mystery, I will tell you about it, though without writing any equations. :-)
The theory is the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system">Iterated Function
Systems</a>, which is
almost exactly what it sounds like. Start with a set of affine functions
(affine because that’s what camera-projector-systems do) and repeatedly apply
them to a set of points, taking the union at each step. Regardless of where you
start, you will soon end up with a fractal structure which is the fixed point
of the system. Why fractal? —because the self-similarity comes from the
infinitely-nested composition of the affine functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Ifs-construction.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>There are theorems that ensure convergence towards and uniqueness of this fixed
point in the limit, but… it’s believable enough, don’t you think? Following
your intuition, you can build Sierpinski Triangles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern">Barnsley
Ferns</a> and all sorts of other
beautiful structures using an IFS. I refer you to Section 8.2 of <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop"><em>The
Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</em> by Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer (yes, <em>that</em>
Lindenmayer)</a> for more botanical
connections.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Fractal_fern_explained.png" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now here is the question that has been on my mind: if I give you a picture of a
fractal-fern, can you give me a set of affine functions whose fixed point is
that fern? This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system#The_inverse_problem"><em>inverse
problem</em></a>
for IFSes. According to Wikipedia, this problem has real-world applications in
image compression, but it is <em>hard</em> to do in general.</p>
<p>Hmm. Interesting. Can our favorite tool, gradient descent, come to the rescue?
At least in an approximate sense? Recall that a two-dimensional affine function
is really just a 3x3 matrix (with 6 free parameters) that encodes the details
of the transformation. If we could easily compute images of IFS fixed points
from a set of matrices, then perhaps we could try to optimize the parameters of
these matrices to make the fixed point look the way we want it to.</p>
<p>The challenge, of course, is efficiently <em>finding</em> the fixed point —
repeatedly rasterizing and compositing affine transformations on images sounds
expensive — and doing so differentiably sounds like a scalability nightmare!
But there is a wonderful solution to this problem, which is to play the
so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">chaos game</a>.” Instead of
<em>densely</em> applying all the functions to all the points on the plane, you can
<em>sparsely</em> approximate the fixed point as follows: Start with a point — any
point! — and <em>randomly</em> select one of the affine functions of the IFS and
apply it to the point. Repeat this process with the new point. It turns out
that in the limit, the “trail” left behind by this wandering point converges to
the fixed point of the IFS. (This, too, is a theorem, but again I think it is
believable enough that I will not demand a proof.) This is what the “chaos
game” looks like for the Sierpinski triangle; notice how the salt-and-pepper
spattering of points soon converges boldly into the fractal we know and love
(it’s an animation — stare for a few seconds).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/Sierpinski_chaos_animated.gif" alt="from Wikipedia"></p>
<p>So here is the plan: we start with a point, and play the chaos game with our
current IFS matrices to obtain a <em>point cloud</em> that stochastically approximates
the fixed-point. Then, we compare this <em>point cloud</em> to our target fern-image
to obtain a “loss.” Finally, we update our IFS matrix parameters to minimize
this loss, until at last the fixed-point converges to the target image. It’s
just “machine learning,” really: we’re learning to play the chaos game!</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the algorithm (with some details elided):</p>
<pre><code># initialize IFS
F = [random_3x3_affine() for _ in range(4)]
o = torch.optim.Adam(F, lr=0.0001)

for step in range(100_000):
    o.zero_grad()
    # start at origin
    v = torch.tensor([0., 0., 1.])

    # play the chaos game once
    trace = []
    for _ in range(200):
          # applying an affine function is just
        # a matrix multiplication!
        v = torch.matmul(random.choice(F), v)
        trace.append(v)

    # treat the trace as a point cloud
    loss = compare(target_image, trace)

    # update parameters
    loss.backward()
    o.step()
</code></pre>
<p>Ah! Actually, there is <em>one</em> detail that I <em>should</em> explain: how do you compare
a point cloud and an image? My idea is to convert the target image to a
<em>second</em> point cloud by uniformly sampling points from it, for example by
rejection-sampling. Then you can compare the two point clouds by the so-called
“chamfer distance,” which is the mean distance from each point to its nearest
neighbor in the opposite point cloud. This is quadratic-time to compute, and
the most expensive part of the whole operation, but with ~100 points in each
set it is quite doable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pedagogical aside: notice that the “trick” here is really a <em>change in
representation.</em> This optimization problem is easier to solve on point clouds
than on raster images! An important lesson, that applies across the
ML-for-graphics domain… and more broadly to all differentiable programming
enterprises.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Remarkably, this zany scheme works quite well! Let’s try it with a heart. (A
heart, because it’s an easy low-entropy shape, but also because it felt
symbolically appropriate in relation to Hofstadter’s broader philosophical
project of souls-within-souls-within-souls.)</p>
<p>When we initialize the system with 4 random affine transformations, the trail
left behind by the chaos game is very unimpressive. The sparsity is because I
simulate only 200 steps of the chaos game for each step of gradient descent —
there’s a tradeoff between noise and computation time, of course, as there is
with any form of SGD.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples-early.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Okay. Time to optimize! Here is what it looks like after 100K steps of
optimization with an Adam optimizer (that’s about 40 minutes of wall-time
computation on my old MacBook). It looks pretty good, don’t you think? The
chamfer distance scheme works!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-samples.png" alt="chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Now we can export the four affine matrices out from PyTorch and work out the
“true” fixed point with a more expensive offline computation (for example, by
simulating a few <em>million</em> steps of the chaos game). It looks like this — not
perfect, and indeed quite crayon-scribble-ey, but clearly <em>something</em>
interesting has happened, and the result is convincingly heartlike.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart-fractal.png" alt="extended chaos game on a heart"></p>
<p>Where is the fractal structure hidden in this heart? This needs some
vizualization tooling to see clearly. After a bit of JS-canvas-hacking: here is
a GIF of the heart that reveals its fixed-point structure.
Hearts-in-hearts-in-hearts!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/heart.gif" alt="Heart"></p>
<p>I will admit to blinking a few times when I first saw this animation play out
in full — I did <em>not</em> expect it to work, and even now I find myself marveling
at this creation? discovery? of a heart encoded in 24 numbers.</p>
<hr>
<p>But it still doesn’t look <em>quite right</em> — the fractalness isn’t <em>obvious</em>.
How come? It’s because our affine transformations stretch and squash the heart
into almost unrecognizable blobs. A final, natural improvement is to force our
affine transformations to be <em>rigid</em>, so that there isn’t any squishing or
skewing in the fractal. This is actually not too bad to implement: the solution
to problems of constraint are typically reparametrizations, and indeed in this
case we can simply reparametrize the matrices in terms of a rotation, an
(isotropic) scale, and a translation. Now we’re down from 6 parameters per
matrix to just 4 — even more magical! The result is a much more “obviously”
fractal-ey fixed point, simply because your eye can more easily pick out the
structural recursion when it is made of rigid motions.</p>
<p>Let’s take it for a — pardon — <em>spin!</em></p>
<p>Since I promised you trees, here is some fractal foliage. The target image was
a picture of a maple leaf! I’d never thought about this before, but indeed a
maple leaf contains within it an echo of the whole tree. (Full disclosure: it
takes a couple of randomized restarts to get a really impressive result — the
low dimensionality of the fractal’s parametrization leads to the same
stuck-in-a-local-optimum woes that differentiable rendering folks face all the
time…)</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/foliage.gif" alt="Leaf"></p>
<p>This one uses just three matrices — experimentally, three matrices tend to be
enough to get really good results, and more just lead to very busy and crowded
fractals. (I don’t know if there is a word for number-of-maps–in-an-IFS, but
let’s call it the IFS’s <em>arity</em>. In this terminology, I like <em>ternary</em> IFSes.)</p>
<p>And finally, since I promised you Christmas trees…</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree.gif" alt="Christmas tree"></p>
<p>This last animation is actually absolutely <em>baffling</em> to me. In part, this is
because of how <em>treelike</em> the fractal turned out — here it is overlayed
against the silhouette I optimized against. Can you imagine this is encoded by
just 12 parameters? Odd.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/chaos-game/christmas-tree-match.png" alt="Tree vs. silhouette"></p>
<p>But even more bafflingly: the actual geometry of the recursion is <em>nothing</em>
like the tree recursion geometry you and I are used to from CS106! Compare the
GIF above to Barnsley’s Fern: while Barnsley turns each full leaf into two
smaller leaves with “semantic” affine maps, this Christmas tree does all sorts
of <em>bizarre</em> uninterpretable cartwheels and somehow almost magically works
itself out in the end. It is mesmerizing to me, …</p></section></article></div>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs.

<blockquote>
<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>
