<p><strong>KLM is in the throes of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at the start of 2020, numerous measures have already been taken to deal with the current circumstances. Expectations are that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with uncertainty. This means that KLM’s structure and size must be rigorously adjusted even further in the years ahead. Consequently, a total of 4,500 to 5,000 positions in the entire KLM Group (expressed in FTEs) will cease to exist.</strong></p>



<p>In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, KLM gradually began reducing the size of its network in February to operate less than 10% of its original number of <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">flights</a> by the start of April. In the second quarter, only 15% of the original number of flights were operated. In July, 30% of the original flights were operated and load factors are lagging behind. As a result, while the network is again being gradually and carefully expanded, revenues are lagging far behind.</p>

 <!-- end A --> 





<p>Prospects for the airline industry – and KLM in particular – are uncertain. Different countries are now beginning to tighten their more relaxed travel restrictions. This is making customers more cautious when it comes to booking a ticket. In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. The degree and speed of recovery will depend on a number of factors including the development of the virus, economic recovery and customer travel behaviour.</p>



<h2>KLM Adjusting to the New Reality</h2>



<p>Government support in the form of a direct state loan and guaranteed bank credit facilities amounting to a maximum of €3.4 billion will enable KLM to navigate the crisis in the forthcoming period. <a href="https://news.klm.com/klm-adapts-organisation-further-due-to-covid-19-crisis/" target="_blank" aria-label="KLM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KLM</a> is extremely grateful for this support provided by means of the loan. In order to guarantee KLM’s existence in the longer term, the airline must adapt its size to the new reality. KLM therefore finds itself compelled to reduce its workforce down to the number needed for the planned operation in 2021/2022. Of the current total of 33,000 FTEs in the entire KLM Group, the workforce must be reduced by 4,500 to 5,000 FTEs to 28,000 FTEs in the course of 2021.</p>



<p>KLM’s size is already becoming smaller – and will continue to be reduced – based on the current measures, which include the non-renewal of temporary contracts (1,500 FTEs) and the Voluntarily Departure Scheme (2,000 FTEs). Additionally, natural attrition (500 FTEs) through retirement and the like in 2020 and 2021 will also contribute to the reduction needed.</p>



<p>Hence, despite the measures already taken, even fewer people will be needed at KLM in the years ahead. Additionally, for positions on the ground we also need to deal with some mismatch in functional skills and capabilities.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for this reason and taking into account the mismatch, alternative solutions will have to be found for ca. 1,500 positions. This relates to up to 500 ground positions, 300 cabin crew positions and 300 cockpit positions and approximately 400 positions at KLM subsidiaries and Air France-KLM group functions.</p>



<p>Given the high level of uncertainty, KLM keeps open the possibility of further reductions in case the production levels will be revised further down for 2021/2022 than the -20% planned now.</p>

<h3>KLM to Cooperate with Trade unions and Works Council</h3>



<p>KLM’s reorganisation plans tie in with organisation-wide changes at Air France KLM. In the forthcoming period, KLM will be cooperating closely with the trade unions to draft a social plan for each collective labour agreement domain and subsidiary, as well as maintaining close consultation with the Works Council about further defining the reorganisation. This will include a more detailed specification of the conditions set by the Dutch government on issuing the financing package. Expectations are that this will be finished in its entirety in the course of October.“</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A great deal has already been done in recent months with respect to adjusting the size of our company in the face of a new reality. Unfortunately, more measures are needed in the short term to guarantee KLM’s continued existence in the future. For this reason, we are elaborating the reorganisation plan to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, while retaining as many jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying the loans as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em>KLM employees are loyal, professional and hard working. They are always ready to serve our customers, one another, the company and society at large. Recent developments have again served to prove that this is true. It is incredibly difficult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valuable, committed colleagues. Certainly in view of how much we have succeeded in achieving together in recent years. The forthcoming period will be devoted to saying goodbye to colleagues who have to leave with due care and to reconstructing KLM.</em></p></blockquote>

						<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p><em><strong>Architectural unrest about Autodesk and its support for the industry’s design businesses is growing. Discontent has been simmering for a decade or more, and has led to calls for EU action.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2013/11/autodesk.logo2013.jpg" alt="autodesk logo" width="181" height="31"></a>The recent <a href="https://letters-to-autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to Autodesk</a> from 17 named members of a 25-strong group of leading architects (28 July 2020: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/"><em>Design firms demand change at Autodesk</em></a>) has been supported by more firms. They extend the geographical reach of those prepared to publicly criticise the US AEC software vendor over its support for architectural design businesses – many of them heavily reliant upon Autodesk’s Revit design software. An additional 18 practices now stand alongside the original letter’s signatories, bringing the total to 35. A further 10 practices are supportive, but have not gone public. In total, more than 50 firms have therefore backed the group’s grievances.</p>

<p>It is clear that Iain Godwin has tapped into a growing sense of unease, though, to be fair, rumblings of discontent have been heard many times over the past decade or so from a variety of software commentators and end-users. For example:</p>

</ul>
<p>Concerns about some software vendors’ monopolistic positions have also been raised internationally by industry organisations, including the <a href="http://www.fiec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC</a>).</p>
<h3>FIEC position paper</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fiec.eu/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg" alt="FIEC logo" width="300" height="117" srcset="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg 300w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-160x62.jpg 160w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo.jpg 443w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>On 24 February 2020, the FIEC published a position paper on the relationship between users and software companies/ editors/ service providers (<em><a href="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/2020-02-24-FIEC_position_on_software_companies-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a></em>). No vendors are named, but, from the similarity of the claims, Autodesk is clearly one of the software providers that FIEC is sufficiently concerned about to urge the European Commission to review competition and data management regulations. Its paper discusses challenges and makes recommendations under four headings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The dominant position of a few software companies/editors/providers raises major concerns.</strong> – The FIEC urges the European Commission to target competition issues relating to software user contracts</li>
<li><strong>The non-EU origin of these suppliers and their infrastructure is exacerbating the lack of autonomy in software capability in the EU.</strong> – The FIEC says EU software users should be allowed to decide where their data is stored (“EU companies should be able to have their data hosted on EU territory, by EU servers/companies, under EU legislation”), calls for the creation of a secure European Cloud, and says software services “should be required to meet EU standards for interoperability and open access”.</li>
<li><strong>Contracting authorities must remain software-neutral and promote open standards</strong>. – The FIEC calls for enforcement of EU public procurement rules, and urges promotion of open standards for data, protocols and file formats in public procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Rules need to be established for multiple-user-access platforms such as BIM models.</strong> – Similarly, the FIEC urges EU measures aimed at protecting the data owner while ensuring appropriate data access rights for other users.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Autodesk not alone in hosting, US dominance, interoperability issues</h3>
<p>Some of these issues are already familiar. Where project data is hosted has been a concern ever since Software-as-a-Service applications began to be deployed in the 1990s, and as use of construction collaboration platforms expanded in the early 2000s, most leading vendors have responded by creating localised hosting centres to serve different operational regions. Hosting&nbsp; project data in the United States, for example, has been resisted by most clients based in Europe and other parts of the world (eg: the Middle East, southeast Asia, etc; read <em>EE</em> August 2014 post <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2014/08/no-saas-safe-harbor/"><em>No SaaS ‘Safe Harbor’</em></a>).</p>
<p>Concentration of large portions of the construction software industry through merger and acquisition activity has resulted in an increasingly dominant position for US software giants. By gobbling up strong players in Europe, Australasia and elsewhere, Autodesk, Bentley, Oracle and Trimble have assembled strong AEC software portfolios, while some of the more generic US software providers such as Microsoft and IBM have also developed applications, services and relationships that give them an increasingly strong foothold in the AEC space.</p>
<p>And software interoperability has been a perennial issue that <em>EE</em> has covered since it started in 2005 (eg: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2005/09/new_roi_return_/"><em>New ROI: Return on Interoperability</em></a>, September 2005). BuildingSmart (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability) started out as an Autodesk initiative in the mid-1990s, but, over 25 years later, global shifts towards open standards are still proceeding almost glacially slowly, with Autodesk’s leading BIM authoring product “widely ridiculed” for its IFC import/export capabilities.</p>
<h3>Autodesk responds on key themes</h3>

However, a <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up blog post by Amy Bunzsel</a> published today (31 July 2020) addresses the main themes, and on openness and interoperability says: “<strong>We continue to invest in supporting IFC</strong> and based on customer feedback we’ve <strong>recently increased development for new industry requirements, focusing on IFCv4 certification</strong>.”</p>
<p>Bunzsel continues:</p>
<p>“Looking to the future, we believe that ways of working will evolve, from the direct modeling of today to outcome-based design driven by analysis…, to the convergence of manufacturing and construction, and that <strong>data needs to be unlocked from native formats and flow more readily throughout Autodesk and non-Autodesk products</strong>.”</p>
<h3>No more software silos</h3>

<p>The current method of sharing information as files of entire 3D models can hinder collaboration. Tracking changes can also be problematic and inefficient for design communication. AEC Delta Mobility breaks down the file barriers to enable small design changes, known as ‘Deltas’, to be shared faster, more openly and more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the software industry should be working with the construction industry.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>I do hear sometimes from programmers who are kind of sad that they don't have the opportunity to write game engines from scratch like I did and have it matter or make an impact...</p> <p>-John Carmack</p></blockquote> <p>I was definitely a programmer who felt like I'd missed a golden era of opportunity. I didn't <em>really</em> start programming until my 30s. Just like many devs hoping to have an impact on the industry, it's sometimes felt like the golden era has already passed.</p> <p>Surveying the market from a more entreprenurial mindset and looking for a potential niche to fill with a SaaS app (or worse, a social network), the situation appears even more dire! News aggregators have been done and Reddit is thoroughly dominant. The professional social network is done and LinkedIn owns it. Market after market is done. <a href="https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done">Everything in tech is done.</a></p> <h2 id="technology-doesn-t-stay-technology"><a href="#technology-doesn-t-stay-technology">#</a> Technology doesn't stay technology</h2> <p>Part of the problem is the word "tech". There are two different—but overlapping—ideas that are both commonly referred to as "tech".</p> <p>By its literal definition, techonology is anything that involves <em>applying scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em>. In a literal sense, we're surrounded by tech. Some, such as the spoon are ancient and others, like the Kinesis keyboard I'm typing on are much newer.</p> <p>But people don't talk about ancient inventions like the fire bow, or Clovis points as "technology", outside of a historical context. Most people don't even call somewhat modern inventions like light bulbs, refrigerators or microwaves as technology either. When we call something technology, we generally mean something invented recently... <em>or</em> we mean something related to computers.</p> <p>Douglas Adams summed it up into three rules:</p> <ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li> <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li> <li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol> <p>Having a musician turned firmware hacker and then programmer for an uncle, I'm a bit more optimistic about aging and see the boundary as more about whether a given technology has been widespread for a decade or not.</p> <p>Cassette tapes and microwave ovens used to be fantastic new technologies in the late 60s and early 70s. Now they aren't. DVDs, the web and 3D video games used to be amazing technologies in the 90s. Now they're taken for granted. Smart phones were incredible in the late aughts. Now they're just phones.</p> <h2 id="when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing"><a href="#when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing">#</a> When pundits say "tech" they generally mean computing</h2> <p>The rapid advances in personal computing during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s was nothing short of breathtaking. Computers were gaining new powers every year or two and PCs were deprecating nearly 50% per year! The web took the boom to an exponentially growing number of users. [<a href="#1">1</a>]</p> <p>It's entirely natural that computer software dominated the discussion of technology for a generation. First journalists, and now many of us are referring to everything from web SaaS apps to mobile productivity apps as "tech".[<a href="#2">2</a>] Since the wider meaning of tech hasn't been abandoned, this makes it very easy to conflate the two.</p> <p>But not all technology is computing and not all computing is technology anymore.</p> <h2 id="where-is-the-edge"><a href="#where-is-the-edge">#</a> Where is the edge?</h2> <p>To an ambitious engineer looking for a market opportunity in "tech", things look crowded. Advances in programming languages, frameworks, open source collaboration, dev ops, visual site-building tools and more have made it <em>dramatically</em> easier to create both web apps and mobile apps than it was a decade ago. This has lead to a flood of competition and an increased importance of marketing and other skills an engineer might not have.</p> <p>But web apps aren't (necessarily) tech. They're "tech".</p> <p>But not all is lost for the aspiring engineer.</p> <p>There are newer technologies, closer to the frontier that aren't common in in 2020 but will be in 2030. Some of them are still wide open to people with more learning power than earning power. Bio-tech, blockchain, and VR <em>are</em> tech and the technical challenges to be solved are real. It's a lot harder to ship a product in those areas than to build yet another SaaS targeting small to medium sized businesses. But that's a <em>good</em> thing if technical skills are your strength.</p> <p>For those whose strengths lean more to the marketing, sales or design sides, the B2B SaaS may represent a better goal. This is good for everyone. There's vast landscape for different people with different comparative advantages to find their niches.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-too-late"><a href="#you-are-not-too-late">#</a> You are not too late</h2> <blockquote><p>...here's where some perspective really helps - I can remember when I was a teenager, I thought I had missed the Golden Age of 8-bit Apple 2 gaming, that I was never going to be Richard Garriott...time went by, and I got to make my own marks in things after that. And, in that time, I also see so many opportunities that have come by.</p> <p>The 90s PC wave was great - I was happy to be there, and I'm glad I took a swing and knocked one out of the park with that. But since then, we've seen mobile games, and web games, and free-to-play games, the Steam revolution...and now virtual reality. And all of these are amazing!</p> <p>So, yeah, the opportunities that I had aren't there for people today - but there are new and better ones. And personally, I'm more excited about these than anything that's come before. So, thank you very much for this honor, but I'm just getting started.</p> <p>-John Carmack (BAFTA acceptance speech)</p></blockquote> <p>The speech John Carmack gave when accepting his BAFTA fellowship filled me more professional optimism than I've felt in quite a while. Even he felt like it was "too late" because of missing all the opportunities of the 80s.</p> <p>In retrospect, that seems crazy. The web was huge and just around the corner.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">#</a> Notes</h3> <p><a name="1">[1]</a> Well more of an S-curve, but it looked exponential then.</p> <div><p><a name="2">[2]</a> As one commenter on HN </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a><p>, it's a spectrum. In Uber's early days, its technology was crucial to its business. Over time, they'll gradually become less of a tech company if they coast and stop innovating.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently went through the <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a> program and <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">loved it</a>.</p>
<p>But the one sour note was that we only got $1,000 AWS credits when <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">the copy seemed to promise $5,000</a>. Our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-chose-a-marketing-and-app-monorepo">entire application infrastructure is on AWS</a> so those credits are pretty much straight-up cash to us. We don't have much of a digital footprint either, so $5,000 goes a long way.</p>
<p>That's why this weekend was such a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="the-email">The Email</h3>
<p>Here's how the timeline went.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

                                <div><div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor, known for its upscale fashions and&nbsp;extravagant holiday window displays, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors after a turnaround effort faltered amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>

The oldest U.S. department store&nbsp;filed&nbsp;for Chapter 11 protection in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday and will submit a reorganization plan with the court. The company, founded in Manhattan by two English immigrants in 1826, said it had about US$137.9 million&nbsp;of debt obligations.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s owner, fashion&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;Le Tote Inc., filed for Chapter 11 along with the retail chain. Le Tote bought the rights to the companyâ€™s stores, brand and e-commerce site from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. for US$71 million last year.</p><p>

The company, with 38 stores and 651 employees as of the filing, joins a burgeoning list of department-store casualties tied to the virus, which turned malls into ghost towns. Former fashion stalwarts like J. Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus Inc. already filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor closed all of its stores temporarily in March as governors ordered residents to shelter in place to combat the spreading virus. In court filings, company officials said they are slowly starting to reopen some stores and have recalled 400 employees.</p><p>

San Francisco-based Le Tote offers fashion-apparel rentals. Executives at the company have planned to cut the number of Lord &amp; Taylor stores and target younger women with luxury try-on studios, beauty subscriptions and rental drop-off points.</p><p>

Under the deal with Hudsonâ€™s Bay, the seller agreed to cover Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s rent for three years, saving Le Tote $58 million annually. Le Tote said in a court&nbsp;filing&nbsp;Sunday that its companies reported revenue of about US$253.5 million in 2019.</p></div>

<p>The economic body blows wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Le Tote into putting Lord &amp; Taylor into Chapter 11, Ed Kremer, the companyâ€™s chief restructuring officer, said Monday in court filings.</p>

<p>Le Tote officials were grappling with â€œcarrying the increased expenses associated with the acquisition, as well as the brick-and-mortar assets which were unusable for a substantial period of time,â€� Kremer said in the filings. â€œThese unprecedented market developments, compounded by lower-than-expected financial results, adversely impacted liquidityâ€� and left the retailer drowning in debt, he added.</p>

<p>Le Total officials cut a deal with lenders to allow them access to cash to fund an effort to sell the company and â€œmaximize value for all stakeholders,â€� Kremer added.</p>

<p>The case is Le Tote Inc.,&nbsp;20-33332, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9733"><div><div><div><h2>Google acquired North which made smart glasses similar to Google Glass on June 30, North decides to kill its flagship Focals smart glasses on July 31st</h2><p>Last week we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/amazon-allegedly-stealing-tech-from-startups-under-the-pretext-of-funding-them/">reported how Amazon</a> had been accused of using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon allegedly invested in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. Amazon used such confidential information to launch its own services. Google has far worse compared to Amazon.</p><p>On 30th June, Google announced acquiring North, a smart glass maker. Google reportedly paid upwards of $150 million to acquire the Canadian 8-year-old startup, North which started off as Thalmic Labs. North was manufacturing smart glasses called Focals smart glass. At the time of Google’s acquisition, It had started shipping the Focals 1.0 and in the process of developing next-gen, Focals 2.0.</p><p>It seemed natural that Google would be interested in North as its product line was similar to Google Glass. “We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google had said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/google-acquires-north-augmented-reality-glasses-start-up.html">statement that time</a>. “North’s technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.”</p><p>Exactly one month after Google’s acquisition, North has killed off its flagship product.&nbsp;In a statement on the <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">North website</a>, it says that Focals smart glasses will not be sold any longer beginning July 31.&nbsp;“Focals smart glasses and its services are being discontinued and will no longer be available after July 31st, 2020. You won’t be able to connect your glasses through the app or use any features, abilities, or experiments from your glasses,” the statement reads.</p><p>Not only is North killing its flagship Focals 1.0 smart glasses, but it is also stopping work on the upcoming Focals 2.0 completely.&nbsp;The website says that customers who ordered the Focals 1.0 smart glasses after June 30 are provided with a refund.</p><h2>Google’s predatory instincts</h2><p>Google refused to comment on North killing off its Focals 1.0 and 2.0. North (now under Google) also did not give any reason for abandoning its flagship product.</p><p>North hasn’t provided any information on the reasons for abandoning the product. <strong>However, the company had mentioned that Focals 1.0 would be dropped after Google acquires it</strong>. “We’re proud to have grown our company in the Kitchener-Waterloo region and are thankful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the community. We are looking forward to remaining in the region with Google. We are winding down Focals 1.0 and we will not be shipping Focals 2.0, but we hope you will continue the journey with us as we start this next chapter,” North’s co-founders had said when announcing the Google takeover.</p><p>Many will argue that the North got a fresh lease of life, better funding and research facilities from Google but the question is whether Google was ethical in killing off a rival smart glass?</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, some historical background to provide some context. (Meta: There is a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I’ve been an independent/freelance software developer/engineer/consultant/whatchamacallit for 10+ years. All thoughout, I recorded my business activities in an accounting software package (an ancient version of Quickbooks). I did a couple of units in accounting in my undergraduate years so I understood the fundamentals of accounting (assets/liabilities/equity/debit/credit etc.) and the value of having proper financial records. It was easy to do and made sense to me.</p>

<p>In addition to providing software services and consulting to clients, I also dabbled in creating my own startups. Some had moderate success. Some bombed out completely. Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to do ‘bootstrapped’ businesses for quite a while (though maybe it wasn’t known by that term back then).</p>

<p>Then, about 5-6 years ago, an old client of mine asked me to join his new startup. He was very persuasive. So I did.</p>

<p>However, since I was in Australia and the startup company was in California, it was just easier to have a client/consultant relationship than to be an employee. Legally employing me would mean the company would have to incorporate a subsidiary in Australia and all the ensuing hassle that involved.</p>

<p>Nah, too much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained, technically and legally, a consultant/contractor although, for those five years, I worked exclusively for the startup and no one else. But since I was an independent contractor, I had to keep my own books.</p>

<p>And so, I continued to use my accounting software package (which I’m now going to abbreviate to <strong>ASP</strong>) to record the business activities that I did for my ‘boss’. Which was just as well because I still have some recurring revenue from an old SaaS of mine. Those need to be booked as well.</p>

<p>All through the last 10+ years, the ASP been served me well. It’s not perfect, but it was good enough. Quite good for the $80 (ish? It was on special, I think) that I paid for it at the time. However, it was getting quite dated and the license would eventually expire. (I actually have it running in a non-Internet-accessible Windows XP virtual machine. That’s how old it is.)</p>

<p>One day, I was going to have to replace it, or otherwise do something about it, but not yet.</p>

<p>Then, in 2020, the coronavirus/covid-19 pandemic happened. The company I was working for lost funding and folded.</p>

<p>Well …</p>

<p>That was enjoyable: Having a regular a job for 5+ years. And I was getting used to it. What now?</p>

<p>Five years for a tech startup is … tiring (I didn’t expect it to last as long as it did). I didn’t want to rush into looking for another job straightaway. I wanted to take some time off.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks catching-up/reading-up/revising the startup literature. Inevitably, I got drawn back into the ‘bootstrapped business’ game again.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>As the wisdom goes, the way to come up with startup ideas is to ‘notice’ a problem that you have (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the couple of weeks, I tried to ‘go zen’ and notice things. In particular, I tried to notice things which are problems but which my mind would normally just dismiss as ‘that’s just how things are’.</p>

<p>It was a fun time and a challenging exercise to temporarily rewire my brain to look at the world differently. I noticed some things. I brainstormed some ideas. Some were wacky. Most were terrible.</p>

<p>And then I noticed my ancient accounting software package. It’s a problem that’s existed for many years but had always been pushed back as ‘Not now’.</p>

<p>I was surprised. Very. This problem had been dormant for many years. I had just never noticed it before.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more. The software is fine but it needs replacing. Could I create a replacement? How much work would it be? Would anyone else want it? Would they pay for it? I’ve been using it for 10+ years but I only use a small fraction (5%?) of its functionality. Could I improve it by omitting the other 95%? Lots and lots of questions.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do some research around the Internet and I noticed the following: All the major accounting software vendors have gone online/SaaS. SaaS is great for the vendor but, in the case of accounting, it’s terrible for the user. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Business-critical accounting data is stored in the cloud where it’s all controlled by the vendor.</strong> Essentially, the major vendors are forcing small businesses to give up control and then holding the data hostage in return for ongoing SaaS subscription fees. (And it looks like the vendors are getting away with it.)</p>

<p>No way was I, as a user, gonna go with that.</p>

<p>If I was inclined to purchase a replacement for my ASP, I would have trouble finding a suitable one that wasn’t SaaS. I don’t want my business-critical data to be in the cloud. I want it to be in a file on my computer. Furthermore, I don’t want to pay $10-$20 every month to do what, 10 years ago, an $80 product could do for another 10+ years. Think about it: $10-$20 per month vs a $80 one-off fee. It’s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>

<p>So, here, I think, there is a gap in the market. Small and micro-businesses which would otherwise purchase an entry-level ASP are not being well served by the SaaS offerings which are available. (I’m not talking about large businesses which spend much more on accounting software, irrespective of whether it’s SaaS or not. Those are fine.)</p>

<p>So … do I want to go after this market segment?</p>

<p>I’d like to … but I’m not.</p>

<p>Um, why not?</p>

<p>Because I’m just one person. I don’t have the resources/time/funding to go for that.</p>

<p>And anyway, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14046313-start-small-stay-small-a-developer-s-guide-to-launching-a-startup">respected</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book/StartSmallStaySmall">sources</a> recommend starting out as niche as possible (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of targeting the entire market segment, I’m going to go for a niche.</p>

<p>What’s the niche? Well, basically, the niche is … ‘me’ :)</p>

<p>Or rather, the niche would be the characteristics which describe me as a user. So it’d be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator. No employees. No stock. Not a corporation.</li>
  <li>Manage own accounting data. Don’t need an accountant.</li>
  <li>Control over own data. Non-SaaS.</li>
  <li>… and maybe some other stuff that hasn’t manifested yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having used my ASP for 10+ years, I know exactly the feature set that I use. I don’t think I’m anyone special so there should be other people in a situation like mine. In theory, my feature set should be a good match for them too.</p>

<p>So I’ve found, or rather, noticed, a problem and a niche. And the way I’ve defined it, it’s small enough that I can aim a “bootstrapped startup” at it.</p>

<p>Do I wanna go for it?</p>

<p>Yeah, let’s give this a shot and see how things turn out.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-conclusion">TL;DR (conclusion)</h2>

<p>This is why I started GigoBooks: I have an itch to scratch. The itch has been around for <em>several years</em> before I eventually noticed it. It points me to (I think) a market niche which is underserved. I’m going to scratch my itch, and also, create something to serve the niche better. The ‘something’ is a more suitable, more affordable, non-SaaS accounting software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of this year I decided I'd had enough.</p>
<p>I've been writing software and making games since my early teens and for most of my life I've worked on side projects. Some of them made a little money. Others grew a large following. Quite a few failed miserably.</p>
<p>My last project was an open source game development library called <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong></a>. Relative to my previous projects, this project felt very successful. Many hundreds of people starred it on Github. Loads of people joined the Discord chat and it even has it's own tag on Stack Overflow. To this day, people are still using it to make their games.</p>
<p>I always assumed that one day I'd be able to turn it into some side income and maybe eventually replace my full-time job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I always felt like something wasn't quite working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried my very best to help indie game developers make their games. In the beginning the project really resonated with people. Lots of contributors joined to add new features and a community formed around it quite quickly. This felt amazing.</p>
<p>However, this little side project took 5 years of my life. It's the longest amount of time I'd ever spent on anything outside my marriage and kids.</p>
<p>And what did I have to show for it? A bit of pocket money and a whole lot of support requests. As the project got bigger, it put more strain on my limited free time. Eventually it broke me.</p>
<p>Compare that to a game I'd previously published that only took 3 weeks to create and made roughly the same amount of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Then around Christmas I was talking to my dad about his recent retirement. This conversation got me thinking a lot about what I want to do with the next 10 to 20 years of my life. Where do I want to be when I retire?</p>
<p>That's when I decided it was time to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-i-learned-about-failure">The Lesson I Learned about Failure</h2>
<p>After taking some time to reflect on all of my previous projects I realized that failure comes in many forms and some are better than others.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with failure. Not every project works out the way you want and that's okay.</p>
<p>For example, some of my previous projects didn't have <em>market fit</em>. When I launched them into the world, nobody really cared. Luckily when this happens early in the project it's not a big deal. Either discard the idea and move on or figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Another project I started didn't have <em>founder fit</em>. In other words, I initially got excited about the idea and it looked great on paper but over time I really didn't want to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>But the worst kind of failure I've experienced is <em>failure disguised as success</em>. The mistake I made was not recognizing failure early enough. Surprisingly, this was an easy trap to fall into because when it looks like things are working, it feels like just a little more effort will bring everything together.</p>
<p>Unforutnately, more effort applied in the wrong place makes it worse. When the project was small it was easy to manage and I enjoyed working on it everyday. At the time it seemed like a good idea to keep adding more features and watch as more people started using it. But the downside of adding more features is that it becomes increasingly time intensive to fix bugs, update demos, deal with pull requests and respond to questions.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't doing it all for free. I knew at some point I needed to start generating income to be able to dedicate more time to the project. So I launched a Patreon page and immediately had a few people support me finanically. This positive feedback fueled my desire to keep going. Only now, I had another job, creating content to reward my patrons.</p>
<p>I never figured out how to make it work and it was suprisingly difficult to let go.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-was-the-best-thing-i-ever-did">Quitting Was the Best Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>Eventually I decided to stop working on <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and handed the project over to someone else.</p>
<p>At first, this was a really hard decision. It felt like I was throwing away thousands of hours of work and letting down the community around it. But really, it was just a bad case of <strong>sunk cost fallacy.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now firmly believe this was the right choice. The project is still alive and being actively worked on by long time contibutors that use it. Having a new set of eyes on the code base has breathed new life into it.</p>
<p>What I got out of it was a wealth of experience, a chance to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-going-to-do-next">So, What Am I Going To Do Next?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered a whole new world of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">indie hackers</a> creating profitable side projects in their spare time. It's an amazing feeling to find a community of like minded people doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've finally found my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, before I started spending all my time on MonoGame.Extended I built and launched several products. Sometimes they where games and other times it was an app or tool to solve my own problems.</p>
<p>My goal is to get back to my roots. Only this time I've got more experience under my belt. I've learned a lot about building an audience, finding a market, and launching great products.</p>
<p>There's still a mountain of work ahead but I'm excited to be starting the next phase of my journey.</p>
<p>Succeed or fail I'll be writing about it here. If you'd like to see what happens next I'd love to have you on the mailing list below.</p>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I was still a kid, I was always so excited to sit in the front passenger seat on holiday trips. You see, there were no navigation devices yet, and thus we had a physical roadmap. My dad frequently knew the route from memory, but I was eager to follow along on the map (and point out when we could find a quicker or alternative route).</p><p>My excitement for maps has not gone away. It's not coincidental that I'm currently writing about roadmaps in another, similar, sense—product roadmaps.</p><p>In general, the power of a map is to help you get to a destination. But how we create and use product roadmaps is essential. <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-you-should-look-at-everything-as-a-process">It is a process</a> that is both creative and analytical.</p><p>In this series, I aim to guide you through everything you need to know about creating the ultimate product roadmap. In this first installment, I aim to explain what a product roadmap is and why it's such a great tool.</p><h2>What is the purpose of a product roadmap?</h2><p>Let me first tell you what I feel is a good definition of a Product Roadmap, which will help us frame the rest of the points in this guide.</p><blockquote><em>"A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering." - </em><a href="https://www.productplan.com/"><em>ProductPlan</em></a></blockquote><p>We're going to break down the definition step by step, so we understand what it entails.</p><h3><strong>"high-level"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means we don't go into the details of a product vision too much (that's what backlogs are for). We need the roadmap to stay on a strategic level where we can use it to set the course over the long term. To illustrate: think about a ship sailing to some destination. A captain on the vessel needs to look out over the horizon for direction. In contrast, an engineer on the same boat takes care of the machines in the engine room: both necessary for the end goal, but very different levels of focus.</p><h3><strong>"visual"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the product roadmap, like a land roadmap, can be understood without needing to read it (apart from titles, notes, names, etc.). Visual representation helps make the roadmap easier and quicker to understand, which is necessary to get buy-in from everyone involved.</p><h3><strong>"summary"</strong>‍</h3><p>This is similar in the "high-level" part we saw earlier. (Not focus on all the details.) But it does drive home the point that the roadmap should simplify, but definitely not leave out critical parts of the vision. Doing this is hard, especially when a product is big. Note, summarizing is a continuous process.</p><h3><strong>"vision"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the "why" of a product. Why create the product in the first place? What goal does it have? What is the value proposition for users? What is the incentive for the business to create this product? Tip, don't spend a lot of time creating a product roadmap before your vision is crystal clear.</p><h3><strong>"direction"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the execution part of getting to a finished product. It is "how" you go from nothing to providing the value intended. Do I need to say this is important? Well, yes, it is; it is essential. In the execution plan, you find most detail (and struggles) while creating and updating the product roadmap. After you formed a product vision (<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-product-market-fit-is-not-enough">hopefully in line with your customers and your company!</a>), most stakeholders don't sway from that idea. The route to that goal, however, is a bumpy and complicated road. (I'm almost getting ahead of myself in wanting to talk more about this here, but there will be multiple sections where we'll get into the details of this!)</p><h3><strong>"product offering"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means "what" you'll eventually end up creating—the finished product. The whole reason you create a product roadmap is to offer a valuable product to the end-user, your customer.</p><p><em>An interesting aside. Maybe you're already familiar with the last three parts from the definition (vision, direction, and product offering) but under different wording. </em><a href="https://simonsinek.com/"><em>Simon Sinek</em></a><em> talks about the "why, how, and what" (vision, direction, and product offering, respectively). He calls it the "Golden Circle" by his book with the same name.</em></p><h2>What does a product roadmap look like?</h2><p>A product roadmap can take many forms, feature-based, goal-based, time based, release-based, and a few more. But good roadmaps have a few things in common.</p><ul role="list"><li>They are timed based (be it specific dates or timelines).</li><li>They have more detail for near term (higher priority) items than for later (lower priority) items.</li><li>They have 'themes' as the highest level (like "increase customer retention for yearly subscribers"), not features.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's an example of a roadmap (</strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"><strong>source</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><figure id="w-node-47cfe779986d-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5f233514485d617b4cac9b6e_homepage-slider-1-1.png" alt="Roadmap example from roadmunk"></p></figure><p>In the next article, I will walk you through the details of an example product roadmap. As well as listing the different types of product roadmaps that are possible to make. First I'll tell you a bit more about how you can use your roadmap.</p><h2>How can you use a product roadmap?</h2><p>Ok, so now you know what a product roadmap is supposed to do and what it looks like. Right? Well, on a high level, yes. But the utilization of a product roadmap becomes even more evident in the specific cases you use it.</p><p>These are all about people, social dynamics, collaboration, and communication. You can use a product roadmap</p><ol role="list"><li>as a reference document for the (Scrum )team.</li><li>to get stakeholder alignment.</li><li>to provide options for planning and conversation.</li><li>to prevent someone from 'hijacking' your sprints.</li><li>to tell a story to your customers.</li></ol><p>These five uses all come down to the most important reason for creating a product roadmap. To set the narrative of your product vision and execution.</p><blockquote><em>A Product Roadmap is a narrative tool.</em></blockquote><p>With a product roadmap you can tell a story of intent. The intent to build a product towards a certain goal. This narrative is essential to get others to work with you in creating great products.</p><p><em>There is one crucial point I want to drive home. A product roadmap is a living document. The things you plan are not set in stone. The product you're building is undergoing iteration upon iteration. Thus your roadmap should reflect the latest findings and details, especially in the age of Agile and Lean (software) development.</em></p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully, you're now familiar with the idea of what a product roadmap is, why you should use one, and what it looks like.</p><p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or feel something is missing, please do shoot me a message on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/askjibran">Twitter</a>.</p><p>By the way, I also created a checklist with "<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist">40 Product Roadmap tips</a>." So if you can't wait to get into creating and using a product roadmap, I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I launched Feature Upvote, my B2B SaaS, in 2017, the price was $29/month, with a 20% discount for paying yearly. I chose that price  arbitrarily, but also because it is what I felt I would pay for a similar service.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/">hearing repeatedly that developers who start businesses need to charge more</a>, I wanted to experiment with a small increase.</p>
<p>I delayed doing this until I had enough new customers each month to really be sure of the price change’s effect.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I put the price up to $35/month, a 20% increase.</p>
<p>Why such a small increase? I knew in theory that I should charge significantly more, but in practice I wasn’t confident about it. I am, after all, still a developer <img src="https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate stayed roughly the same. That is, the same number of new customers per month, but each paying more.</p>
<p>Nobody complained. Ever. Not a single person questioned the change in our pricing.</p>
<p>A year later, in January 2020 I got bolder. I put the price up to $49/month, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate initially dropped a little but not much. It might have just been statistical noise, or the post-Christmas lull.</p>
<p>I was  getting fewer new customers, but they were paying more. Pricing experts say that customers who pay more tend to remain customers longer, resulting in a much higher customer life time value, so this seemed okay.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic started and we were all in shock and sales stalled for a little while. So it was really hard to tell the true effect of the price increase.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, I’m signing up more new customers than ever, at the conversion rate we had before the price increase.</p>
<p>As with the first price change, nobody complained. Ever.</p>
<h2>What about existing customers?</h2>
<p>I’ve never put up prices for existing customers. I’m okay with people getting the price they started with indefinitely. It is the way I’d want to be treated as a customer. Anyway, within a couple of years, as existing customers churn, the “problem” of older customers paying less will simply go away.</p>
<h2>Has the customer base changed?</h2>
<p>Yes. As the price goes up we tend to get larger organisations as customers. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to ask for custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits. In all cases, I say no. That may change in the future.</p>
<h2>What did I tell existing customers about the price change?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I probably should have, but it fell off my to-do list.</p>
<p>To make sure existing trial customers weren’t shown one price and charged another, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>December 2019: change the prices listed on our pricing page, but still charge new customers the old pricing.</li>
<li>January 2020: start actually charging the new prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other pricing plans</h2>
<p>I have bootstrapper pricing at $19/month (with a 20% discount when paying yearly). I’ve had this pricing since the very start, and never changed it. It is an easy way to answer would-be customers who write “I want to use Feature Upvote, but it is too expensive for me.”</p>
<p>For charities or non-profits who ask, we have a plan that’s 25% cheaper. Almost no-one asks for this plan. I don’t know why, because it is featured on our pricing page.</p>
<p>Just about any Open Source project that asks can use us for free. There are a couple of stipulations, but I tend not to check too carefully.</p>
<h2>Do I charge enough?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m content with the pricing now, and have no plans to change it in the near future. Next year I might add a much more expensive enterprise plan, for those people who ask about custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits.</p>

		<p>When it comes to recruitment interviews, there's an overwhelmingly popular opinion (on the Internet) that one should test candidates in conditions that do resemble <strong>real-life work scenarios</strong> as much as possible. Tasks &amp; challenges should mimic the ones that the candidate would face in her/his daily work. Everything else (<em>"how many golf balls would fit into Opel Corsa?"</em>) is the subject of laughter and mockery.</p><p>I dare to disagree. My interviews are nothing like real work (but TBH we have a final stage of a "trial day" within the actual team, mainly to check <em>the chemistry</em> between a potential new-joiner and the team members and to give her/him a chance to verify what we've said about the company).</p><p>A recruitment interview is a freaking intense experience. We have a strictly limited time - we can't build full context to get someone up-to-speed with the product details, local specifics, whole workflow, etc. Of course, we can try easy, shallow, "mundane" scenario, but let's face the truth - we need to evaluate candidate's capability to tackle TRULY demanding stuff (most likely <strong>10% of the actual work</strong> (s)he'll perform - but that part truly makes the difference).</p><p>The purpose of the interview is not to emulate work 1:1, but to answer certain questions: about particular personality traits, attitude, aptitude, mindset. Technical skills can always be taught later - if someone has a matching motivation, proper engineering foundation, is bright enough and has an ability of structured abstract thinking.</p><p>That's why my interviews are aimed to check how does the individual think (instead of verifying her/his memorization skills). How does (s)he approach problems, split them, classify them, explore possible solutions? When does (s)he abandon the path that doesn't look promising anymore? Is (s)he able to effectively share her/his thoughts (verbally, graphically, in code)? What about focus - does (s)he navigate in terms of a given goal or roam chaotically around? And in the end ... <strong>is (s)he actually having fun</strong> (when solving challenging problems)?</p><p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do ask abstract questions as well. The problems candidates are facing at my interviews usually have NOTHING in common with the company's domain, BUT they have a super-low entry level (e.g. they are about common problems everyone encounters every day): building up the context takes seconds (literally), so the candidate can focus on tackling the problem, not understanding its basics. They also share one another characteristic: they are picked to be <strong>unique, intriguing and memorable</strong> - so regardless of the outcome (whether the candidate joins us or not), our interview remains an interesting experience in her/his memory.</p><p>There are ones who are surprised and do criticize such a form of the interview. They usually ask whether these exercises truly represent the everyday problems of this organization. Some even get irritated (very few) - but no-one has asked to stop the interview prematurely.</p><p>Honestly, I don't mind. These days candidates get very picky - they have so many offers available in the market, that the less gritty ones don't even want to participate in the interview that exposes them to the challenges out of their comfort zone (e.g. which is - syntactical language problems or knowing the specifics of the framework). It's their right, but it also means they are definitely <strong>not the people I'm looking for</strong>.</p><hr><p>P.S. Of course, sometimes (rarely) I look for a high level of expertise within a specific technological niche - that requires a different assessment and it's a completely separate topic.</p>

Over the same period of time they have created a wide range of computer vision and data analysis tools which have the potential to change forms of policing and incarceration in many places around the world. These innovations, however, have come at the cost of what U.S. lawmakers describe as “</span><a href="https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/EMBARGOED_CECC%202019%20Annual%20Report.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">crimes against humanity</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.”</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Technology’s Double-Edged Sword</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that Chinese technology companies are at the cutting edge of surveillance innovation and predictive analytics. In April 2020, Amazon, the wealthiest technology company in the world, received a shipment of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL"><span data-contrast="none">1,500 heat-sensing camera systems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;from the Chinese surveillance company&nbsp;Dahua. Many of these cameras, which are worth approximately $10 million, will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit COVID-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017,&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;received over $900 million to build comprehensive surveillance systems which supported a “re-education” system of extra-legal internment, checkpoints, and ideological training for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision"><span data-contrast="none">Muslim populations in northwestern China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed it on a list of companies banned from buying or selling in the United States. Yet despite the legal and ethical ramifications of buying products from&nbsp;Dahua, Amazon continues to do business with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the help of&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;and hundreds of other private and public Chinese companies, as many as 1.5 million Uighurs and Kazakhs have been “disappeared” into a widespread system of “re-education camps” in the Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).[1]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Nearly all Uighurs and Kazakhs in China have an immediate family member who is, or has been, interned in this camp system. Uighurs now refer to themselves as a “</span><a href="https://livingotherwise.com/2018/07/31/happiest-muslims-world-coping-happiness/"><span data-contrast="none">people destroyed</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.” As I observed during a research trip to the region in 2018, many Uighur-owned businesses have closed across the country. Whole streets have been abandoned in Uighur towns and villages. Because of the re-education system, it is likely that within a single generation Muslim embodied practice and Turkic languages in Northwest China will cease to provide essential ways for Uighurs and Kazakhs to sustain their knowledge systems.[2]&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This process affects every aspect of their lives not only due to mass detentions, but also because of the way biometric and data surveillance systems supporting the camps have been used to monitor and transform their behavior.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[3]</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This terrain assessment describes how Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang were targeted by digital and biometric surveillance technologies of the “re-education” system. Its main conclusion is that the world is witnessing the birth of a new form of technology-enabled systems of social and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">behavioral control. This rise in authoritarian statecraft coincides with breakthroughs in face surveillance, voice recognition, automated data recovery tools and algorithmic assessments of social media histories in China’s private and public technology industry.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many of the dozens of former detainees and inhabitants of the region I interviewed while researching the technological aspects of the re-education system said that they or those they knew were detained because of digital texts, audio clips, and videos that they had shared on their smartphones.</span><span data-contrast="auto">iv</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">In numerous cases, former detainees told me they met people in the camps who&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/provocations/coercive-reeducation-technologies-actually-work/"><span data-contrast="none">were detained</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;because they had used their ID card to register multiple SIM cards, they had installed Facebook or WhatsApp on their Android phones, or they had used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to circumvent China’s “great firewall.” All of these “pre-crimes” could be construed as part of a list of 75&nbsp;</span><a href="http://archive.fo/TlazC"><span data-contrast="none">official signs of Islamic extremism</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Police departments across the region began to employ “police contractors” to check people’s devices using artificial intelligence-enabled auto-recovery tools built by the Chinese tech giant&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Meiya</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Pico and others.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[4]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">State workers and automated data collection systems&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">fed this information</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;into a region-wide&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP)</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Authorities used this system, along with data collected through interrogations, to determine which Muslims were “unsafe” and in need of&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">detention</span><span data-contrast="auto">.[5]</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Inside the formal “re-education camps,” detainees were subjected to comprehensive monitoring.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[6]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">The lights inside their cells were extremely bright. They were never turned off.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">In&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">interviews, former detainees</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;who were held in camps across the region told me that at no point during the day or night were detainees permitted to obscure the view of their faces from the cameras. If they covered their eyes with their hand or a&nbsp;blanket&nbsp;they would receive an immediate warning from a guard via the speaker system in the cell.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">People who were not immediately detained were nevertheless ordered to go to local police stations and clinics to submit blood and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions">DNA samples</a> have their irises, faces and fingerprints scanned and a unique voice signature recorded.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">One Kazakh woman told me, “The village government leader told us openly that those who refused would be taken to the re-education camps.” This biometric data was then added to their citizenship file as part of a new “smart” ID card system. Once this system was fully implemented by the end of 2017, it became impossible for Uighurs and Kazakhs to enter a bank or shopping mall without having their face scanned and matched to the image on their ID at fixed checkpoints. Han people were often waved through these checkpoints without a scan,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chinachannel.org/2018/11/23/checkpoint-nation/"><span data-contrast="none">particularly in Turkic Muslim majority areas</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The Kazakh woman told me, “On average, over the span of a single day, I had my ID and face scanned more than 10 times.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is unclear how all of this data is used. As James&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Leibold</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;has noted, there is likely a significant gap between the advertised capacities of the systems in place and their actual ability to turn biometric and digital data into actionable forms of social control.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[9]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Much of the data in the IJOP system is input manually or through targeted scans of smart phones, while other forms of data are fed into the system through banking records, GPS tracking and license plate and face recognition camera systems. Yet despite potential gaps in purported knowledge and technical capability, the ubiquity of checkpoints and cameras make Turkic Muslims modify their behavior in their daily life and reorient their activities around ideals promoted by state authorities. The technologies begin to create a new reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Logic of Chinese Counterterrorism&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The history of Chinese counterterrorism is born largely out of post-9/11 counterinsurgency theory (COIN). Soon after U.S. Army General Petraeus crafted a new counterinsurgency field manual in 2007, Chinese military and policing scientists began to consider what they could learn from a <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2019/10/25/preventative-policing-as-community-detention-in-northwest-china/">new approach</a> to asymmetrical warfare.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">They considered central COIN principles such as full spectrum intelligence; placing people in categories of insurgent, neutral, and pro-regime change populations; breaking up social networks through targeted detentions; and “winning the hearts and minds” of those who remained.[10]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As elements of counterinsurgency theory were implemented in the United States and Europe in the form of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs that strove to “deradicalize” Muslim citizens, Chinese policing theorists began to think more about “preventative policing” and the way surveillance and education systems could be used to transform non-Han Muslim populations.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[11]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Building on an intelligence-led policing program called&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">the Golden Shield project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that had already been established post-9/11, they took note of Edward Snowden’s revelations of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"><span data-contrast="none">PRISM mass data analytics project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that collected and assessed data from social media both in the United States and around the globe.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

<h3 id="enable-performance-mode">Enable performance mode</h3>
<p>The systems UEFI or BIOS usually have a setting for energy profile that adjusts
available CPU power states, you should set this to “maximum performance” or
equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="disable-hyper-threading">Disable hyper-threading</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Hyper-threading (HT)</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</a>
is a technology to maximize processor resource usage for workloads with low
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle">instructions per cycle (IPC)</a>.
Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources it’s recommended to
turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources. Disabling HT/SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of
2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>
<h3 id="enable-turbo-boost">Enable Turbo Boost</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="overclocking">Overclocking</h3>
<p>Consider overclocking your processors. Running your processor at higher
frequency will reduce jitter and latency. It’s not possible to overclock Intel
Xeon server processors, but you can overclock Intel’s consumer gaming processors
and AMD’s processors.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts
</code></pre><p>References:</p>

<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a
</code></pre><p>Your application will still incur major page faults when accessing <em>file backed
memory mappings</em> …</p></div></div>

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this <code>grayify_cmap</code> snippet helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10dc06ec-da7f-4513-8b37-6c17f9f48df5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195239Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8e0371bdd6fe0b12f7ac92c0736c17cd0b656d4058c36f38692590967a3d03b8&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cc718120-451e-45f4-99c1-09cbde8627c1/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195107Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7e22925f4c8f52d02ee569f3093de6861ed0aefe5b79db1c1a163a9cd1e0ce8a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cbfe0681-f35f-475a-be81-4dda8603de98/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195127Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0e89220104974d5015b313efa4866b04c500b97dd8c7e3ae10e3ab52778f622f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ee2cde0-474d-4bb9-aee6-82e8408587e9/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195152Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=545de8bbe5c384fca3b4668795bca49bbb3a3fc6c79e24d9562a517907b44628&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p> <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

<p>Tools shape both their user and their result.
Paradigms of C and C++ have molded generations of systems programmers, the ubiquity and staying power of both languages is a testament to their utility.
But the resultant software has suffered decades of <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">memory corruption CVEs</a>.</p>
<p>Rust, as a compiled language <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">without garbage collection</a>, supports what have traditionally been C/C++ domains.
This includes everything from high-performance distributed systems to microcontroller firmware.
Rust offers an alternative set of paradigms, namely <a href="https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/01/27/rust-ownership-by-example/">ownership and lifetimes</a>.
If you've never tried Rust, imagine pair programming alongside a nearly-omniscient but narrowly-focused perfectionist.
That's what the borrow checker, a compiler component implementing the ownership concept, can sometimes feel like.
In exchange for the associated learning curve, we get memory safety guarantees.</p>
<p>Like many in the security community, I've been drawn to Rust by the glittering promise of a safe alternative.
But what does "safe" actually mean on a technical level?
Is the draw one of moths to flame, or does Rust fundamentally change the game?</p>
<p>This post is my attempt to answer these questions, based on what I've learned so far.
Memory safety is a topic knee-deep in operating system and computer architecture concepts, so I have to assume formidable prior systems security knowledge to keep this post short-ish.
Whether you're already using Rust or are just flirting with the idea, hope you find it useful!</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-the-memory-safety-guarantees-in-terms-of-exploitability">What exactly are the "memory safety guarantees"? In terms of exploitability?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the good news. Rust largely prevents a major vector for information leakage and malicious code execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack protection:</strong> Classic stack-smashing is now an <em>exception</em> and not <em>memory corruption</em>; attempts to write past the end of a buffer will trigger a panic instead of leading to <em>buffer overflow</em>. Regardless of panic handling logic (e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-reset"><code>panic_reset</code></a>), your application could still be subject to <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attacks. This is why fuzzing Rust is <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/fuzzing-sequoia/">still worthwhile</a>. But, as the panic prevents attacker-controlled stack corruption, you won't fall victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">Arbitrary or Remote Code Execution (ACE and RCE, respectively)</a>. Attempts to read past the end of a buffer are similarly stopped, so <a href="https://blog.getreu.net/projects/embedded-system-security-with-Rust/">no Heartbleed-style bugs</a>. Enforcement is dynamic: the compiler inserts runtime bounds checks where necessary, incurring small performance overhead. Bounds checks are more effective than the stack cookies a C compiler might insert because they still apply when indexing linear data structures, an operation that's easier to get right with Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html">iterator APIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heap protection:</strong> Bounds checks and panic behavior still apply to <a href="https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/">heap-allocated</a> objects. In addition, the ownership paradigm eliminates dangling pointers, preventing <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html">Use-After-Free (UAF)</a> and <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html">Double-Free (DF)</a> vulnerabilities: heap metadata is never corrupted. Memory leaks (meaning never freeing allocations, not over-reading data) are still possible if a programmer creates <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html">cyclical references</a>. Compile-time static analysis does the enforcement, soundly reasoning about abstract states representing all possible dynamic executions. There is no runtime cost. Effectiveness is maximal: the program simply can't enter a bad state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References are always valid and variables are initialized before use:</strong> safe Rust doesn't allow manipulation of raw pointers, ensuring that pointer dereferences are valid. This means no <code>NULL</code> dereferences for DoS and no pointer manipulation for control flow hijack or arbitrary read/write. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><code>Option</code> type</a> facilitates error handling when <code>NULL</code> is a concept the programmer wishes to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization">logically express</a>. These are compile-time guarantees, courtesy of ownership and lifetimes. A similar compile-time guarantee ensures variables can't be read until they've been initialized. Use of uninitialized variables is a warning in most modern C compilers; that aspect isn't novel. But ensuring valid dereferences certainly is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data races are completely eliminated:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures that any given variable can only have one writer (e.g. a mutable reference) at any given program point, but an unlimited number of readers (e.g. immutable references). In addition to enabling memory safety, this scheme solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem">classic readers-writers concurrency problem</a>. Thus Rust eliminates data races, sometimes without the need for synchronization primitives or reference counting - but not <a href="https://youtu.be/ADbCqH7_SAs?t=669">race conditions in general</a>. Data race prevention reduces opportunities for <a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/publications/papers/Concurrency_Attacks.pdf">concurrency attacks</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All good things in life come with a caveat. Let's look at the fine print:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not all Rust code is memory safe:</strong> Satisfying the compiler's analyses is part of what makes implementing certain data structures, like <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html">doubly-linked lists</a>, challenging in Rust. Moreover, certain low-level operations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO)</a>, are difficult to <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/register-rs">fully analyze</a> for safety. Blocks of code marked as <code>unsafe</code> are manually-designated "blindspots" for the analyses, bypassing safety-specific checks since the programmer vouches for their correctness. This includes parts of Rust's standard library, for which <a href="https://gts3.org/2019/cve-2018-1000657.html">CVE numbers have been assigned</a>, and, by extension, any external libraries called via C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">Foreign Function Interface</a> (CFFI). Furthermore, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03296">researchers have found</a> that ownership's automatic destruction can create new (meaning unique to Rust) UAF and DF patterns in <code>unsafe</code> code. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-silvestro.pdf">Hardened allocators</a>, which check heap consistency invariants dynamically, aren't entirely obsolete. Memory safety guarantees apply <em>broadly</em>, not <em>universally</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>unsafe</code> drops memory safety guarantees for a limited scope and doesn't eliminate all checks:</strong> <code>unsafe</code> isn't a free-for-all. Type, lifetime, and reference checks are still active; high-risk operations have explicit APIs (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked"><code>get_unchecked</code></a>). While memory corruption is possible with <code>unsafe</code>, the possibility is constrained to small portions of your codebase - around 1% of a typical Rust library <a href="https://youtu.be/NQBVUjdkLAA?t=1413">by one estimate</a>. From a security audit perspective, that's a colossal reduction in attack surface for a major bug class. Think of <code>unsafe</code> as a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</a> in a larger system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interior mutability can push borrow checks to runtime:</strong> the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">interior mutability pattern</a> allows multiple mutable aliases to a single memory location so long as they're not in use simultaneously. It's a sidestep of the borrow checker, a fallback when the problem can't be <a href="https://crates.io/crates/indextree">reframed in an idiomatic way</a> for powerful compile-time guarantees. Safe <em>wrappers</em> for <code>unsafe</code> APIs (e.g. <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) verify exclusivity at runtime, incurring a performance penalty and introducing the potential to panic. I couldn't find metrics on how widely used this pattern is or isn't, but would again recommend <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl/tutorial.html">fuzzing</a> for probabilistic panic detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, decades of hardware, OS, and compiler-level defenses have hardened C and C++ deployments.
Memory corruption 0-days aren't exactly low-hanging fruit.
Yet Rust still feels like a significant step forward and a noteworthy improvement to the security posture of performance-critical software.
Even though the <code>unsafe</code> escape hatch must exist, memory corruption - a large and vicious bug class - is largely eliminated.</p>
<p>So is Rust the new messiah, sent to save us from the hell of remote shell?
Definitely not.
Rust won't stop command injection (e.g. part of an input string ending up as an argument to <code>execve</code>).
Or misconfiguration (e.g. fallback to an insecure cipher).
Or logic bugs (e.g. forgetting to verify user permissions).
No general purpose programming language will make your code inherently secure or formally correct.
But at least you don't have to worry about these kinds of mistakes <em>and</em> maintaining <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/">complex, invisible memory invariants</a> throughout your Rust codebase.</p>
<h2 id="ok-what-about-embedded-systems-aren-t-those-super-vulnerable">OK, what about embedded systems? Aren't those super vulnerable?</h2>
<p>Let's assume "embedded" means no OS abstractions; the software stack is a single, monolithic binary (e.g. AVR or Cortex-M firmware) or part of the OS itself (e.g. kernel or bootloader). Rust's <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/m4vga-in-rust/#on-no-std"><code>!#[no_std]</code> attribute</a> facilitates developing for embedded platforms.
<code>!#[no_std]</code> Rust libraries typically forsake dynamic collections (like <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code>) for portability to baremetal environments (no memory allocator, no heap).
The borrow checker barrier is minimal without dynamic memory, so prototyping ease remains roughly equivalent to embedded C - albeit with <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html">fewer</a> supported <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/specific.html">architectures</a>.</p>
<p>The resource-constrained and/or real-time embedded systems <code>!#[no_std]</code> targets often lack modern mitigations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvug1Hup2iA">a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), No eXecute (NX), or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</a>.
We're talking about a lawless land where memory is flat and no one can hear you segfault.
But Rust still gives us that sweet, sweet bound check insurance when running baremetal without an allocator.
That's noteworthy because it might be the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> line of defense in an embedded scenario.
Just remember that low-level interaction with hardware will probably require some amount of <code>unsafe</code> code, in which memory access without bounds check is opt-in.</p>
<p>For x86/x64, <em>stack probes</em> are also inserted by Rust the compiler to detect <em>stack overflow</em>.
At present, this feature doesn't apply to <code>!#[no_std]</code> or other architectures - although <a href="https://blog.japaric.io/stack-overflow-protection/">creative linking solutions</a> have been suggested.
Stack probes, often implemented via guard pages, prevent exhausting stack space due to unending recursion.
Bounds checks, on the other hand, prevent stack or heap-based <em>buffer overflow</em> bugs.
It's a subtle distinction, but an important one: for security, we typically care far more about the latter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that memory, from the perspective of Rust, is a software abstraction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I was looking at one of my classic Macs a few weeks ago, and noticed that my Ubuntu 18.04 netatalk server wasn’t showing up in the Chooser anymore. If you’re not familiar with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">netatalk</a>, it’s an implementation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol" target="_blank">Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)</a> that runs on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and NetBSD. It allows other operating systems to act as Mac file servers. Version 2.x, which I use, supports the ancient AppleTalk protocol. This allows it to work with really old classic Macs that don’t even have a TCP/IP stack installed. Support for AppleTalk was removed in version 3.x, so that’s why I’m still using 2.x.</p>



<p>I checked out the server, and noticed that atalkd wasn’t running.</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>3351 pts/0 R+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Hmmm….why wouldn’t atalkd be running? I went ahead and tried to restart netatalk:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>Job for netatalk.service failed because the control process exited with error code.<br>See "systemctl status netatalk.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.</pre>



<p>Uh oh! Why won’t netatalk start?</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ systemctl status netatalk.service<br>● netatalk.service<br>Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/netatalk; generated)<br>Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sat 2020-08-01 10:29:36 PDT; 54s ago<br>Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)<br>Process: 1320 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/netatalk start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)<p>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Starting netatalk.service…<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: Starting Netatalk services (this will take a while): socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: atalkd: can't get interfaces, exiting.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Control process exited, code=exited status=1<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Failed to start netatalk.service.</p></pre>



<p>This setup had been working forever. What could have possibly changed? I was keeping up to date with all of my Ubuntu updates. I had already needed to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netatalk/+bug/1839015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manually patch the netatalk binary due to another bug</a>. Maybe I needed to reapply the patch? But no, the netatalk binary hadn’t been updated. That wasn’t it.</p>



<p>I tried some Googling and noticed that recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=6cc03e8aa36c51f3b26a0d21a3c4ce2809c842ac" target="_blank">AppleTalk had been patched so that you can’t create raw sockets without the CAP_NET_RAW capability</a>, so I fiddled with setcap to set that capability on the atalkd binary, but that didn’t seem to fix anything, so I undid all the capability changes I tested.</p>



<p>After further experimentation, I realized that the appletalk kernel module wasn’t being loaded:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ lsmod | grep appletalk<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Naturally, I tried to load it myself:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo modprobe appletalk<br>modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'appletalk': Cannot allocate memory</pre>



<p>Aha! There’s the real problem. Why can’t it allocate memory? I wondered if it was something specific to this particular machine. To test my theory, I headed over to my desktop Linux machine and ran the same modprobe command. It failed with the exact same error.</p>



<p>At this point after trying to do more research, I gave up for a while because I had more important stuff to worry about. It’s kind of difficult to search for info about this type of problem, because hardly anybody is using the AppleTalk networking layer in Linux anymore. “There are dozens of us!”</p>



<p>I finally came back and did some more troubleshooting. Since I knew it had worked before, I tried installing various kernel versions in a VM. Sure enough, Ubuntu’s 5.0.0 kernel worked fine. So this was definitely a kernel issue if I wasn’t already convinced.</p>



<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of upstream kernel versions</a>. I narrowed the problem down to sometime between kernels 5.0 and 5.1-rc1. Then I ran a git bisect between those versions, following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructions on the Ubuntu wiki for bisecting upstream kernels</a>. I also used “make localmodconfig” (followed by enabling appletalk in “make menuconfig”) to speed up the compile process after I noticed that most of the compile time was being spent building kernel modules that I wouldn’t be loading anyway.</p>



<p>The bisect process took quite a while. I probably should have figured out a way to automate it with qemu using a strategy similar to the one used in <a href="https://ldpreload.com/blog/git-bisect-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this excellent blog post</a>. But nevertheless, it finally settled on this commit from March 2019 being the start of the problem:</p>



<p><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac] appletalk: Fix use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit</a></p>



<p>This commit simply does a better job of checking return values of the functions called by atalk_init, and cleaning up properly if they fail. In particular, the return values of these functions, which were previously ignored, are now checked to ensure they succeed:</p>



<ul><li>sock_register</li><li>register_netdevice_notifier</li><li>atalk_proc_init</li><li>atalk_register_sysctl</li></ul>



<p>Further inspection revealed atalk_proc_init as the real culprit. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=e2bcd8b0ce6ee3410665765db0d44dd8b7e3b348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A refactor of atalk_proc_init, which happens to be the previous commit to the one linked above</a>, accidentally left the code in a state where it would return -ENOMEM instead of 0 on success. So it always returns -ENOMEM, regardless of success or failure. This explains the “Cannot allocate memory” error being reported when I attempted to insert the appletalk module.</p>



<p>Armed with this info, I did something really disgusting. I made a copy of the kernel module in /tmp and hacked it by tweaking bytes in a hex editor. A disassembly of atalk_proc_init reveals a line of code that loads a value of 0xFFFFFFF4 (-12) into the EAX register just before it exits. ENOMEM is defined as 12. So this is the line that’s causing it to return -ENOMEM. I simply hacked this line to load 0 into EAX instead. This basically leaves the logic working the same way it used to work before the two aforementioned patches were applied, because the return value was previously being ignored anyway.</p>



<p>Before:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 f4 ff ff ff          mov $0xfffffff4,%eax</pre>



<p>After:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov $0x0,%eax</pre>



<p>This hack by itself didn’t solve the problem:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>insmod: ERROR: could not insert module /tmp/appletalk.ko: Key was rejected by service</pre>



<p>The problem here is that Ubuntu’s kernel modules are signed. After hacking the binary, it no longer matched its signature. This is an indicator of just how ugly my hack is. So I did something even uglier: I stripped the signature out of the module completely:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ strip --strip-debug /tmp/appletalk.ko</pre>



<p>Then, I tried loading it again:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Success! My dmesg log reports an error about a failed signature, thus tainting the kernel:</p>



<pre>[ 4479.495054] appletalk: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel</pre>



<p>But this doesn’t matter for my purposes. netatalk works now:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>1698 ? S 0:00 /usr/sbin/atalkd<br>1716 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Now I can store the hacked version of the module in the correct subdirectory in /lib/modules, and everything works automatically when I reboot. Yay!</p>



<p>This is a really ugly fix though. Whenever I upgrade my kernel, I’m going to have to manually patch it. That is, until the patch hits the mainline kernel, and then I can hope that Ubuntu pulls the fix into their kernel. The reason I’m documenting the binary patch here is because realistically, it’s going to take forever for the kernel fix to get released. I have no idea if it will be possible to convince Ubuntu to pull this fix into their kernels once it’s released. It’s not a high-priority bug fix because nobody uses AppleTalk anymore. And I don’t want to limit myself to an old kernel just for this silly reason.</p>



<p>So the first step here is to submit the patch to the linux-netdev mailing list, and get the fix merged into the mainline kernel. I searched the mailing list, and discovered that I wasn’t the first one to run into this bug. Actually, two separate people have both tried to fix it, but had their patches rejected for minor reasons:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=157058496118854&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a><ul><li>In this case, someone submitted a patch 10 months ago and was asked to tweak the patch. Then life got in the way (I totally understand), and he finally tried again about 9 months later:</li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159403465307674&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH v2] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a></li><li>He was also asked to tweak the second patch because of a minor style issue (which I also understand). A third try at submitting the patch hasn’t been attempted as of this writing.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159541831715585&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH 1/2] appletalk: Fix atalk_proc_init return path</a><ul><li>This is a more recent attempt from someone else, about a week and a half ago as of this writing. The author submitted this fix together with another unrelated AppleTalk patch, and the patch set was rejected for various minor issues (also understandable). A second version hasn’t been submitted as of this writing.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Obviously not too many people are using the appletalk kernel module these days, or else people would be up in arms about how it has been broken since kernel 5.1. I would offer up my own third attempt at getting this patch merged, but since two attempts were made just last month, I suspect one of them will succeed shortly. I hope so, anyway. In the meantime, I guess I’ll just continue binary patching my kernel module.</p>



<p>I think there is an even bigger long-term solution than this kernel fix. Classic Mac users who use netatalk with AppleTalk need to join forces to address a few things. netatalk 2.x is dead, but the last release of it is broken on Linux, at least the AppleTalk portion of it — which is the only reason I would still use it. Maybe we …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Usually I sit down and write these in one pass. This month I kept <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> open in a window for a while and just took notes on thoughts, in in sort of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Matt Levine</a>-esque <a href="https://www.philma.me/projects/everything-is-securities-fraud">style</a>.</p><h3 id="the-pareto-principle-for-engineering-difficulty">The pareto principle for engineering difficulty</h3><p>Once you’re settled in, 95% of programming isn’t hard. It doesn’t involve algorithms, hard design problems, performance or storage constraints. It isn’t worth blogging about.</p><p>5% or less of programming is hard: it’s the stuff that interview questions refer to. You might need to think about <em>algorithms</em>, might need to try out multiple strategies before deciding on the one.</p><p>It’s easy to screw up the 95%, though - by bad day-to-day engineering practices, by overcomplicating problems, and lots of other ways. It’s common to screw up the 95%, and the numbers work out that you have plenty of bugs in systems that are doing ‘easy’ things.</p><p>We should balance our attention for the majority of easy tasks and the minority of hard ones. Why do interviews only ask about knowledge that you need a few times a year, and not about habits you need every day? Should we use a language or platform that makes the routine code convenient, or the impressive code more impressive?</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><blockquote><p>We are all sufferers from history, but the paranoid is a double sufferer, since he is afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us, but by his fantasies as well.</p></blockquote><p>I finally read <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/">The Paranoid Style in American Politics, the famous 1964 piece by Richard Hofstadter</a>.</p><p>It’s still relevant but I think two things have changed about the paranoid style:</p><ul><li>The paranoid people are winning. In Hofstadter’s time they were a marginal viewpoint: now they’re the default. The radius of QAnon and other fringe theories is staggeringly large right now. Even folks who don’t identify with Q casually accept many of its idiotic theories.</li><li>The obsession with citing facts in paranoid literature that Hofstadter mentions is no longer a thing: modern paranoia is untethered.</li></ul><h3 id="here-is-a-mild-take-on-javascript">Here is a mild take on JavaScript</h3><p>Using objects for data is one of the worst things about JavaScript. It’s really nice in other languages that you have one kind of object that’s part of your application and another that’s used for representing data. Ruby’s Hash, Python’s Dictionary, Java’s many datatypes, etc. JavaScript, traditionally, uses the same basic idea to represent all kinds of objects.</p><p>Basically every time that someone tries to use JavaScript objects for data, they write a security vulnerability by way of prototype pollution. The <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> datatypes help with this, but their relative unpopularity and inability to be directly serialized into JSON - and the fact that most developers are late to learn about them - means that a lot of people are just using objects for everything. And that’s, really often, a problem.</p><h3 id="the-core-cool-idea">The core cool idea</h3><p>My usual advice for <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/08/25/side-projects.html">finishing side projects</a> includes some variation on “be relentless about simplicity,” which translates into avoiding feature creep. The inverse is more instructive, though: know what the cool part is. For example, this month I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1282123824901681153">made a small multiples visualization of a YouTube channel</a> that the internet generally liked. I made the project in one sitting and spent the last 45 minutes trying to make it interactive, so that you could click on the videos or hover over them and hear audio from each one. I was annoyed at this process because I was trying to implement it in a simple and lightweight way, and there was none. But I decided to avoid it: because making the thing interactive was too much work, but because I knew that what I had already made was the cool part. The interactivity might make it 10% cooler, but I had already done was the embodiment of the driving question, the implementation of the core cool idea.</p><p>Know what the core cool idea is. Side projects need one. If the core idea isn’t cool, you won’t be able to make the project cool by adding more stuff.</p><h3 id="politics">Politics</h3><p>I’m working through <a href="https://librivox.org/progress-and-poverty-by-henry-george/">Henry George’s Progress and Poverty as a free audiobook</a>, which has influenced my political-economic leanings from a distance for a while.</p><p>I think a bit about housing nowadays. I live in a major city with a housing crisis. Every single major American city has a housing crisis. Here’s one of my thoughts that I’m trying to refine:</p><p>Housing is both <em>real</em> (it can be used) and capital (it is a store of value). In coastal cities, owning a $1M house is more similar to owning $1M of stock than it is to owning $1M of cars or computers. The real goods depreciate in value quickly, the house is expected to gain value. Buying &amp; selling the car is like buying &amp; selling another real good, whereas the trading in real estate has stock-like tax advantages. But unlike more commonly accepted forms of capital (like stocks or bonds), the appreciation of the house is supposedly natural. When its value decreases, we pity the owner, whereas we tend to see crashing stocks as an ‘expected risk’.</p><p>Housing doesn’t have to be have so much like capital, and in many places it isn’t. But in America it does: both the political left and right are attached to the idea of housing being a wealth creation strategy.</p><p>The take is: housing can’t simultaneously produce wealth, be a safe investment, and be produced in enough quantity to avert crises. That’s the punchline. We want it to be part of two exclusive categories. It can’t, and most people end up advantaging the investment characteristics over the thing-people-need-to-live-in ‘real good’ characteristics.</p><p>To solve the housing crisis, we need to make housing worse, as an investment.</p><h3 id="the-answer-to-everything-is-maybe">The answer to everything is maybe</h3><p>Reading <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium/types?share_key=baf6b67369843fa2">types: a programmers compendium</a> really drives home the point that <em>most bright-line definitions in software engineering aren’t real.</em> What a ‘strong type system’ <em>is</em> is really poorly defined. Same with a lot of concepts – things like ‘functional programming’ are more styles than they are categories.</p><p>Even ideas about performance aren’t really… real. Many languages have different implementations of, say, sorting, depending on data types and list lengths: saying “sorting is O(n log n)” is really a gamble.</p><p>Is HTML a programming language? The answer is <em>sort of</em>? You can do logic in it, like you can do logic in almost every system: CSS is a programming language. Calling one ‘markup’ and the other…&nbsp;the <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/10/03/considering-css.html">only mainstream example of its rather peculiar family</a> doesn’t really help anyone understand anything.</p><h3 id="its-hard-to-find-simple-technology">It’s hard to find simple technology</h3><p>I think my biggest disappointment with Rust is that it isn’t simple. It can <em>create</em> simple programs: with the right compiler flags, it’ll produce very small executables with minimal fluff, but the language itself is dramatically complex. The compiler is huge and fiendish. Language features are numerous and subtle.</p><p>Other mainstream systems are complicated. <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> is an incredible engineering accomplishment and is really, really sophisticated. Practically every language and its implementation has grown significantly.</p><p>There are kind of few reasons to worry about this complexity in the 9-5, but in my free time it has me thinking about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, Forth, and Scheme - though even in the case of Scheme it’s hard to find an implementation that hasn’t grown a JIT or other fancy features.</p><p>On the Rust/Go-side of things, I’ve been paying a lot of attention to <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> - I think it’s pretty neat. It isn’t a ‘big idea’ language, just a really cleanly-designed C-like language that seems fix the main problems with C. And it’s really simple: the syntax is simple and it doesn’t have many big theories. It seems like it occupies a tiny portion of the current mindshare but for little CLI tools and systems software, could be really important.</p><p>After I started writing this, the ever-interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/everestpipkin">Everest Pipkin</a> published a <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list">list of tiny tools</a>, which is absolutely incredible - <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list#fantasy-consoles">fantasy consoles</a> is chock full of simple-at-their-core systems.</p><h3 id="helping-to-avert-the-apocalypse">Helping to avert the apocalypse</h3><p>In almost every way, the world is teetering on the brink. What can you do? It’s tempting to shut off the news and just get some work done when you can focus, and admittedly that’s what I’ve been doing most of the time. But there has to be something else.</p><p>In America, obviously part of this is <a href="https://joebiden.com/">voting for Joe Biden</a>. He’s the ‘anti-apocalypse’ candidate who couldn’t do worse than his predecessor even if he tried. He wasn’t my <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html">first pick</a>. But we aren’t choosing favorites anymore: we’re trying to avert the apocalypse, and there is no excuse to sit it out. If you don’t vote and the apocalypse happens, I’m blaming you.</p><p>Then there are other campaigns: donating to small, competitive candidates throughout the country. The smartest way to do this, I think, is by spreading donations between races that are picked by researchers. <a href="https://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a> has two such efforts: <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/great_slate">The Great Slate</a> (four rural house campaigns) and <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/state_slate_2">The State Slate</a> (eleven state house campaigns). He researches &amp; interviews candidates, configures an ActBlue page to split donations amongst them, and then you donate: it’s simple. <a href="https://blueprint.swingleft.org/">Blueprint</a> is doing something similar - splitting donations between ActBlue campaigns - but has visual polish like a fin-tech company and a more DC-insider staff. Both are ways of efficiently allocating donations to useful campaigns. They’re like value-factor index funds for political change.</p><p>When you allocate resources to useful campaigns, they are often Democrats running in conservative areas, so they’re often misaligned from you in one or more ways. It sucks that my donations go to folks with wishy-washy views on immigration policy or transit: but, again, we aren’t picking favorites anymore.</p><h2 id="nostalgia-bot">Nostalgia bot</h2><p>I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/everyblock">every lot dc</a> for a while and it’s the first time that a Twitter robot has really resonated. I lived in DC from 2009-2017 and seeing a familiar house or restaurant flash by in my Twitter feed made me feel nostalgic, thankful, or sad in turns. DC is a good place.</p><h2 id="content">Content</h2><p>To try and feel all right: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3QGSMKgY_Y">Beginner vs Professional Opera Singer</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urGD9nvBtw0">Jeano &amp; Jeannette</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB20T6nNP_c">1st Coffee Shop to mix Lean &amp; Xans</a>.</p><p>Relevant …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, July 27, a local news affiliate in Rochester, NY (home of Kodak HQ) tweeted that a "BIG announcement" was coming concerning a deal between Kodak and the federal government. This set off a week of unprecedented trading activity in the company's stock (KODK).</p><p>At around 12pm on Monday, the following was tweeted and deleted some time later:</p><p>"BIG announcement expected tomorrow from Kodak and the U.S. government regarding "a new manufacturing initiative." News 8 WROC Rochester will be all over it."</p><p><img src="https://www.chartfleau.com/kodak/twitter_leak.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In the next 30 minutes, about $800k was invested in the stock, which pushed the price up 14% from the morning's open. A Redditor picked up on the story later that afternoon, posting it to r/pennystocks and retweeting the details:</p><p><img src="https://www.chartfleau.com/kodak/twitter_retweet.jpg" alt=""></p><p>This also appears to have moved the stock, as we see another $500k invested in about 30 minutes after the post, and the price climbing to +22% on the day.</p><h2>Monday, July 27 - Leaks, Price and Notional Volume of KODK Stock</h2><p>Compared with the next couple days, Monday's activity is pretty much invisible. While the $4 million traded on Monday is a lot for KODK, the next day we see $2 billion flood into the company ahead of the official announcement at the end of day.</p><h2>$2 Billion Trades Before the Official Announcement</h2><p>Following the announcement that the government would provide Kodak with a $765M loan to manufacture drug ingredients, at Wednesday's open KODK was up almost 900% on the week.</p><p>Robinhood account data shows retail interest rising on Tuesday, although Robinhood accounts for a small portion of overall trading activity. About 20,000 Robinhood accounts added KODK on Tuesday, while the stock was traded 867,308 times according to market-wide data reported by IEX, with more than 10,000 trades per minute during peak activity. Big thanks to<!-- --> <a href="https://robintrack.net/">Robintrack</a> <!-- -->for sharing access to their data.</p><h2>KODK Price and Robinhood Account Holdings</h2><p>With a flood of buyers chasing the stock, and sell-side liquidity drying up, the price briefly climbed above $50 before pulling back. KODK shares ended the week at $21.85, which is near where it opened on Wednesday after the official announcement, but about ten times higher than Monday's open at $2.15.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Starting September 1st, I'm shutting down the user-facing portion of <a href="https://invidio.us/">https://invidio.us</a> and stepping away from development. If you have an account on the site, you can export your data <a href="https://invidio.us/data_control">here</a>, which will allow you to import everything to <a href="https://instances.invidio.us/">another instance</a> or self-host.</p>
<p>The API will continue to function until October 1st, to give time for any services relying on it to migrate to other solutions. If you're a patron on Liberapay, I would urge you to switch your donation to <a href="https://liberapay.org/iv-org">iv-org</a>, as that will ensure it goes to the stewards of the project going forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the time of this writing, the main Invidious instance has roughly 35,000 users. It's difficult for me to even begin to think of those as actual people, and not just a number. At that level, the amount of feedback I receive, which I would consider rather small in comparison to others I've seen, is overwhelming. It's demoralizing not being able to respond to all of it properly. Even more so when I've received something that deserves an involved response, but I haven't had the time to reply, which counter-intuitively means the best comments are least likely to receive any response. To echo <a href="http://antirez.com/news/129">antirez</a>: it's crushing not being able to be "there" for people.</p>
<p>Lately, I've felt myself withdraw much more in return. For any project though, especially something that requires maintanence, it's difficult to actually "unplug" and mentally recharge. Turning off notifications has helped, but it's definitely taken its toll.</p>
<p>For any project of a certain size, it's more important for the lead to be a manager more than a developer. As an example, it's mostly well-known that Linus Torvalds <a href="https://youtu.be/H8Gd9t7FQqI?t=525">hardly does any coding anymore</a>. At that point working on a side-project becomes a job, and not one I particularly enjoy. If I had known that I would've ended up in that position on a passion project, I'm curious if I would have made it open-source, or started working on it at all.</p>
<p>In either case, I consider myself extremely lucky to have people that can manage the project in future, and can only imagine what it would be like for someone without that luxury. I can't help shake the feeling that somewhere, the software I use is being developed solely by volunteers who would rather quit, but don't have the ability to say "no". This post has been delayed for that very reason, especially when so many people have given so much, and I feel they deserve a proper goodbye. At this point though, I can't find the strength to leave on better terms.</p>
<p>I don't want this to read like I somehow feel underappreciated or underpaid. I'm not motivated by praise or money. After working on the same thing for three years, I'm just tired and ready to move on.</p>

            <p>I bought a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS portable air conditioners in April 2020, since I expect to spend most of the Summer at home.  I'm not able to use window A/Cs here, though that would be the obvious choice for efficiency because all the hot parts remain outside.</p>
<h3>Similar models</h3>
<p>From looking at Internet photos, these A/Cs appear to follow the same general desgin:</p>
<ul>
<li>EdgeStar AP14001HS</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14S</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14SH</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-141BG</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-143MX</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't say to what extent they are identical, but the stuff on this page <em>might</em> apply to all of them.</p>
<h3>Air Gaps</h3>
<p>I wanted a dual-hose air conditioner because single-hose models are thermodynamically suboptimal.  Blowing hot air out the window creates negative pressure in the room, which sucks outdoor air back inside through various cracks.  In theory, dual-hose models avoid this problem by cooling the condenser with outdoor air, which is then re-exhausted.</p>
<p>However, when I feel the intake and exhaust hoses on the AP14001HS, the volume of air moving through the intake is considerably smaller, so air must be leaking from the room into the condenser compartment, and also between the room and outside while the blower is off.  There are two major locations where this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the bottom meets the front:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap.jpg" alt="bottom gap"></p>
<p>I sealed this one using tape:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap_taped.jpg" alt="bottom gap taped"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the back, below the air filter:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/filter_gap.gif" alt="filter gap"></p>
<p>To block this one, I cut a <strong>436mm x 98mm</strong> rectangle from a sheet of 1/16" (1.5mm) ABS plastic.  A cereal box also works for prototyping purposes... in general, the material needs to be pretty thin, but rigid enough to keep itself flat.</p>
<p>The plastic gets pulled toward the rear while the compressor is running, and toward the front otherwise, so a piece of tape can help hold it in place.</p>
<p>Finally, if you decide to open the unit (a 12-inch #2 Philips screwdriver is helpful), it's possible to tape over some internal hose/wiring gaps, but I'm not sure how important these are.</p>
<h3>Am I going to fry this thing?</h3>
<p>These modifications are intended to make the condenser compartment run hotter, which may shorten the life of some components, but I have no idea which ones or by how much.  I at least have a couple bits of evidence that this might not be a terrible idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>I asked EdgeStar support about sealing the bottom gap:</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>I recently purchased a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS dual-hose air
conditioners, and noticed that the intake hose moves quite a bit less
air than the exhaust hose. It seems that the extra air is "leaking"
into the condenser compartment where the bottom meets the front of the
unit. See the attached photo, where I temporarily covered the gap
with masking tape. Are you able to tell me whether this gap serves a
necessary function? Otherwise, I would rather leave it covered,
because I chose a dual-hose model to keep the inside/outside air
isolated from each other.</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting EdgeStar support.</p>
<p>The area that you've taped up is considered an overflow release.
You are perfectly welcome to keep that area taped up though as it
shouldn't cause an issue.  My engineers have informed me that it's
OK to do this.</p>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.  I had suspected that the gap was to prevent the unit from
filling with water, though it seems bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>The AP14001HS specs say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooling Capacity (ASHRAE) 14000 BTU</li>
<li>Cooling Capacity (SACC) 8600 BTU (38% lower)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to this article, "infiltration air" is a major factor in
the SACC measurement:
<a href="https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity">https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity</a>-</p>
<p>Have your engineers evaluated what effect sealing this gap (and other
intake leaks) has on cooling efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to get an answer for this from my engineers about the
effect on sealing the gap will have on efficiency.  They did say that
when the units are tested, they are tested with this gap to produce that
SACC rating.  There's no modifications to the units done while testing.
The efficiency of the units includes the air gap.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like there has been factory level testing with the gap
sealed, but the engineers who work on these units have performed their
own tests and found covering this gap to not be an issue.
They weren't able to give me additional information on the SACC though
as it's not something we can test at this location.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Someone on <a href="https://www.rollitup.org/t/modifying-portable-a-c-for-use-in-sealed-grow-room-w-co2-tutorial-w-pix.887831/">a plant-growing forum</a> reported sealing a Whynter ARC-143MX tightly enough to maintain a high-CO2 atmosphere.  It's not clear for what duration it actually ran, but the thread spans 4 years and the author doesn't mention a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wouldn't say that there's no risk of damage, but at least it's been tried before.</p>
<p>After sealing these gaps, I could feel more air moving through the intake port, and less air coming from the exhaust when I briefly obstruct the intake.</p>
<h3>Stand back, I'm going to try science</h3>
<p>In order to test these modifications, I installed the air conditioner in a somewhat-sealed closet with a 1.5m² volume.  I initialized the temperature to roughly 72°F, set the A/C to 61°F (the minimum value), and let it run for about 3 minutes until the blower shut off.</p>
<p>This was repeated 3 times in the factory configuration (red lines), 3 times with the gaps sealed (blue lines), and finally 2 times in "single hose mode" (black lines) with the intake sucking directly from the closet space.  I logged the temperature using a phone pointed at a thermometer, running Open Camera on 10-second repeat:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/ap14001hs_open_sealed_graph.png" alt="open/sealed graph"></p>
<p>I don't think my setup is rigorous enough to calculate any absolute efficiency numbers, but clearly the sealed configuration does a better job of cooling, and single-hose mode is abysmal.</p>
<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>I find it disgraceful that the portable A/C companies are so clueless about efficiency that improvements can be made using basic household supplies.  This reminds me of the computer PSU industry before 80 Plus, where everything is garbage and nobody knows what to buy.  Why is all the innovation focused on single-hose designs?</p>
<p>Places like the Bay Area are full of apartments and condos that are gradually becoming unlivable as temperatures rise, so it would be nice if people could just throw money at a decent product.</p>
<p>It's possible that <a href="http://www.climax-air.com/">http://www.climax-air.com/</a> knows what they're doing, since they make (as far as I know in 2020) the only dual-hose portable with a variable-speed compressor.  But I've only looked at the website, since their supply is very limited.  Maybe I'll check again when the EdgeStars wear out.</p>
<h3>Photos of the closet setup</h3>
<p>(The second AP14001HS visible in the mirror was used to set the room temperature.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet1.jpg" alt="closet experiment 1">
<img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet2.jpg" alt="closet experiment 2"></p>
<h3>Building-related Notes</h3>
<p>Each unit consumes about 10.5 amps, so it's important to map out which circuit breakers feed which outlets, and avoid sharing a circuit with a high-drain appliance like a microwave or electric kettle.  Ideally, they should also sit on opposite legs of the main breaker.  So far, I've had no issues sharing a 15 amp circuit with a refrigerator or computer.</p>
<p>On a day that peaks around 95°F, two A/Cs running continuously can keep 850 sqft in the mid-70s.  My IR thermometer says the ceiling is considerably warmer than the walls, so it would probably be useful to improve the attic insulation.</p>
<p>I plan to run these in "heat" mode during the winter, which should consume less energy than the resistive baseboard heaters, but time will tell how well that works.</p>
<p>One caveat to this installation is that my windows are locked/taped into position, so I can't open them at night when the air is cooler outside.  It would be nice to have an automatic "ventilate" mode for this purpose.  However, an A/C cooled with cool air produces even colder air, so it doesn't need to spend much time running in this state.</p>
<h3>Simpler Hacks</h3>
<p>This unit blows indoor air mostly upwards.  I opened the case to remove the built-in deflector, and put a Frost King HD9 in its place. This creates a roughly-horizontal air stream, and also seems slightly quieter without those extra fins in the way.</p>
<p>(In this photo, note that I taped over the LEDs to reduce brightness, and the chunk of foam was from an abandoned soundproofing experiment involving repositionable adhesive.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/deflector.jpg" alt="deflector"></p>
<p>The hoses may be insulated using a 6 inch "tubular cotton stockinette bandage".  After 5 minutes of runtime with 2 layers of cotton, I measured 122°F at the hose and 102°F at the cotton surface.  This isn't the greatest insulating material, but it's cheap, easy, and looks reasonable enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/stockinette.jpg" alt="stockinette"></p>
<p>You can rip open a standard furnace air filter, and cut the zig-zag part to fit the air intake's plastic frame.  Note that this will restrict airflow, so it probably makes sense to run the blower on high.  I increased the density a bit after taking this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/air_filter.jpg" alt="air filter"></p>
<h3>Soundproofing</h3>
<p>To make the unit run quieter, I started by wrapping it with a blanket, held in place using tape.  The hoses prevent anything from obstructing the room air intake.  Here is my "A/C burrito" prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/burrito_prototype.jpg" alt="burrito prototype"></p>
<p>With the unit running for hours when it's 90°F outside, the hottest point under the blanket is around 94°F, so it seems to do a reasonable job of keeping itself cool.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the improved version, I used mass loaded vinyl (MLV) wrapped in cotton blanket with velcro strips, held together using staples.</p>
<p>The cost of materials (for two copies) was roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>4ft x 12.5ft roll of 1 pound/sqft MLV: $110</li>
<li>Two twin-size (66 x 90 inch) cotton blankets: $50</li>
<li>A few yards of 2 inch velcro: $10</li>
<li>Staples with 9/16 inch legs (Bostitch BTHT73533): $4</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the dimensions I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png"><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png" alt="mlv_burrito dimensions"></a></p>
<p>I cut the MLV to size using a tape measure, square, pencil, and scissors.  Removing the bottom corners leaves room for the power cord.  The wings have different lengths because the power cord is off-center.</p>
<p>There are velcro strips along the top (with opposing velcro hot-glued to the A/C), and on the back so the burrito can attach to itself.</p>

<![CDATA[What Programmers Can Learn from Modular Synthesis and Unix]]>

<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

<p>There’s always been a considerable level of criticism against Java from a big sector of our industry; this criticism has been mostly focused on Java’s <strong>verbosity and the amount of boilerplate code it generates</strong> in many cases without need. Although I’ve always liked Java, I couldn’t say that these allegations are wrong; it’s indeed true that Java’s verbosity and its amount of clutter could become very annoying in multiple occasions. Although most of the times we have to accept that we don’t live in a perfect world and in most of the cases we have to accept the lesser of two evils. So yes, Java wasn’t perfect, we all know that, but the main question is why nothing was done before to address these concerns.</p>



<p>In my personal opinion, the only reason why changes took so long is because there wasn’t enough competition for Java, things were right as they were. <strong>Java language was dominating the market probably due to the lack of serious competitors</strong> and due to the big efforts made by Sun first and then Oracle afterwards.</p>



<p><strong>The strong type safety provided by Java and some of its characteristics as a well-structured language made it a very popular language for big projects</strong>; by using Java it’s generally more difficult to get things really out of hand. Also one of the main characteristics of Java, being a multi platform language which runs on its own virtual machine, made it a perfect match for many organisations. If you add its inherent capability of performing automatic performance optimisations through its famous JIT compiler, something that minimises in many cases the effects of badly-written code, then you have a pretty solid set of reasons to use Java.</p>



<p>But then what happened? What happened is that new languages able to run in the same JVM as Java were introduced into the market; languages that were eliminating some of the biggest annoyances in Java and offering a nicer environment to developers with quite a flat learning curve in some cases.</p>



<p>Before we continue let’s recapitulate and take a brief tour through the history of JVM languages!</p>



<h2>History of JVM languages</h2>



<p>Once thing I’d like to clarify before we start, is that I’ve skipped some of the existing JVM languages mainly because they never got enough traction to be considered candidates to be used widely in our industry. Having said that, let’s kick off our quick tour thorough JVM languages history!</p>







<p>To start with our tour we have to start with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> of course, the oldest and most popular language in the JVM world.<br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> was officially released in January 1996</strong>, so it’s been around for twenty-four years already; not bad, eh? Initially Java was a purely imperative language following a purely object-oriented programming style; also being a strongly typed language.  Java’s syntax is similar in some way to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a> languages, but it’s considered an improved version because it’s much easier to write code with Java than C or C++. On the other hand, we have that the biggest argument among its detractors is its verbosity.</p>



<p>The second JVM language that was released was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>; it started being around since 2003, although <strong>it’s first official and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process" target="_blank">standardised</a> version 1.0 didn’t come up until January 2007</strong>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> had the benefit of being able to be <strong>used as a scripting language as well</strong>. Groovy is a <strong>dynamically typed language</strong>, so type checks occur at runtime; this is one of the reasons why some developers don’t like Groovy. You write your code in Groovy, it looks correct on compilation time but then on runtime is when you realise that there’s something  wrong.</p>







<p>A very popular language for a few years came up next, we’re talking about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a>. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> was officially released in 2004</strong> and it brought <strong>a new programming model to the JVM world with functional programming</strong> and its declarative approach. We could affirm that Scala was the first to bring this concept of immutability that we’ve talked about before, so it has done very good things for the Java transformation. On the other hand, Scala detractors don’t like it due to its complex grammar and in general low readability.</p>







<p>The next language to make its appearance in the JVM world was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, a purely functional language that is becoming quite popular recently but it <strong>first appeared in 2007</strong>. Clojure is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">LISP</a> based language characterised by its simplicity and the use of pure functions. Among its drawbacks we could mention that it’s dynamically typed (same as Groovy) and the learning curve is much steeper, as its syntax is completely different from other JVM languages. There are a couple of good books that you should read if you’re interested in learning <strong><em>Clojure</em></strong>: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/hurUc7p" target="_blank">The joy of Clojure</a>” and “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/7azovHB" target="_blank">Programming Clojure: 3rd Edition</a>“.</p>







<p>And lastly but not least we have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>! <strong>Kotlin</strong> was first released in <strong>February 2016 </strong>and since then it hasn’t stopped growing in popularity. It was designed by the company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> with one clear goal: eliminate all the  most popular Java problems. In the way it’s been designed <strong>it has kept all the good things about Java </strong>but at the same time <strong>eliminating the majority of its problems</strong>; that’s why it’s becoming so popular and many consider that it could defeat Java in the next few years. If you want to know more about <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> (I encourage to do so, as it’s a great language), I’d recommend that you read the book <a href="https://geni.us/f4BI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Kotlin in Action”</a>, a fantastic book to start with <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> for Java developers.</p>

<p>So this are the most important JVM languages, we have skipped some others that are not so popular but we could mention some of them: <strong>Jython, JRuby, Ceylon, Fantom, et</strong>c. You can check the whole list of the existing JVM languages <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that we could notice is that <strong>Java didn’t have much competitors in the first eight or ten years</strong> but since then it started having some competition; so is having competition good or bad?</p>



<h2>Benefits of increased competition</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Java hadn’t changed too much in its early years probably because there was no need for it; the language was widely used and very popular despite of being far from perfect.</p>



<p>But then new competitors showed up, more modern languages that were bringing new features and solving some of the pain points that Java developers had been suffering for a long time.</p>



<p>For instance, let’s look at <strong><em>Scala</em></strong> language; Scala’s popularity was increasing since 2009, developers were welcoming this new functional style that allowed them more flexibility and also write parallel code safely and easily. We can see this trend in the following Google Trends graph:</p>

<p>What was Oracle’s reaction to this new trend? Java Lambdas and Streams were released in 2014. I think we can all agree that at that point was when Java made its biggest step to defeat Scala; everyone who currently works in the industry can feel that lose of steam that Scala has been suffering in the recent years.</p>



<p>One more benefit in having more competitors in the JVM world is the <strong>continuous improvements that JIT compiler and the JVM itself are experiencing.</strong> Now there are much more people interested in having an optimised JVM and improved performance optimisations. So competition has been a good thing for everyone!</p>



<p>The last competitor to appear in the arena has been <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has been very important because in some way it has shown Oracle the way to go forward. <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has shown that it’s possible to keep the good parts of Java but creating a more concise and fast to code language.</p>



<p>If we look at Google Trends to see how popular has Kotlin been in the last  few years this is what we have:</p>

<p>So it seems that Kotlin became quite popular fairly quickly but it seems to be settling down in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Oracle has taken good notes of the industry’s reactions with regards to Kotlin and if you take a look at the JDK 15 release notes, you can see that some of the Java new features are basically copies of what Kotlin had changed. For example, the <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359" target="_blank">new Java records</a></em></strong>, the new <strong><em>text blocks</em></strong> (multi-line string with triple quotes) or the new <strong><em>switch</em></strong> statement; which is more or less a copy of Kotlin <strong><em>when</em></strong> statement. You can take a look at JDK 15 release notes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>All of this we’ve talked about is what I call <strong>“The Kotlinisation of Java”</strong>; by becoming its stronger competitor in its history, Kotlin has shown Java the way to go. From my point of view Kotlin has been the only language I’ve seen that could overcome Java as a leader in our industry.</p>



<h2>The “Kotlinisation” of Java</h2>



<p>Some of the upcoming Java features are going to be a massive improvement for Java in terms of readability and in terms of improving one of the main weaknesses in Java, its verbosity. We could affirm that they all have <strong>a suspicious similarity with some Kotlin features</strong>.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that most of these features are <strong>feature previews</strong>, what means that if you install JDK 14 or JDK 15 when it gets released, <strong>you won’t be able to use them by default.</strong></p>



<p>Java feature previews are new features that are introduced in a release but are disabled by default; they’re <strong>included in the release just to gather feedback from the community of developers</strong>, so they’re <strong>still subject to changes</strong> and that’s why it’s not recommend to use them in production code.</p>



<p>To enable them at compilation time you’d have to do the following:</p>



<pre><code>javac --enable-preview --release 14</code></pre>



<p>If you want to enable them at runtime you’d have to run the following:</p>



<pre><code>java --enable-preview YourClass</code></pre>



<p>Of course, you can also enable them in your IDE, but <strong>be careful to not enable previews by default</strong> in all your new projects!</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at those changes that are going to have a bigger impact on our coding with future versions of Java!</p>



<h4>Java records</h4>



<p>Java records are a feature that many of us have been demanding for a long time; I guess you’ve been in the same situation multiple times, when you reluctantly have to implement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--" target="_blank">toStri…</a></p></div></div>

 <li>Part 3: Johannes Huebner on how he wants to democratise electric car conversions.</li></ol>

<h2 id="johannes-can-you-tell-us-a-little-how-you-got-started-with-electric-vehicles">Johannes, can you tell us a little how you got started with electric vehicles?</h2>

<p>It started in 2008. I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and electrical engineering. I always had a knack for this stuff, soldering, the hardware part and also some software. The initial motivation was that I was probably going to have to commute and just thinking that I would turn on my diesel car every day…It smells terrible in the morning when it is a cold start, it pollutes the city… it felt so wrong. This is what got me into electric traction.</p>

<p>I thought about a go-kart, but that didn’t seem like a good idea. Taking the bike was a lot more practical in the end, but it sparked the idea of EV conversions. The second motivation was purely technical, <strong>I found it intriguing that you can control these large powerful motors with a few lines of code and control very precisely what it can do</strong>… That’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I started with the controller code that was about forty lines of code. It was enough to spin the motor, of course, code started to grow as it got better. At the start I blew up some components, but amazingly little, thankfully after that not too much. From there on, I spent time after work and persisted on it over years. The first conversion rolled out in 2012/13, roughly 5 years after I started.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Proud-of-my-first-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="first transaxle"></p>

<h2 id="why-open-and-free-software-and-hardware">Why open and free software and hardware?</h2>

<p>I set up an electric car forum where I published the results of my experiments. At some point I was confident that what I built could be used by other people.</p>

<p>At the time. I was a Linux person and I liked the idea of open source, as opposed to Intellectual property. <strong>Hiding or being secretive, I never liked that. So, I decided to start something similar, but for automotive motor control</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time, AC motor control was considered something very complicated that only specialist companies would be able to manage. I wanted to show people that it is not that hard and I wanted people to be able to use these superior AC motors. The code was a great way to achieve that.</p>

<figure><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/the-very-first-prototype.jpg" width="400" alter="first prototype"> 
 <figcaption>First prototype.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="why-are-ac-motors-superior">Why are AC Motors superior?</h2>

<p>DC motors have large mechanical components. Many properties of the dynamics of the DC motor control are managed mechanically. They cannot be controlled by software precisely. It’s hard to transfer energy back into the battery with DC motors. They wear out because of the moving parts. But, AC motors don’t have these problems and they can be precisely controlled. And I mean, there’s no production costs.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-got-the-project-off-the-ground-what-happened-then">So you got the project off the ground, what happened then?</h2>

<p>I decided to go open source with both hardware and software. Around that time I came across an open source charger project. I learned a lot from that project, there were many things that I thought didn’t need to be there. It made me focus on how to improve my own designs. It also made me think that perhaps I needed to create a kit.</p>

<p>Soon after, I noticed what <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/06/a-community-that-converts-cars-to-electric-part-2-damien-maguire-interview.html">Damien</a> was doing. I was fascinated by the way he had been doing things and by his enthusiasm. I have to admit, I was very proud when he contacted me to get one of the my kits. He was one of the first people to inquire about it. He set it up online on his YouTube channel. I was very happy to be in contact with Damien. This is a relationship that’s been growing ever since. The designs are open source, so he took the design and adjusted it to use the Tesla motors. <strong>The rest is history. It’s a lot of back and forth between us. I took his ideas and put them back into my design and it’s just very much open source is supposed to work.</strong></p>

<figure><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/the-first-kit.jpg" width="400" alter="first kit"> 
 <figcaption>First kit.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="i-guess-that-is-how-open-inverter-came-about-then-or-is-it-a-collection-of-things">I guess that is how Open Inverter came about then, or is it a collection of things?</h2>

<p>It has become a collection. Initially, Open Inverter was just one inverter.</p>

<p>One of the main problems to bridge at the time was how to make your car road legal. If you pick some random motor and build your own inverter you can end up spending a lot of time and money testing to get the car approved and road legal.</p>

<p>The next development was that big car manufacturers like: Nissan, VolksWagen and Tesla started making electric cars, and those electric costs were crashing. <strong>With this, we have available high quality parts. Those parts are road legal qualified motors. This means that one of the main blockers for car conversions has been lifted! A massive win!</strong> With all the legal issues gone this is a big push for recycling and making conversions easier.</p>

<h2 id="these-oem-parts-are-from-hybrid-electric-only-or-both">These OEM parts are from hybrid, electric only, or both?</h2>

<p>It can be from any of them. We started with a few electric components. The first was an OEM drive chain of a Tesla.  Nowadays we are looking into hybrids more because it’s so much cheaper. If you go out and buy a Tesla part, it will set you back by about 5000 euros. If you go out and buy a somewhat equivalent hybrid drive, you can get it for about 200, 300 euros. Another large barrier to EV conversions removed.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-the-sense-that-youre-really-into-democratising-this-is-that-so">I get the sense that you’re really into democratising this. Is that so?</h2>

<p>Most definetly! I was inspired by the Steve Jobs biography and some articles where they describe how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wosniak</a> worked. For example when he got a $100 per part, he didn’t use all the budget on it. He shrunk the design to the very essence of what was necessary.</p>

<p>What I aim for is: <strong>not much there that doesn’t need to be there</strong>. I do not use expensive components because of fancy data sheets. Do not use many components that are supposedly superior. What’s the point in measuring the current with 0.1% accuracy If all you need is like 5% .</p>

<h2 id="so-that-gets-us-to-the-last-few-years-what-has-been-happening">So that gets us to the last few years, what has been happening?</h2>

<p>In 2016 I registered the domain for <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/07/openinverter.org">Open Inverter</a>. The idea was to create a platform for this ecosystem.  Not much happened for two years, but then a guy called Demare Deokman from Canada suggested we make a forum. We also added a Wiki and a shop. Before that people had to email me to request the different parts.</p>

<p>Then I started the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/openinverter">patreon page</a>, so that people could support my “artisanal engineering” work.  I hope it might become self-sustaining soon. If that happens I can spend all my time on this improving on the hardware and software.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-people-order-a-part-from-open-inverter">What happens when people order a part from Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>The process starts with getting the correct parts ordered, then I put it together, load the software to it, do some test procedures.I try to be as complete as possible, so people don’t have to go out and shop for something else when they get the kits. Follow the link for more info on the features of the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_features,8.html">Inverter Kit</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-blocker-for-more-car-conversions-to-electric">What is the blocker for more car conversions to electric?</h2>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--electric-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion electric transaxle"></p>

<p>The main blocker is education. If you start off knowing nothing it’s hard to collect information. We’re trying to solve that, but it’s a long road. It would be ideal to know, given a car you want to convert: What parts would be suitable? What work needs to be done, What mechanical adaptations?</p>

<p>Deleting misinformation would be good too. There are a lot of rumors out there that might keep people from even thinking about doing a car conversion. Some examples are around lithium batteries and how their usage erases the environmental benefits of an EV.  Another one is more practical, on how to make sure your car conversions are road legal without huge costs.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--fossil-removal.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion"></p>

<h2 id="since-you-are-enabling-car-conversions-do-you-have-it-in-your-plans-to-create-a-car-conversion-company">Since you are enabling car conversions, do you have it in your plans to create a car conversion company?</h2>

<p><strong>I wouldn’t. I see my work more like an ISO layer. It would be great if my work could enable others to run such a business.</strong> I think car conversions will eventually become more mainstream than they currently are. There are a lot of conversion shops in Germany but they have to charge ridiculous money to get the job done, it’s such custom work.</p>

<p>Every car is a new project. Standardising the conversions would make sense because it has certain advantages over buying a new electric car: the environmental impact is lower, parts already exist, also, you can customise certain aspects of the car to suit your needs better.  <strong>There are some very good chassis out there, that just have the wrong engine</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--body-work-with-Arber.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion body work with Arber"></p>

<h2 id="speaking-of-debunking-myths-is-it-expected-that-i-would-lose-the-back-seats-if-i-convert-a-car">Speaking of debunking myths, is it expected that I would lose the back seats if I convert a car?</h2>

<p>Maybe that would have been true with my first conversion many years ago, the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_electric-car-conversion,6.html">92 Polo</a>, the battery weighted 250 kilograms. However, with nowadays technology I could probably fit most of the batteries in front and wouldn’t lose them.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-interesting-integration-plans-for-open-inverter">Are there any interesting integration plans for Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>It is in the plans to have some sort of standard so that other systems, like Open Vehicles can use the information Open Inverter provides such as motor temperature, motor speed, etc. This is a significant amount of work but I think it would be very useful</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>A few years ago I splurged on an exercise bike. It’s a pretty expensive
item imho, both in upfront and ongoing subscription costs. But I was able
to justify it by riding it all the time so that per-ride it wasn’t that
expensive. I’m happy to say this was a huge boon for my fitness and it
was worth every penny.</p><p>The bike is the Flywheel Home Bike by Flywheel Sports. You open up the app,
pick a class, and start riding. The app shows you a live video stream of an
instructor, your position on the leaderboard so you can compete with the
other people in the class, and your realtime stats like power (watts) and
cadence (rpm). There’s all the usual motivational badges that come with
fitness apps these days, and each ride is logged so you can track your
progress over time.</p><p>Or, that’s how it used to work anyway.</p><p>Flywheel recently and abruptly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144268/flywheel-digital-classes-shut-down-peloton-exercise-trade-in">shut down</a> the Home Bike service following a legal battle with their competitor, Peloton. The bike does still work in that you can still pedal and adjust the resistance and technically get a workout. But the app is no longer so there are no classes, no competition, and no stats.</p><p>Flywheel customers left wanting a bit more had a few options:</p><ol><li>Swap it for a free refurbished Peloton. Join Peloton for the same monthly fee and take their classes instead. Not a bad deal and arguably an upgrade.</li><li>Use the free <a href="https://lifefitness.com/icg-digital-experience/training-app">LifeFitness ICG Training App</a>. The Flywheel Home Bike is a rebranded LifeFitness IC5 so it just happens to work with this app. This gives you live stats like power and cadence and the ability to track your progress but doesn’t provide any live classes or competition, nor is it officially supported.</li><li>Add a set of power meter pedals ($). Use the bike with the massively-multiplayer online cycling simulator <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> and other training apps.</li><li>Reverse engineer the bike. Set its data free to be used with Zwift and other training apps. No power meter pedals required.</li></ol><p>The rest of the post is a walk-through of my experience writing some code that enables the Flywheel Home Bike to work with Zwift and other training apps. It likely also works for the LifeFitness IC5 and support for other bikes should be easy to add.</p><p>The finished program is called <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">Gymnasticon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">the code</a> is open-source on GitHub.</p><h3 id="project-goals">Project goals</h3><p>The primary goal is to make the Flywheel Home Bike work with Zwift. It would be great if it also works with other cycling apps like TrainerRoad and Rouvy.</p><p>The solution should be easy to use for a non-developer and non-destructive to the bike.</p><p>The plan to get there is broken down into 3 parts:</p><ol><li>Write some code to get power and cadence data out of the bike’s proprietary protocol</li><li>Write some code to send power and cadence data to Zwift emulating a Bluetooth bike</li><li>Put the two together into a final working solution</li></ol><h3 id="part-1---getting-data-out-of-the-bike">Part 1 - Getting data out of the bike</h3><p>Only two pieces of information are needed to make a bike work with Zwift: power (watts) and cadence (rpm). Power enables Zwift to calculate your speed and position in the game. Cadence improves the experience of cadence-based workouts and enables Zwift to accurately animate your character.</p><p>We know from experience that this bike is capable of producing that information and that it communicates with the official Flywheel app using Bluetooth so the first step
is to open up a Bluetooth service explorer and see what’s available.</p><figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/videos/clip4_bluetility.mp4" alt="Bluetility on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike." width="100%"></video><figcaption><p><a href="https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility">Bluetility</a> on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The bike advertises a single service with two characteristics (aka data values). A web
search for the service UUID tells us this is <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/include/bluetooth/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> which
is a custom service defined by Nordic Semiconductor. It allows sending
arbitrary data back and forth, emulating a serial port.</p><p>The characteristics are named from the bike’s perspective. To transmit
data to the bike we write to the receive (RX) characteristic. To receive data
from the bike we subscribe to the transmit (TX) characteristic.</p><p>Clicking subscribe on the (TX) characteristic shows that the bike is already sending some data. It is a bit hard to see the data here though. The short JavaScript program below uses the <a href="https://github.com/abandonware/noble">noble</a> Bluetooth client library to connect to the bike and dump all the received data to the console so we can begin to analyze it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>/**

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function A is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.
</p>

<p>When we have this representation, we can then rethink <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_1| &gt; |\lambda_2|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

        <p><span>I</span>n their long-running effort to defeat cancer, medical researchers have made a startling discovery: A lot of the time, they have no idea how their anti-cancer drugs work. And, strange as it may sound, that is actually great news for future&nbsp;therapies.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re not saying these drugs arenâ€™t good,â€� explains Ann Lin, a geneticist at Stanford University. They really do kill cancerous cells, often quite well; they just donâ€™t do the job the way that their developers believed, she finds. Her work highlights how much of anticancer drug discovery is still based on trial-and-error searches. Itâ€™s as if your auto mechanic learned to fix your car by kicking the fenders and smacking the hood until it started. That technique might get the job done, but there would be no way to improve it or to figure out what went wrong if it failed the next time. Similarly, oncologists have often been forced to rely on drugs without a clear understanding of their mechanism of action, Lin notes; in essence, they were kicking and smacking the tumors at a molecular level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning what they <em>donâ€™t</em> know about those drugs is a critically important step forward. It is allowing Lin and her colleagues to zero in on the actual, specific molecular mechanisms that really do kill cancerous cells. Now that those mechanisms are being identified, drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for other treatments that attack cancer the same way.</p>
<p>Better yet, thatâ€™s still only half of the story. While Lin is identifying molecular mechanisms that could lead to new anticancer drugs, Todd Golub is working the problem from the other end—identifying anticancer drugs that could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms.</p>
<blockquote>Drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for new treatments.</blockquote>
<p>Golub, the chief scientific officer and director of the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, realized that trial-and-error searches could actually be extremely useful if there were a way to make them fast and efficient. Extending the metaphor: If you could rapidly try a million different combinations of hood-smacking and fender-kicking,&nbsp;you would undoubtedly&nbsp;uncover surprising new ways to fix your car. The Golub Lab has&nbsp;developed a technique just like that for cancer treatments:&nbsp;a high-speed drug-screening process called <a href="https://www.theprismlab.org/" target="_blank">PRISM</a> (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures), which has already proven spectacularly successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golub sees Linâ€™s targeted studies and his own, broad-based drug searches coming together in an open-source database of cancer-fighting tools called the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/" target="_blank">Cancer Dependency Map</a>. He and his colleagues describe that map as â€œthe preclinical foundation for cancer precision medicineâ€�—a future in which researchers not only know exactly how their drugs work, but also how to tailor them best to the needs of each individual patient.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hese advances come at a critical time. The National Institutes of Health projects that more&nbsp;than 600,000 people will&nbsp;die of cancer this year in the United States, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. Progress in cancer treatment has been slow: â€œNinety-seven percent of cancer drugs are predicted to fail clinical trials, more than in any other field,â€� Lin says. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted short-term research away from cancer, even as the coronavirus poses a heightened risk to patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>When Lin started out, she had no inkling she would be taking on such huge challenges. In 2017, while she was a researcher in the lab of <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/jason-sheltzer/" target="_blank">Jason Sheltzer</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she&nbsp;was conducting a seemingly routine analysis of the way that cancer cells use an enzyme called MELK. Numerous studies had determined the cancer cells canâ€™t live without that enzyme, so it seemed like a promising point of vulnerability. Several MELK-blocking compounds were already undergoing clinical trials as potential anti-cancer drugs.
</p>
<p>Lin was merely trying to learn a little more about why MELK was so essential. â€œThat's when we got the big surprise,â€� she says.</p>
<p>Using a set of gene-editing molecules known as CRISPR/Cas 9, Lin and her collaborators engineered a batch of cancer cells that couldnâ€™t produce any MELK. Instead of dying, though, the cells carried on just fine. Puzzled, she ran the experiment a second time; again, the cells lived. The team then conducted similar experiments on five other supposed cancer targets, all of which also had at least one associated anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. In each case, the cancer cells didnâ€™t care about the specific genes allegedly being targeted by the drugs. Yet, somehow, those drugs&nbsp;were killing cancer cells anyway.

<p>CRISPR enabled Lin and her team to examine one of the anti-MELK drugs in detail,&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24179" target="_blank">solve the mystery</a>. They determined that the drug attacks cancer cells through a completely different mechanism than the one its developers thought they were going after: It shuts down an enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase 11, or&nbsp;CDK11, which regulates cancer growth. Researchers had previously attempted to develop drugs that blocked CDK11, but without success—or so they thought. It turns out they had hit their target without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Armed with this deeper insight, oncologists can begin developing more accurate anti-cancer treatments. Even so, bringing those drugs to market will remain&nbsp;a complicated and time-consuming process. Thatâ€™s where Golub comes in.</p>
<p><span>I</span>nstead of looking for drugs that kill cancer, studying how they work, and finally testing if theyâ€™re safe, Golubâ€™s group started with a pool of medical compounds that had already been cleared for human use. They went prospecting in the Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub, an enormous collection of unused pharmaceuticals that passed safety tests but didnâ€™t perform well in late-stage clinical trials. Most of the drugs were developed for other diseases, but Golub suspected that some of them serendipitously would prove effective against cancer.</p>
<p>To find out, he pitted 4,518 different drugs against 578 cancer cell lines taken from 24 different types of tumors. It sounds like an insane process of trial-and-error, and just a few years ago it would have been. The PRISM technique is what makes it practical: By attaching a genetic â€œbarcodeâ€� to each cell line, the researchers were able to test multiple lines at the same time and to automate the whole, data-intensive process.</p>
<p>In the end, Golub team was amazed to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-019-0018-6" target="_blank">discover</a> that nearly 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities. Since they had already passed safety trials, these compounds could now speed through the testing process. Even more exciting, some of the drugs flagged in this experiment seem to attack cancers in ways not seen in the lab before. These novel cancer-fighters are prime candidates for the kind of CRISPR analysis that Lin performs, potentially revealing undiscovered molecular techniques for fighting cancer.</p>
<blockquote>Almost 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities.</blockquote>
<p>That merger of trial-and-error discovery and targeted analysis is already beginning at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Sara Althubaiti, a bioinformatics expert at the university, has created artificial-intelligence software that sifts through huge databases describing the genetics of cancer. The AI ferrets out previously undiscovered relationships between DNA mutations and cancer behavior. It has already identified dozens of potential anti-cancer target genes—the kind of information needed to fill in Golubâ€™s Cancer Dependency Map.</p>
<p>Lin is heartened to see her early, seemingly botched experiments contributing to this new assault on cancer. With CRISPR precision and PRISM breadth working together, she says, â€œwe might be able to create a more rigorous preclinical pipeline.â€� No fender-kicking required.

<p>I’ve been working remotely at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> for 6 years now. As a software engineer, one of the critical skill I believe we <del>should</del> <strong>must</strong> have is being able to learn continuously. However, working in a fully distributed team, <a href="https://timezone.io/team/buffer">split accross 10+ timezones</a>. I live in Asia (UTC +8) while most of my teammates live in the US or Europe. That’s up to 15 hours difference. We only meet each other <a href="https://joel.is/the-power-of-company-retreats/">once a year</a>. This remote setup affects how we learn from my team, compared to if I were in a physical office.</p>
<p>With the current COVID-19 crisis, when company suddenly switched to a work from home setup, understanding how the dynamic of knowledge sharing in your team is important. You don’t want the knowledge shared being stopped. I’ll lay down some of our successful experiments, their pros and cons, what I think works for me and our company.</p>
<h2 id="-the-real-miss-opportunity-in-a-remote-team-knowledge-sharing">❌🧠 The real miss opportunity in a remote team, knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>In a remote team, we don’t have regular random opportunities to come together like we would in a physical office. Conversations will be focused within your current team conversation channel. You won’t be able talk over the watercooler/coffee machine about your current issues with someone else than your core team. You’ll miss opportunities to talk with other teams about their challenges, bring up your expertise, and learn from someone else experiences/advices from an other team. We stop learning as much as we could because we’re not seing each other anymore.</p>
<p>As a remote company, how can you overcome this challenge? How do you optimize knowledge sharing, no matter which timezone?
This is where the concept of regular snackchats at Buffer was born 3 years ago, introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-snackchats">🍴💬 Snackchats</h2>
<p>Snackchats are small talks that everyone can propose in the company. It can be any topics, from code, architecture, management, tips for a tool to side projects.  Anything really. We usually ask on slack, and if you  there is enough interest, you commit to it and prepare it.
Here an example of <a href="https://tik.dev/">Tigran</a> asking interest on using Datadog Logs with APM together:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/snackchat-tigran-asks.png" alt="Snackchat Tigran asks interest"></p>
<p>Here a great example of snackchat by <a href="https://hami.sh/">Hamish</a> on an “Intro to GitHub Actions”:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9sdqTc5_qg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Also here some other great ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/federicoweber">Federico</a> on <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2018/06/08/snackchat-may-31-product-oriented-git-workflow/">git workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joebirch.co/">Joe</a> on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7OCVQD97WE">Get started with Go</a>”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-for-doing-a-snackchat">Tips for doing a snackchat</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep them short: 10 to 20 minutes, keep interest of your audience</li>
<li>Record them, people will be able to see them later if they can’t attend</li>
<li>Your busy teammates will be able to see them at x2 speed</li>
<li>Have a directory (notion/wiki) for future reference</li>
<li>Like video call, putting a face, it’s great to have a human touch to something “technical” to see someones smilling, worrying.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-downsides-of-a-snackchat">The downsides of a Snackchat</h4>
<p>The downside of snackchat is that takes quite a bit of energy to prepare. There can also be intimidating to ask if a topic you might want to present won’t get enough interest from your workmates.
In a remote setting, people will try to make the best use of their time, and we might most of the time be busy on prioritties. The time you will set might not be the best fit for everyone. I wasn’t able to participate to most of the snackchats because I live in a total different timezone than most of the people in the company. The tip here is to <strong>make sure to record your snackchat</strong> and repost it for people who couldn’t attend them.</p>
<h2 id="-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">⚡️ Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts</h2>
<p>An other format I personally enjoy doing is the “spontaneous” knowlege sharing with a screencast . I’m in the infrastructure team, where product engineers might not necessarly need to understand what happens “behind the scene”, but where the knowledge could be useful to understand more how service bahave, or simply can pick their curiosity for learning purpose.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy the screencast format for few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snackchats requires preparations, and I know I will not be great at “live” presentations</li>
<li>Being in a timezone where you wake up when others start going to sleep isn’t great for coordinating any live presentation.</li>
<li>I’m more in the introvert side.  It require quite a bit of energy to ask interests, worrying if people shows up. Sharing when I feel like it is easier mentally.</li>
<li>My envy to create educative content isn’t always consistent. There is some days where I will be more encline to share it and some where I’ll not feel like it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-on-making-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">Tips on making “Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts”</h4>
<ul>
<li>I like using <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a>. They make recording your screen and voice really easy. It also allows you to pause the recording, and aslso has an impressive online editor to trim your blanks.</li>
<li>Try to keep the video dynamic, go to the point, and avoid the fluff, but keep the jokes</li>
<li>Keep it short, ideally under 10 minutes</li>
<li>When I know a video will be valuable on the long term, I try to do some Google slide to structure the video</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example where I wanted to show (not the first time) the benefits of using one of our internal librarie to make debuguing faster and easier:</p>


<p>1 picture is worth a thousand words, but 1 GIF worth a lot more. It can save you or your teammates a lot of time, save you some context switching, and save your productivity. When someone has a question, or you want to explain something complicated, a simple GIF of the solution will be more than enough than trying to make on a call and explain it.</p>
<p>I enjoy using <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">cloudapp</a>. For example here what I’ll share when I wanted to share the results after migrating a service from PHP to Golang:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/go-vs-php-cpu.gif" alt="PHP vs Golang CPU usage"></p>
<h2 id="-make-sharing-knowledge-explicitely-valuable">🥇 Make sharing knowledge explicitely valuable</h2>
<p>At Buffer, we have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_QkZISJ2cIk_Py_pdzsAt5fUwWOYZVkkXg4KZM8IXA/htmlview">engineerig framework</a> that encourage kowledge sharing. To reach a “Senior Engineer 2”, One of the criteria would be… “educates across domain” or “Reach out to other teams within and beyond Buffer to share knowledge”. I don’t mean that money should be the incentive, but , I’ve personally because it was one of the condition to reach the next step, but then started to enjoy it more and more. I’m now doing it because I see value in it now whe other teamate tells me how valuable are my videos.</p>
<p>An other great way to encourange to continue sharing is to reach people who share that their knowledge were helpful. Here for example <a href="https://josemdev.com/">Jose</a> telling me he is using my video for a future mongoDB upgrade:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/jose-watch-eric-loom.jpg" alt="MongDB upgrade Jose watch"></p>
<h2 id="-be-a-teacher-dont-make-asssumptions-over-communicate">👨‍🏫 Be a teacher, don’t make asssumptions, over communicate</h2>
<p>In a remote team, informations get easily lost. Other team members might not have the same context as you, new hires are recurrent occurence, and won’t dare to ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question">“stupid questions”</a>.</p>
<p>Extra communication is key, don’t make assumption, the more you say, the better teamates will get more knowledge. I’ve even more for trivial questions, where some fundamental might be missing and where your informations will be be really valuable</p>
<p>One of the favorite people I’ve been working at Buffer is certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/colinscape">Colin</a>. Since day 1 I’ve joined the company, he’s been relentlessy explaining and giving context if any issues or questions arises. He’s been certainly the go to person when engineers has doubts or need advices. Indirectly, it help to make you look “approachable” for new members, especially in a remote settings where you won’t have much chance to interract.  Sharing knowledge is definitely a great mark of leadership.</p>
<p>Additioanlly, It will help creating a great culture in your company where there no stupid question exists, and where your team will feel safe.</p>

<p>Sharing links via Slack or email are great, but those content get easily lost. You shouldn’t make assumptions your teammates saw the video or message you’ve shared the other week. I recommend to maintain a directory (in Notion/Paper/Wiki etc…). When you see a question that was answered in one of your video, share it again. A natural snowball effect will happen when your teammates will see more and more people sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>Keep sharing ❤️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland</strong></p><p>Dictators around the world muzzle debate. Autocratic governments label dissent as treasonous.&nbsp;The voice of the people is rarely heard.</p><p>The hallmark of a liberal democracy, by contrast, is that the people are allowed to assert their views and preferences even if the government, or the majority of their compatriots, don’t like it. They get to protest, to criticize, even to scream or holler or swear—and, on occasion, to listen and change their minds. But this dialogue, which is so central to our system of government, requires two essential ingredients: a willingness to put up with disagreeable views on the part of some and the confidence to express their opinions without fear of retribution on the part of others.</p><p>The most obvious threat to freedom of speech comes from the state: Citizens will only feel safe to criticize their president, for example, if they enjoy protections for their free speech and know that judges won’t do the bidding of the government. But as social scientists and political philosophers have long recognized, social pressures can be just as effective in making citizens afraid of expressing unpopular opinions: The more they fear getting fired from their job or publicly being branded as a “thought criminal,” the more likely they are to self-censor.</p><p>This is why it is so important to measure how free the citizen of democratic countries actually feel to express their views. Is it true, <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">as some have argued</a>, that the current cultural climate has made Americans more reluctant to speak their mind than in the past? Or do we live in a golden age for rollicking debate in which, <a href="https://theobjective.substack.com/p/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice">as others have responded</a>, a far greater number of people feel empowered to join the conversation?</p><p>In the 1950s, many social scientists worried that efforts by Joe McCarthy and his allies to root out left-wingers were creating a “silent generation” of Americans who were afraid to share their political opinions in public. To test whether or not this was really the case, Samuel Stouffer, a Professor of Sociology at Harvard, decided to conduct an innovative public opinion survey. “Do you or don't you feel as free to speak your mind as you used to?” he asked a representative sample of Americans.</p><p>Back in 1954, the answer Stouffer got was surprisingly reassuring. Only about one in eight Americans at that time felt scared to speak their minds. As McCarthy’s influence on the country waned, there was little evidence that he had managed to manufacture a voiceless generation.</p><p>But since the 1950s, answers to that same question have become a lot more worrying. The last time the question was asked, the percentage of Americans who fear speaking their mind had grown by threefold. At its high point in 2015, nearly half of all Americans reported that they do not feel free to express their opinions. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:286988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This trend is worrisome on its face. In comparison to the McCarthy era, it is ghastly. The answer to the question that is now so widely debated seems unambiguous: Americans are much more likely to self-censor today than in the past. </p><p>Perhaps, as some argue, we should not be too worried if some Americans feel the need to self-censor. If those who hold views that are racist or “deplorable” are feeling less free to hold forth than in the past, the country might become a more welcoming place for ethnic, religious, sexual, and other minorities. </p><p>But before we discount the large percentage of Americans who don’t feel free to speak their minds—or, worse, assume that they must feel uncomfortable to do so because they hold deeply despicable views—it is worth finding out who they actually are.</p><p>Three of the clearest findings from our research are negative in nature. First, one might suspect that many people are afraid to speak out because they fear the coercive force of the government. But the data suggest that this is not the case. Among those who believe that the government might prohibit certain political activities, such as organizing protest marches and demonstrations, 40 percent engaged in self-censorship. Among those who believe that it would not, 41 percent did. </p><p>Second, there is no clear partisan pattern. The percentage of Democrats who are worried about speaking their mind is just about identical to the percentage of Republicans who self-censor: 39 and 40 percent, respectively. </p><p>Finally, there is no clear relationship between the intensity of people’s views and their tendency to self-censor. Not only are those with right-wing views as likely to self-censor as those with left-wing views; moderates are just as likely to self-censor as those who fall on either end of the ideological spectrum. </p><p>So what <em>does</em> predict who is reluctant to speak up? The answer is that Americans are more likely to self-censor the more urban and educated they are. In a surprising reversal of the usual trends of political participation, in which citizens who have more resources feel more empowered to take an active role in civic life, it is the urbanites and the highly educated who are most afraid to speak their mind.</p><p>Consider education. Those who are more highly educated are far more likely to censor their views than their less educated brethren. Among Americans without a high school diploma, for example, 27 percent self-censor. Among Americans who completed high school, this goes up to 34 percent. And among those who have attended college for at least a few years, 45 percent do. This suggests that Americans are socialized into learning to keep their mouth shut: the longer you spend in the educational system, the more you learn that it is appropriate to express some views, but not others.</p><p>This helps to explain the nature of contemporary censorship culture. We might imagine that Americans engage in self-censorship if they lack the educational resources to know how they are supposed to talk about certain issues. But the evidence suggests that those Americans who have little education and live in the hinterland actually feel most free to speak their minds. Perhaps they have simply never been taught that it is wise to keep their mouths shut. </p><p>Far from becoming more comfortable with how to express their views as they become more educated, Americans who go to college appear to learn that they should shut up if they disagree with their peers. As a result, it is not those who feel that they have little to say about politics who have learned to hide their “aberrant” views; rather, it is those who live in the most urban and educated parts of the country.</p><p>Decades ago, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann wrote about what she called the “Spiral of Silence.” If they dare to speak up, those holding minority viewpoints get rebuffed. To avoid repeating the same unpleasant experience, they demur when the next opportunity to state their opinions presents itself. Pretty soon, a view held by, say, a quarter of the people in a particular group can, in this way, stop being expressed—or heard—at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The spiral of silence need not be instigated by an oppressive government determined to quash dissent. Rather, it can arise spontaneously when the social norms governing interpersonal interactions provide insufficient support for those who are in the minority—either in the country as a whole, or in some local context—to feel comfortable expressing their views. </p><p>That is why high levels of self-censorship should be treated as an ominous warning sign. They signal the development of a culture of orthodoxy that is animated by a false sense of certainty about what is true and what is false—and a proud intolerance of those who might dare to voice an opinion that conflicts with the mainstream. </p><p>The sobering results of our survey suggest that this accurately describes today’s United States.</p><p><strong>James L.

I came across Derek’s book<strong> </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2D8GzCL"><strong><em>Anything You Want</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a few years ago when I was reaching burn out amounts of stress from juggling being a full time teacher in a tough school district, running a coaching business and also trying to be a good husband in a new marriage.&nbsp; </p><p>My goal is to pack as much Sivers wisdom into one spot so you won’t have to go crawling through the internet for it.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p><h4>#1 The Pursuit of Enough&nbsp; </h4><p>It is the inability to define what “enough” is that is society’s greatest cause of unhappiness. We walk around with ideas of success <em>thinking</em> that certain things will bring us lasting joy. Usually what we think we want isn’t even <em>our own idea</em>&nbsp;but was rather planted there by someone or something else.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire’s extravagant estate. Kurt said, “Wow! Look at this place! This guy has everything!” Joseph said, “Yes, but I have something he’ll never have…Enough." </p></blockquote><p>Just think about it: How many times have you seen some ad for a 17 year old kid telling you the single <em>secret</em>&nbsp;to building wealth from his mom’s basement? How many times have you seen some weird guy in front of a rented leer jet on a YouTube pre-roll ad trying to convince you to invest in Bitcoin? How many times have you seen a sports car and sighed wondering when you will get your big break…?&nbsp; </p><p>As Derek’s success grew monetarily in CD Baby his happiness inversely went down. Is that the case for everyone? No. But, it was the case for Derek and that’s an important lesson to understand.&nbsp; </p><p>The single most important lesson I learned from Derek was to ask myself “Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or am I doing this to impress an invisible jury that exists only in my head?”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596312178192_16609"><p><h4>#2 No Roads, Only Directions </h4></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596280983756_10748"><div><p>When I was being evacuated by the U.S. State Department from Ukraine in 2014 as Russia invaded, I was told probably one of the single most impactful things by my Ukrainian taxi driver to the airport. </p><p>Ukraine spends more money than any other country in Europe on roadwork but still has some of the worst roads (corruption) so as we tried to avoid the pot hole my driver joked: <em>In Ukraine, there are no roads, only directions</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>This is kinda like business: You might think you have all these wonderful schemes, plans and tricks up your sleeve to scale, make money and create incredible products for your clients only to have them quickly blow up in your face. Instead of scheming Derek suggests you simply “answer the cries for help” instead.&nbsp; </p><h4>#3 Hell Yeah! Or Hell No!&nbsp; </h4><p>Deciding what to do in life should meet one metric: If you aren’t saying “Hell Yeah!” It is an automatic “Hell No!”  </p><p>As a peoplepleaser by nature I’ve ignored this advice only to end up hurting relationships, business deals or customer trust in the long run. It comes down to FOMO. We don’t want to miss out on living a larger life so we collect lukewarm commitments that clog up our day too much to make space for rare “Hell Yeah!” opportunities that may pop up.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“If you’re not saying “<em>Hell yeah!”</em> About something, say no. When deciding whether to do something if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” Then say no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “<em>Hell yeah!</em>”&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>It seems that in some cases, you may need to say Yes to things that don’t make you say “Hell Yes” to at least break into a particular sphere or develop relationships. </p><p>The latte boy in the DC lobbyist office doesn’t necessarily want to be everyone’s errand boy, but he knows that a year well spent networking will set him up for what he really wants to do in the long run: deal making. The unpaid graduate assistant coach sleeping on the couch in the locker room of an SEC football program probably has a girlfriend wondering what the heck he is doing, but he knows he is there for the network first.&nbsp; </p><p>Again, the root of this idea is defining enough - defining the limits of what makes you energized and what drains you.&nbsp; </p><h4>#4 Execution, Execution, Execution </h4><p>Steve Jobs wasn’t the first person to try making a smartphone. Uber wasn’t the first ride sharing app idea. Tesla wasn’t the first electric car idea (in fact electric car plans have been around as long as the Model T Ford). It was their execution on these ideas that turned these good ideas into good businesses.&nbsp; </p><p>Good ideas aren’t automatically good businesses.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>…ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions…To make a business, you need to multiply the two components. </p></blockquote><p>I have been such a reflector in my own life - filling up tombs of journals and notebooks with ideas, theories and notes but it dawned on me looking at all these notebooks: <em>Where was the execution?</em> &nbsp;What if instead of sitting on 1.5hr’s of reading and notes per day I decided to ship, publish and take action instead? I think some reflection is healthy. But I’ve often used idea formation as a crutch to excuse my own inaction. </p><h4>#5 The Market Wants What <em>It</em> &nbsp;Wants </h4><p>It’s important to tinker early and often because you won’t know what people like until you put something in front of them to accept or reject. In <a href="https://brendancahill.io/brensblog/seth">Seth Godin’s marketing work </a>and in my own experience it is abundantly clear that people aren’t always rational. Even if they <em>say</em>&nbsp;they would pay x amount for your product or idea you just won’t know if that’s true until they do.&nbsp; </p><p>So, until your market buys it hasn’t bought. </p><p>Until your course receives sign ups the market doesn’t want it. Until your consulting service is used the market doesn’t want it. This is why it's important to iterate nimbly. Don’t sink all you money into developing a product that people <em>only say</em>&nbsp;is a good idea.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It’s only a good idea if they buy.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Derek talks about how <em>what he thought</em>&nbsp;CDBaby did was <em>very</em>&nbsp;different from what his paying customers thought it did. He thought “it was just a credit card processing service” but it turned out his clients saw CDBaby as a democratized online CD storefront.&nbsp; </p><p>In my own coaching business I <em>thought</em>&nbsp;was just coaching high school kids how to kick better, but overwhelmingly the parents and players I worked with saw my business as helping them navigate the weird world of college football recruiting.&nbsp; </p><p>What you think your business does isn’t usually what your customers think it does. Why your customers come to you usually isn’t why you think they come to you. Be ready to pivot.&nbsp; </p><h4>#6 The Best Way To Grow Isn’t To Grow.&nbsp; </h4><p>You’ve earned a certain level of trust with your current customers. They love you. They think whatever you’re doing is better than sliced bread. You are giving them oxygen as they gasp for air. You are making them happy. You are helping them live a fuller life. Yet, what do most businesses try to do the second they taste moderate success? Grow.&nbsp; </p><p>Growth isn’t bad, but how it is done is often a problem. They seek to find new clients. Maybe higher paying ones. Maybe ones in different areas. Maybe to break into a <em>new</em>&nbsp;market. But more revenue usually just means more liability, more expenses and less of <em>you</em>&nbsp;to go around to your true fans who love you.&nbsp; </p><p>Of course, this selfish pursuit of growth is justified as selflessness by believing that as a bigger business you can somehow now better meet the needs and wants of your <em>current</em>&nbsp;clients. But really, growth is going to take your focus further away from them.&nbsp; </p><p>If you really want to grow, focus solely on your preexisting clients. </p><blockquote><p>None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.</p></blockquote><p>The more my own businesses have grown and the more the businesses of my friends have grown the more headaches they’ve experienced.&nbsp; </p><p>Instead of trying to grow your business in volume or quantity grow it qualitatively.&nbsp; </p><p>Your current clients are going to be your best source of newer clients anyway.&nbsp; </p><h4>#7 Exclude! </h4><p>You can’t be all things to everyone. Yet, many business owners do exactly that. When you are trying to gain traction you market to everyone, take every call, take every appointment, and will be overeager to close new sales. The problem is no one wants to be at a club that lets <em>just anyone</em>&nbsp;in - not even you.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Being exclusive is a long term game you want to play with long term true fan customers. It will feel in the moment like you are saying no to more money, which you technically are, but in the long term you are actually saving yourself more in money and customer happiness.&nbsp; </p><p>Let’s say you let one lousy customer in who you know isn’t a good fit but, since they are willing to pay you a lot you say yes anyway. This customer then calls you day and night, berates your sales staff and sucks the air out of your limited time and attention for the customers you actually <em>do</em>&nbsp;enjoy working with. In fact, you’ve become so distracted that a few of your true fan clients have drifted away to other competitors now. Now this lousy customer has cost you money instead of making you any.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s a fine line between being polarizing enough to rally your 1% troops and appearing crazy or arrogant. It’s only really up to the business owner to know the difference. But, everyone likes to have their own private club. You can give that to them.&nbsp; </p><h4>#8 There’s No Right Way (Which Might Be Wrong)</h4><p>I used to think my heroes playing in the NFL growing up were super men, different, or unique, but through my business I’ve met and made friends with quite a few of them. They’re just like …</p></div></div></div>

		  <p><strong>1Keys ðŸŽ¹ by KilledByAPixel</strong><br><span>HTML project, 1024/1024 bytes</span></p>
		  
		</header>
		  <p>This three instrument âˆ¿ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¹ piano supports play with both keyboard and mouse!
The keyboard setup mirrors the onscreen piano keyboard and allows playing simultaneous notes.
Keys light up red when played and can be held for any length of time.

Thanks to Rodrigo Siqueira for helping prototype this!

Simple Mod Ideas...
- Option to change wave shape with oscillator.type
- Octave and Root Key control
- More instruments try `456` for a major chord</p>

		  <p><strong>Avoid by KChplr</strong><br><span>2d canvas project, 1020/1024 bytes</span></p>
		  
		</header>
		  <p>A roundish game about avoiding things flying your way. Your score increases over time, so does the difficulty. Keep calm and don't go too close to the edge of the playfield.

The focus of this project was to have satisfying controls and a polished gameplay, however simplistic it may be.

[h]Controls[/h]

 - Move using the [b]arrow[/b] keys
 - Accelerate faster with the [b]X[/b] key
 - Restart the game using the [b]R[/b] key once you're hit

You are a merman ðŸ§œðŸ�½â€�â™‚ï¸� with an unlimited supply of harpoons ðŸ”±. Fishes ðŸ¦�ðŸ�¡ðŸ�&nbsp; somehow bounce around the seabed... What would you do? Split them in halves!

This is a version of Pang ([link]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_(video_game)[/link]) in 1024 bytes of JavaScript with p5.js. Erik Sombroek ([link]https://twitter.com/eriksombroek[/link]) wrote the original version with an inspiration from [em]Bubble Trouble[/em] and Kang Seonghoon ([link]https://twitter.com/senokay[/link]) minified it to fit the size.

[b]Controls[/b]

The game starts when you start moving around.

â€¢ Left/right arrow to control the merman  
â€¢ Space to shoot a harpoon  
â€¢ Enter to restart the game (even in-game)

[b]Bonuses[/b]

For each hit there is a 10% chance of bonuses. They disappear after 5 bounces, so hurry up!

â€¢ Heart ðŸ’�: You are safe from fishes for one hit.  
â€¢ Clock â�°: Everything except you and your harpoon slows down for 10 seconds.  
â€¢ Star â­�: You can shoot multiple harpoons for 10 seconds.

[b]Technical[/b]

The code was minified with Terser ([link]https://github.com/terser/terser[/link]) and RegPack ([link]https://siorki.github.io/regPack.html[/link]). The actual job is done via a (then) custom version of Terser-online ([link]https://xem.github.io/terser-online/[/link]) with tons of pre- and postprocessing code.

All sprites are done with emoji. Unfortunately different platforms have different emoji fonts, as a result the graphics might be slightly off. It should look well in macOS and reasonably well in Windows, both tested in Chrome and Firefox.</p>

		  <p>Move and attack with arrow keys.
Everything has 8hp.
Your attacks always hit and do d6 damage.
Enemy attacks do 1 damage (except certain enemies, see below), and have hit chance depending on relative levels.
Digging dirt or diamonds also costs 1hp per strike.
Levels are color coded blue=&gt;green=&gt;yellow=&gt;orange=&gt;red.
Defeating an enemy gives you 3xp for enemies below your level, 5xp for enemies of your level,
and 5xp more per each level above.
The victory also gives you 1 hp.
Digging up diamonds gives you 15 xp, but no hp.
You level up when you get 100 xp.
  
The goal is to reach the stairs at the bottom right corner.
  
OBELISK restores your hp to the max when defeated.
WOLF has no special traits.
SKELETON does not restore your hp.
WARRIOR takes 1 less damage from your attacks.
AXE GOBLIN has reduced hit chance but deals 2 damage.
FIRE ELEMENTAL self-destructs on a successful attack, removing 2 of your hp.
WIZARD deals and takes double damage.

		  <p>The idea comes from my new status as a father since the 23th of june of this year!

I always wanted to participate such little competition, but not against others, but against myself. 
This little game is dedicated to my new baby born: Nikki of course :-).

All in pure JS, HTML and CSS with a fluid display.

Please use the arrow keys to "enjoy" the cleaning and have the highest score!

Enjoy :-)</p>

		  <p>Rocket simulation near a planet

[b]How to play[/b]
- Set its orbit so that it touches target.
- New target will be set after old target has been reached.
- The game is over when the rocket falls to the planet.

[b]Controls[/b]
- Up arrow: throttle forward
- Down arrow: throttle backward
- Left arrow: turn left
- Right arrow: turn right
- W key: toggle prograde facing

[b]Note[/b]
Same with any physics game, any lag/glitch may cause your rocket to go to the infinity and beyond. :P

[b]Tools[/b]
- RegPack v5.0.3
- Google Closure Compiler</p>

August 1, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.
Ink 3 should be a significant improvement in that area.</p><p>Previously you had to use a separate <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component for applying color to text.
This could quickly get noisy:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Color</span><span> </span><span>red</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>bold</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Color</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, all functionality from <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component was merged into <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> and simplified.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>bold</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  Hello World</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>If your terminal supports extended range of colors, you can even use HEX or RGB colors.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Green</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>#005cc5</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Blue</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>rgb(232, 131, 136)</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Red</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/text-color.jpg" width="300"></p><p>Text can also have a colorful background by setting the <code>backgroundColor</code> property, which accepts the same values as <code>color</code>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>black</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>backgroundColor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  Black on Green</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> component.</a></p><p>Boxes can have stylish borders now!
Fun fact, this feature unexpectedly uncovered a range of layout issues in Ink.
I noticed how borders were rendered incorrectly around boxes and uncovered how box dimensions differ in Ink and Yoga, which sparked a rewrite of the entire rendering flow.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>border</span><span>Style</span><span>="</span><span>round</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span>  </span><span>borderColor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>paddingX</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>  </span><span>flexDirection</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>column</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>New version is available</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span>    Run </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>blue</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>npm i </span><span>-</span><span>g my</span><span>-</span><span>cli</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span> to update</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Box</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/borders.jpg" width="350"></p><p>Oh, and there are 7 border styles in total, so you can pick the one you like the most.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/border-styles.jpg" width="500"></p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#borders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">borders</a>.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a set of powerful hooks to manage your app:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#useinputinputhandler-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useInput</code></a> - Read user input.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#useapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useApp</code></a> - Exit app.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usestdin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useStdin</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usestdout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useStdout</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usestderr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useStderr</code></a> - Direct access to stdin, stdout and stderr streams.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Focus management (more on that later).</li></ul><p>I want to mention <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#useinput" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useInput</code></a> in particular, because it has seen significant improvements since Ink 2.
Now it parses user input more reliably and can properly detect when user presses combinations of keys, like Shift + Tab for example.
If it wasn't working properly for you before, I encourage you to give it a try again.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in hooks</a>.</p><p>If you need to render unpredictable and possibly large number of items, use <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component.
Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.
It lets you switch focus to the next or previous component or turn it on/off completely.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus management</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#spacer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Spacer&gt;</code></a> component is a handy box, which automatically expands to fill all the available space.
It's quite similar to the one built into SwiftUI.

        <p>There’s an italian Facebook page called “<strong>Il Programmatore di Merda</strong>” (which can be translated to “<strong>The Shitty Programmer</strong>”). I love that page.</p>
<p>They often share shitty pieces of code and memes about programming, but today I’ve seen something quite incredible:</p>

<p>There are so many wrong things in here that I don’t know where to start.<br>
If you’re a junior developer, this post will help you to understand some very bad errors written in the code above.</p>

<p>Let’s write down the above code, so that we can discuss about it:</p>

<span id="cb1-32"><a href="#cb1-32"></a><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, I don’t really know where to start.<br>
Let’s divide the errors above in 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#security-issues">Security issues</a></li>
<li><a href="#basic-programming-knowledge">Basic programming knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="#code-formatting">Code formatting</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-issues">
Security issues
</h2>
<p>We are pretty sure that the following code is running on the client side, ’cause it’s wrapped between two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags (also, is using jQuery).<br>
Don’t get me wrong, it would have been terrible even on the server side, but running that code on the client exposes your database to… everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>authenticateUser</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  )<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a function somewhere called <code>apiServices</code> which exposes a <code>.sql</code> method, where you can run SQL queries against the database.<br>
That means that if you open the console on the web page that is hosting the above code, you’ll be able to spawn every kind of query.<br>
</p>
<p>You could do something like that:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"show tables;"</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and it will return the complete list of their database tables by using their own APIs.<br>
But hey, ok, let’s pretend that this is not a real problem. But take a look at that:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>    <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>so you’re telling me that you’re saving all the passwords without hashing them?<br>
Great move! Now I can attach a debugger to the Chrome console and see every user’s password.<br>
I’m also pretty sure that an high percentage of users uses the same username/password tuple for social networks, email services, bank accounts and so on.</p>

<p>There’s also a problem on how they’re trying to setup the <code>loggedin</code> cookie:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So they’re basically using jQuery for setting a cookie which tells to the web application if a user is authenticated or not.<br>
</p>
<p>Well, <strong>NEVER SET THIS KIND OF COOKIES USING JAVASCRIPT</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to store that kind of information, cookies are the most common choice, and that’s ok! But setting them using JavaScript means that you cannot set the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute, so every single malevolent script will gain access to your cookies.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, they’re just storing a key value like <code>'loggedin': 'yes'</code>, so that’s not the case, but that’s a very bad practice.</p>
<p>Also, opening my Chrome console I could always type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1000000000000 });</code> and I will stay loggedin forever without even have an account.</p>
<h2 id="basic-programming-knowledge">
Basic programming knowledge
</h2>
<p>There are so many things to say and so little time.<br>
Obviously the <code>authenticateUser</code> function is pure garbage, and it shows some lacks of basic programming knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>

<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-16"><a href="#cb6-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-17"><a href="#cb6-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of selecting every single user inside of the database, why doesn’t he/she select just the user with a given username and a given password?<br>
What if he/she had millions of users in that database?<br>
</p>
<p>I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, <strong>why they’re not hashing passwords inside of their database?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s move on to the returning value of <code>authenticateUser</code>.<br>
For what I see, it takes two arguments of type <code>string</code> and returns a single <code>boolean</code> value.<br>
</p>
<p>So, the following piece of code, even being awful, makes a bit of sense:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>      <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>“does an user with <em><strong>X</strong></em> username and <em><strong>Y</strong></em> password exists? Yes, so I’ll return <code>true</code>”.<br>
But this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This doesn’t make sense at all.<br>
Why doesn’t this function return <code>false</code> without this always-true conditional?</p>
<p>Now let’s analyze the following code:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>$</span>(<span>'#login'</span>).<span>click</span>(<span>function</span>() <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  <span>var</span> authenticated <span>=</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>true</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a>    <span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>false</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>    <span>$</span>(<span>"error_message"</span>).<span>show</span>(LogInFailed)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The part where it’s taking the values using jQuery is ok.<br>
The problem is how it’s handling the <code>loggedin</code> cookie.<br>
</p>
<p>We’ve previously talked about the fact that I could just open my Chrome console and type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1 });</code> in order to stay authenticated for one day without even the need for an account.<br>
</p>
<p>So, how the heck does this web page know who I am?<br>
Maybe it’s just showing some private content under username/password authentication, so it’s not showing any personal data. No one will ever know.</p>
<h2 id="code-formatting">
Code Formatting
</h2>
<p>Probably the less critical part of the whole code, but we can clearly see that this developer have copied/pasted some code taken from some website.</p>
<p>Here we can see the use of the double quotes for writing strings:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a><span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we can see single quotes:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This may not look important, but it’s actually telling us that the developer has probably copied some code from StackOverflow without even rewriting it following a common style guide for the whole codebase.<br>
Of course this is a minor issue, but it show that the developer doesn’t really care about understanding how the code is working, it just want it to work in some way.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do search things on Google daily, but it is more important to understand (for instance) how to set a cookie, than copy and paste something just to make it work.<br>
What if for some reason the whole process breaks? How do you know which part of your script is not working?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m absolutely sure that the code above is fake.<br>
That’s the first time that I see a synchronous SQL query:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Normally, I’d expect something like that:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span><span>,</span> (err<span>,</span> res) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(err)<span>;</span> <span>// some error</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(res)<span>;</span> <span>// query result</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or like that:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even if <code>apiService.sql</code> returns a value synchronously (which I doubt), internally it have to open a connection to a database, make a query and send back the response, which (as you may have guessed) can’t be synchronous.<br>
</p>
<p>But even if the code above was not a fake, I’m sure that it has been written by a junior dev.<br>
During my first weeks as a developer, I’m pretty sure I wrote such bad code for my old company (sorry :D).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>It’s not a junior developer fault</strong>.<br>
Let’s pretend that the above code is real. The junior developer here is making its best for making it work.<br>
He/she have yet to learn how to properly handle SQL queries, cookies and other stuff, and that’s totally fine!<br>
</p>
<p>Senior developers should provide some form of mentorship in order to make sure that junior devs can understand their errors, and such bad code won’t go in production.<br>
</p>
<p>I know for sure that there are certain companies that doesn’t really care about the code that they’re shipping.<br>
Does it solve a problem? Deploy it.<br>
Is it written by a junior, without even an approval from a senior dev? Deploy it.<br>
</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<h2 id="update-20200803">UPDATE 2020/08/03</h2>
<p>After discussing this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i1ph52/reviewing_the_worst_piece_of_code_ever">Reddit</a>, a very nice guy reached out sharing the following Reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet">https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet</a></p>
<p>“<em>This JavaScript code powers a 1,500 user intranet application</em>”</p>
<p>so apparently I was wrong. This piece of code is not fake!</p>

                    <p><strong><em>We can take advantage of the way humans think about value.</em></strong></p><p>We know that the computer you are using is <strong>worth more</strong> than the water bottle that is on the table. That is just something we inherently know. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we probably purchased water in the past, we recognize the price of a computer. We understand that we get more value out of the computer than the bottle of water. Every human has a built-in value meter in which we value products (or services!) comparatively.</p><p>Now, assume I put you in the middle of the desert and don't give you water for two days. Suddenly the value of the water bottle climbs to the top of your value meter.</p><hr><p>When you ask a person directly what they are willing to pay for a bottle of water, they refer to their value meter. They give you an answer based on expectation and comparison rather than on how much they may potentially value it. This happening makes it hard for a person to admit the real value of your product.</p><p>This phenomenon occurs when your product is an innovation, without valid comparisons, or if the value your product provides is much higher than any substitutes available on the market. The customer suddenly does not have an accurate thermometer to measure your product against, and will often give you a much lower price point when asked directly.</p><p>Economists and psychologists have studied this phenomenon for a long time. There are many techniques to gather information on the world-famous question for any startup: <strong>How much should I price my product?</strong></p><p>We can take advantage of this phenomenon by asking the customer indirect questions on a range.</p><hr><p>One of my favorite techniques, which I believe works very well, is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter">Van Westerndorp method</a></strong>, also known as the Price Sensitivity Meter technique. Its a series of 4 simple questions you can ask your customers to determine a price range at which your product pricing matches your offering's real value. </p><p>What better way then to put those questions on a survey and ask enough people. If you survey, say, 150 potential customers, you will discover a pretty accurate price range determined by consumer value. Simple enough? Let's get started.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>make sure that customers understand your product</strong>. Consider giving customers a demo, sharing a video, or showing them detailed pictures of your product. You could include this at the top of your survey. For our purposes, let us take a picture of this yummy Gyro. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I think it would do quite well to price this Gyro.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gyro.jpg 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg 700w"><figcaption>Let's price this Gyro.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The first question you would ask is, at what particular price point is this Gyro way <strong>too expensive</strong> that you would never consider purchasing it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then you would ask at what specific price point is this Gyro <strong>getting expensive, but you would still consider</strong> buying it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>At what price point is this Gyro a really <strong>good deal</strong>?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>And, At what point is this Gyro <strong>too cheap</strong> that you'd question its quality?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Notice the answers would give us a range of prices rather than one fixed price. By answering in ranges, people tend to let go of their value spectrum and instead determine the boundaries of how valuable the product is to them. This technique is, by far, one of the most accurate ways of determining your products true value-based price through a survey.</p><p>Looking at the data for 30+ users, we would get a cumulative graph as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gyro Survey Results</figcaption></figure><p>From the results of the survey above, (about 30 entries at the time of this article.) We notice that the optimal value-based price range is between $2.5 and $3.5. At $2.5, the Gyro has approximately 15% of people who think its both expensive and too cheap. The optimal price would be the intersection of "too expensive" and "too cheap" at $3. Of course, this is just an indication of pricing and based purely on the people you have surveyed!</p><p>For anyone interested, I have created the Gyro survey <a href="https://forms.gle/EML2DwbiaEgFQWoe8">here</a> &nbsp;(feel free to take it!). I have set up a live updating-pricing <a href="https://bit.ly/2X0wQoZ">worksheet</a> to go along with it.</p><p><strong>Feel free to make a copy for your own product pricing journey, and good luck with your product pricing adventures.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The GIMP team recently informed me that the next upcoming version of GIMP will be GIMP 2.10.22 (no GIMP 3.0 just yet – womp). Though there has been no official announcements of specific features to come in this next version, there has been one feature announcement in particular that has caught my eye – the “<strong>linked layers</strong>” feature.</p>



<h2>Linked Layers – GIMP’s Answer to Photoshop’s Smart Objects?</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1286952087558004738?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIMP quietly announced (via a retweet)</a> that the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeMarmot team</a> was working on a new feature they are calling the “Linked Layers” feature (note: this has nothing to do with the “transform link” feature already found in GIMP).</p>



<p>In fact, work for this feature actually began in July 2019 (about a year ago) but, due to limited developers working on GIMP, this feature was shelved until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jehan from ZeMarmot, who recently revisited development on this feature, described the application of Linked Layers in this way: “What if you wanted to use the same background in several images? Instead of duplicating it, you could just link it from all images using it. And if you edit a bit your common background, it would automatically update the render of all images.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To me, this sounds like GIMP’s version of “Smart Objects” – the popular Photoshop feature that allows you to “link” a different file to your composition, then have that file live update in your current composition any time you make changes to it. This has many applications – especially in the world of creating universal templates that can be updated with your own design (by simply replacing the “linked image” with your own design, then re-saving that image). <strong>This is huge.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It would work like this in GIMP: you would create a new layer, and under “Fill With” you choose “Image Link” (red arrow in the image above). Choosing this option would bring up an option to select an image to link the layer to on your computer (blue arrow). You then select your image, and click “OK” to create your new layer. The layer is now linked to the image on your computer. If you were to then open that image in GIMP and make edits to it, the edits would automatically update in the linked layer inside your other composition.</p>



<h2>Why GIMP’s Linked Layers Will Be Just As Good As Photoshop’s Smart Objects</h2>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="13510" data-permalink="https://daviesmediadesign.com/gimp-is-quietly-working-on-its-own-version-of-smart-objects-and-its-just-as-good-as-photoshops/linked-layers-test-gimp-smart-objects/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg?fit=850%2C346&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="850,346" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg?fit=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg?fit=850%2C346&amp;ssl=1" src="https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg 850w, https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects-480x195.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 850px, 100vw" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg" data-srcset="https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects.jpg 850w, https://daviesmediadesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linked-Layers-Test-GIMP-Smart-Objects-480x195.jpg 480w"><figcaption><em>In this photo, which is from <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">ZeMarmot’s video demo-ing the linked layers feature</a>, you can see a new layer thumbnail/icon (red arrow) indicating that the layer is linked to another image.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of you are wondering how this feature would keep pace with Photoshop’s well-established “Smart Objects” feature. In Photoshop, not only can you link a layer from one composition to a layer or image from another composition, but you can also link vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as a layer in Photoshop, and edit that vector object essentially in real-time in either program and have the quality of the vector object remain intact.</p>



<p>Well, GIMP’s “linked layers” will do the exact same thing – using Open Source alternatives, of course. This feature will be integrated with Inkscape so that, for example, you can link a vector composition to a GIMP layer, and have the GIMP layer scale up without quality loss the way any vector object would in Inskcape. <strong>This is mind-blowing.</strong> You could also make updates to the vector file in Inkscape, and those changes would then refresh inside of the linked layer in GIMP. It would essentially create a dynamic link between the two programs.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">video ZeMarmot released showing this new “linked layers” feature in action.</a> This isn’t just a pipe-dream or concept yet to be implemented – it’s a feature they’ve demonstrated to work in a test-version of GIMP. </p>



<p>If GIMP can successfully get linked layers to work in a stable release version of GIMP, the internet, myself included, will lose its mind. And, once again, GIMP will have successfully taken a bite out of Adobe’s photo editing software lead (still without charging its users a dime).</p>



<p>In my opinion, some form of “smart object” functionality is one of the top 3 features missing in GIMP (and one of the top 3 things I get comments about on my videos – especially when doing PS vs. GIMP comparisons). Stay tuned – I will provide more information on this feature as it comes out (hopefully via a video tutorial if they get the feature implemented in one of the new release-versions of GIMP).</p>



<p>If you want to help speed up the development of this and other cool new features in GIMP, I recommend supporting the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare">ZeMarmot team on Patreon</a> so they can spend more time on GIMP development and less time on other jobs to pay their bills.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share 13 lessons I learned from my failures and my successes.</p>
<p>I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<p>While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>
      is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.
      With such a strong focus on performance, included features are carefully
      considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast. By
      making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
      However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.

<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;struct&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;floats&nbsp;for&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z&nbsp;or&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j&nbsp;+&nbsp;k</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Velocity</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Force</span><span>;</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Mass</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
<span>private</span><span>:</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>*&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>-</span><span>9.81f</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>
 
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>AddObject</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>RemoveObject</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
 
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>Step</span><span>(</span>
		<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>)</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>for</span>&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span>&nbsp;<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;apply&nbsp;a&nbsp;force</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>/</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Position</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;reset&nbsp;net&nbsp;force&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>colliderTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>

<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>
