	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I could probably achieve 300% more in 6 years as a programmer if I knew these things when I started.</p>
<h2 id="coding-is-not-about-the-coding">Coding Is Not About The Coding</h2>
<p>What do you think programming is about?</p>
<p>Writing code?</p>
<p>Writing good code?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It's just a part of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>

being a fully-fledged operating system.  This talk will demonstrate
its suitability for playing retro games, then explore the inner

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    <section>
      

      <p>
        Quick note: I don't really have a blog, but I wanted to publish this
        on my site, so this just has some quick styles applied.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
	<strong>Resolution</strong>: My Discord account has been unbanned. After posting this page on Hacker News, the head of Discord's anti-abuse team saw it and looked into the issue. It turns out that my use of a third-party Discord client called Ripcord was the reason for my ban. At the time of the ban, I had been using this client for years, but I wasn't actively using it. I was actually using the official client, hence the older title of this page, but the third-party client was open on my laptop in the background. I leave this page here to chronicle how unacceptable Discord's response to this was.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        It's true: Discord banned me for using their own client. On 1
        November, I was scrolling through my old DMs. It was kind of messy, so
        I started to close some of them (which really just <em>hides</em>
        them). After closing maybe around seven of them, Discord booted me
        back to the login screen. I thought that was weird, but I grabbed my
        phone to scan the QR code to log in, but it didn't work. Annoyed, I
        manually typed in my login details only to find that my account has
        been disabled.
      </p>

      <h2>1 November</h2>

      <p>
        On the same day, 1 November, I opened a ticket (9765093) stating that
        I wasn't sure why my account was disabled and that I would like to
        know. They had sent me an email telling me that my account had been
        disabled, but the email only listed a vague list of reasons that could
        have caused the ban, and I didn't feel that I had done any of them.
      </p>

      <h2>3 November <small>2 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 3 November, two days later, Discord got back to me and let me know
        that I had received an email stating why my account was disabled
        (false) and that they had reviewed my ban and would not be reinstating
        my account.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same day, I responded to their email, stating that their
        explanation wasn't good enough and that I hadn't done anything
        wrong. I demanded they give me an actual reason and reinstate my
        account.
      </p>

      <h2>6 November <small>5 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        Three days go by with no response from Discord. On 6 November, I send
        another response to their email, reiterating my desires and asking
        that I at least be able to transfer power of my larger servers if they
        insist on being corrupt.
      </p>

      <h2>12 November <small>11 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        Another six days without a peep from Discord. 12 November: I send yet
        another response, reiterating what I had said in previous emails and
        asking to be put in contact with a GDPR officer to get the data I
        want.
      </p>

      <h2>14 November <small>13 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        After two more days, Discord <em>still</em> has <strong>not</strong> responded outside of
        the initial email I received. On 14 November, I file a new ticket
        (9984772) and mention my previous ticket number and restate that I
        would like a reason why my account was banned and to have my account
        reinstated, considering I hadn't actually done anything besides <em>use
        their official client</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>17 November <small>16 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        After three days, on 17 November, the new ticket gets a
        response. Discord gives me the same list of reasons (a list of bullet
        points that count as "spam and/or platform abuse") and assure me that
        they understand "you may not have malicious intent, [but] we have to
        protect Discord as a whole, and this behavio[u]r can hurt Discord and
        its users." They also go on to mention that as a "one-time gesture",
        they "went ahead" (past tense) and lifted the ban on my account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hooray, I guess. I go to log in to Discord and it turns out that was a
        lie. My account is still disabled. I figure maybe it needs some time
        to propagate the change, but after hours and then days of trying, my
        account remains disabled. During these initial attempts on 17
        November, I sent a response to Discord, stating that I would like to
        know the real reason I was banned, since what I was doing while I was
        banned wasn't spam or platform abuse, it was closing old DMs manually
        with the official client, a supported use-case. I also made note that my
        account had not been unbanned.
      </p>

      <h2>18 November <small>17 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 18 November, my account is still banned despite Discord saying they
        would lift the ban, so I send a quick response asking when the ban
        will be lifted.
      </p>

      <h2>19 November <small>18 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 19 November, I ask again, noting that this is the third time I've
        replied to this ticket and still not received a response.
      </p>

      <h2>20 November <small>19 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 20 November, I open yet another new ticket (10088193), reference
        the old one, and ask why I haven't been unbanned, demanding that they
        honour their word and lift my ban.
      </p>

      <h2>25 November <small>24 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 25 November, <em>eight days</em> after I was told my account would be
        unbanned and <em>twenty-four days</em> after the ban in question, I still
        have not heard from Discord. I was (and am still) banned for doing
        nothing wrong. Discord did not deign to reply to my last ticket at
        all, but I'm filing another one today (25 Nov, 10166788). I will
        continue to update this log of communications as time goes on.
      </p>

<p><span>We are nothing but the values we carry. All through my life thus far, I tried to influence people around me with the virtues I value. Thanks to some good reading habits I had inculcated, and the fortune of being in good community of peers and mentors alike, I managed to have read some real good books. This post is about the 10 commands of egoless programming in Weinberg's book. I shall explain the commandments based on my experience here.</span></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><span>So very many decades ago, Gerald M. Weinberg authored&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2229333.Psychology_of_Computer_Programming"><u>The Psychology of Computer Programming</u></a>. In it, he listed <strong>The Ten Commandments of&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoless_programming"><strong><u>Egoless Programming</u></strong></a>, which remains relevant even today for us as not just programmers but as team-members.</span></p><p><span>Weinberg is regarded as a pioneer in taking a people-centric approach to computing, and his work endures as a good guide to intelligence, skill, teamwork, and problem-solving power of a developer. When they appear to inspire and instruct, we find that they can apply to just about every business area, and even to life itself.</span></p><p><span>Here are the 10 important lessons developers, project managers, and stakeholders would do well to keep in mind during the project lifecycle.</span></p><ol><li><p><span><strong>Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</strong><br>Mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry, so find them early, before they make it into production, learn from them, and move on.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>You are not your code.</strong><br>The point of a review is to find problems. Don't take it personally when one is found. Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://olxpeople.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPETE/pages/940179552">my words</a>, “To err is only human, repeating it is what makes you either evil or insane”.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more.</strong><br>Seek and accept input from others. You can learn new techniques if you just ask. Always remember, it is never too late to learn.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Don't rewrite code without consultation.</strong><br>It is always a good idea to pair-up and have conversations on the code that you are tempted to re-write because you think it is bad. Your risks are much lesser if the code is backed by Unit tests. The least you can do is get it code reviewed before pushing code to main-stream branch.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</strong><br>Don’t be a bully. Seriously, just don’t be one. Grow up!</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>The only constant in the world is change.</strong><br>Things change, sometime for better and sometimes for worse. There are some things in your control which you can leverage to change things for better. Be the change that you wish for good. Also be willing to accept change for the overall good of the team.</span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</strong><br>Don't wield a title like a badge of "rightness."&nbsp;<span>If you want to be loved and respected in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge. It may or may not lead to authority, but sure leads to love and respect from others. </span></span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</strong><br>Open culture is not being polite in the front and back-bitching in the back. Rise up, voice your concerns, be heard, and make your point of view by doing your homework, all with an intent to help and learn otherwise. You can’t accept defeat, if you carry the burden of your ego. </span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Don't be "the guy in the room".</strong><br>There are so many beer buddies, movie mates, cigarette companions, and what not, who can come together or fight fiercely on any non-professional topics by respecting each other; but definitely not discuss and debate openly, work related matters for team’s betterment. Just don’t be that guy in the room.  </span></p></li><li><p><span><strong>Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</strong><br>Pour your frustration on lifeless things instead of on emotional beings. Corollary, if someone were to show his frustrations on you instead of your work, be a little polite to him, discounting it as emotional down syndrome. I have been on both sides, and so will you sometime. Let us support one another and grow together.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Just to re-iterate, these commandments are still incredibly relevant. Put it to deliberate practice and with time they will bring out a better developer and co-worker in you.</span></p><p><span>You can get this book from <a href="https://amzn.to/3lZvXr9" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</span></p>

<p>Google made almost all its money from ads. It was a booming business — until it wasn’t. Here’s how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen.</p>

<p>While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook — Google’s biggest competitor in the online advertising space — got on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Google-Facebook-Increase-Their-Grip-on-Digital-Ad-Market/1015417" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Google-Facebook-Increase-Their-Grip-on-Digital-Ad-Market/1015417">right side of the trend</a>&nbsp;and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising.</p>

<p>In late 2015, Apple — Google’s main competitor in the mobile space — added a feature to their phones and tablets that allowed users to block ads.</p>
<p>Devices running iOS were responsible for an&nbsp;<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/27/apples-ios-drives-75-of-googles-mobile-advertising-revenue" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/27/apples-ios-drives-75-of-googles-mobile-advertising-revenue">estimated 75%</a>&nbsp;of Google’s revenue from mobile search ads, so by making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/24/apple-lays-the-groundwork-to-kill-online-advertising/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/24/apple-lays-the-groundwork-to-kill-online-advertising/">future of online advertising</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, as the internet went mobile, so too did ad blocking. The number of people blocking ads on a mobile device grew&nbsp;<a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/">102% from 2015 to 2016</a>; by the end of 2016, an estimated 16% of smartphone users globally were&nbsp;<a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/">blocking ads</a>&nbsp;when browsing the internet on a mobile device. The number was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Why-More-than-Quarter-of-US-Internet-Users-Block-Ads/1014333" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Why-More-than-Quarter-of-US-Internet-Users-Block-Ads/1014333">as high as 25%</a>&nbsp;for desktop and laptop users in the United States, a country that accounted for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266250/regional-distribution-of-googles-revenue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266250/regional-distribution-of-googles-revenue/">47% of Google’s revenue</a>.</p>
<p>The people most likely to block ads were also the most valuable demographic:&nbsp;<a href="http://marketingland.com/ad-blocker-usage-highest-among-key-advertiser-demos-millennials-and-high-earners-143546" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://marketingland.com/ad-blocker-usage-highest-among-key-advertiser-demos-millennials-and-high-earners-143546"><em>millennials and high earners</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Internet users had spoken, and they hated ads.</strong></p>
<p>In early 2017, Google announced its plans to build an ad blocker into its popular Google Chrome browser. Google’s ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads">Coalition For Better Ads</a>, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business.</p>
<p>Even after making this desperate and&nbsp;<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/">legally questionable</a>&nbsp;move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would&nbsp;<a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/">continue to rise</a>. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like.&nbsp;<strong>The company discovered that it wasn’t just annoying ads that people didn’t like; it was ads in general.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.5.png" width="533" height="300"></strong></p>
<p><em><sub>The advertising industry trying to figure out why people hated ads so much</sub></em><strong><br></strong></p>
</div>
<p>A key platform where Google served ads was YouTube, which it bought in 2006 and quickly turned into one of its biggest entities. But even with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html">sixth of the world</a>&nbsp;visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967">never became profitable</a>. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music">underwhelming</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube’s already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube">began to pull out amid ad placement controversies</a>, and huge revenue generators began to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797">leave the site</a>. Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “<a href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/">banner blindness</a>”. The average banner ad was clicked on by a dismal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/planning-tool/display-benchmarks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/planning-tool/display-benchmarks/">0.06% of viewers</a>, and of those clicks, roughly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goldspotmedia.com/fat-finger-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.goldspotmedia.com/fat-finger-report/">50% were accidental</a>.</p>
<p>Research showed that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/">54% of users</a>&nbsp;reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely&nbsp;<a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf">intolerable</a>. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google’s position within the industry.</p>
<p><em>Google’s mighty engine had started to sputter.</em></p>
<p><strong>A chance to pivot, and how Google missed&nbsp;it</strong></p>
<p>If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology’s history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><em>“We will move from mobile first to an AI first&nbsp;world.”</em></p>
<p>Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/">famously predicted</a>&nbsp;in 2016 that “<em>the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away”&nbsp;</em>and that<em>&nbsp;“over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.”</em></p>
<p>Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.6.jpeg" width="533" height="296"></p>
<p><em><sub>Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant</sub></em></p>
<p><strong>Google vs.&nbsp;Amazon</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1">smash success</a>. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology">too late to catch up</a>, and had no clear revenue strategy.</p>
<p>Alexa — the assistant that lived inside the Echo — on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.</p>
<p>Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.</p>
<p>Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/">far from receptive</a>. Investors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-responds-to-concerns-over-monetizing-voice-search-2017-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-responds-to-concerns-over-monetizing-voice-search-2017-1">started to voice their concerns in 2017</a>, but Sundar Pichai told them not to worry, leaving them to assume that Google would use their age-old strategy and analyze users’ voice searches so that users could be shown more suitable ads on devices with screens.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.7.jpeg" width="533" height="336"></p>
<p><em><sub>Alexa celebrating its victory over Google</sub></em></p>

By early 2017, Amazon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/competing-with-amazon-is-crushing-retailers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/competing-with-amazon-is-crushing-retailers.html">had begun closing in</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2017/02/03/amazon-go-is-the-future-plus-4-reasons-why-amazon-might-just-win-retail" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2017/02/03/amazon-go-is-the-future-plus-4-reasons-why-amazon-might-just-win-retail">the entire</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-are-going-bankrupt-at-a-staggering-rate-2017-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-are-going-bankrupt-at-a-staggering-rate-2017-4">retail industry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ads weren’t&nbsp;forever</strong></p>
<p>At its peak, Google had a massive and loyal user-base across a staggering number of products, but advertising revenue was the glue that held everything together. As the numbers waned, Google’s core began to buckle under the weight of its vast empire.</p>
<p>Google was a driving force in the technology industry ever since its disruptive entry in 1998. But in a world where people despised ads, Google’s business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable. Innovation costs money, and Google’s main stream of revenue had started to dry up.</p>
<p>In a few short years, Google had gone from a fun, commonplace verb to a reminder of how quickly a giant can fall.</p>

<p>The Shitty Tech Adoption Curve describes the process by which oppressive technology is normalized and distributed through all levels of society. The more privilege someone has, the harder it is to coerce them to use dehumanizing tech, so it starts with marginalized people.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers, prisoners and overseas sweatshop workers get the first version. Its roughest edges are sanded off against their tenderest places, and once it's been normalized a little, we inflict it on students, mental patients, and blue collar workers.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat: before long, everyone's been ropted in. If your meals were observed by a remote-monitored CCTV 20 years ago, it was because you were in a supermax prison. Today, it's because you bought a home video surveillance system from Google/Apple/Amazon.</p>
<p>The lockdown has been a powerful accellerant for shitty technology adoption curve: the combination of an atomized polity that can't have in-person solidarity conversations and overall precarity has kicked off a powerful shock doctrine for tech surveillance.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, work-from-home call-center workers (mostly poor Black women) lived under surveillance that transformed "work from home" to "live at work." The tech preserved the fiction that these misclassified employees were "independent contractors."</p>

<p>Within days of the lockdown, this technological oppression raced up the privilege gradient in the form of "invigilation" software like Proctorio, cruel surveillance tools inflicted on university students. The company is pursuing its critics in court.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/17/proctorio-v-linkletter/#proctorio</a></p>
<p>Now, every remote worker is in line to get the treatment previously reserved for misclassified employees and college kids. Microsoft has rolled out on-by-default workplace surveillance for Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1331221942850949121">https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1331221942850949121</a></p>
<p>The tool tracks every click and interaction by employees and presents managers with leaderboards showing relative "productivity" of each employee, down to how many mentions they get in workplace emails.</p>
<p>As Wolfie Christie points out in his thread, the arbitrary metrics that Microsoft has chosen will have a hugely distorting effect on workplace behavior. Remember Goodhart's Law: "Any measure becomes a target, and then ceases to be a useful measure."</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law</a></p>
<p>This is the quantitative fallacy on steroids: software can't measure qualitative factors like whether your work accomplished "soft goals" like "a better product" or "a conceptual breakthrough."</p>
<p>So they blithely vaporize these qualitative elements and do math on the dubious quantitative residue left behind. It's the data scientist's version of looking for your keys under the lamp-post: "We can't do math on it, so we won't consider it."</p>
<p>It's a far cry from the early days of Microsoft, when Bill Gates mocked IBM for paying programmers by how many lines of code they produced, calling it "the race to build the world's heaviest airplane."</p>
<p>I wonder if the programmers who built this feature are subjected to it themselves? And if not, I wonder when they will be.</p>
<p>I mean, they won't be in the EU. This shit is radioactively illegal under the GDPR. But Americans have <em>freedom</em>.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking, "I bet the managers who use this tool will regret it when <em>their</em> bosses start using it on <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>You're thinking too small. Microsoft has ambition: they're not subjecting <em>managers</em> to this, they're subjecting <em>companies</em> to it.</p>
<p>Microsoft incentivizes companies to turn on an industry-wide comparison "feature" that sends <em>all your employee data</em> to Microsoft and then gives you a chart telling you how your employees fare against their counterparts elsewhere.</p>
<p>You get a chart. Microsoft gets fine-grained data on your company's operations – data it can sell, or mine, or you know, just lose control over and leak all over the internet. That's some unprecedented Shitty Tech Adoption Curve accelerationism right there.</p>
<p>Not since the day when Amazon convinced Borders Books (RIP) to use it for all digital ordering and fulfilment (giving Amazon 100% access to all Borders' customer data) has a tech company offered a shadier B2B deal.</p>
<p>Last year, Slate's Future Tense and ASU's Center for Science and the Imagination asked me to write some fiction illustrating the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve. The result it "Affordances," a story that grows dismally more relevant with each passing day.</p>

<p>In most of the world, the lockdown has destroyed small businesses while increasing the profits of Big Tech intermediaries like Amazon, who control access to customers on one side, and access to merchants on the other.</p>
<p>The government of Argentina is trying to avert this fate. Their postal service is launching a "state-owned Amazon" called Correo Compras, which will offer low-cost ecommerce listings to businesses, and do fulfilment through  postal workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.correocompras.com.ar/">https://www.correocompras.com.ar/</a></p>
<p>Correo Compras competes directly with Mercadolibre, a latinamerican ecommerce titan with a well-deserved reputation for squeezing suppliers and workers – its deliveries are made by precarious gig economy drivers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/what-would-state-owned-amazon-look-ask-argentina/">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/what-would-state-owned-amazon-look-ask-argentina/</a></p>
<p>Correo Compras is making a bet: that by eliminating Mercadolibre's vast margin (45%!), it can pay workers a living wage, offer fair treatment to vendors, and still sell at competitive prices.</p>
<p>They're also rolling out digital payments (BNA+) provided by the Banco Nacion, competing with Mercadolibre's Mercadopagos, which has seen a surge in usage and profits (thanks to high fees) since the lockdown. BNA+ also builds in instalment payments.</p>
<p>In many ways, Argentina is well-situated to try the experiment: it has very high internet penetration, a thriving domestic tech industry, and high levels of technological literacy.</p>
<p>It also struggles with structural poverty, thanks in part to US vulture capitalists who absorb vast amounts of its GDP to service odious debts.</p>
<p>As Cecilia Rikap points out in her Open Democracy article on the venture, Correo Compras will give Argentine state planners access to important market information – data that currently sits in private hands thanks to digital surveillance.</p>
<p>But while data can improve industrial policy, it can also serve state oppression. The debt that is currently crushing the country is partly the price-tag for the former military dictatorship's program of mass surveillance, torture, murder and terror.</p>
<p>Data collected for beneficial purposes can be weaponized. The Dutch government collected data on minorities so that they could provide settlement services to them. Nazi occupiers used this data to locate minorities and ship them to camps.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6117893139176476722" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>After years of struggling to lose weight, I've lost 30 pounds this year. My number one takeaway has been realizing I need to be mindful of what I eat all day, from eyes open to going to bed.</p>

<p>For years I'd been giving up single things. No soda or juice. No desserts. No chips. No fries. Yet incredibly, whatever I did it didn't make a dent, at least not for long. Which seemed totally impossible.</p>

<p>I'd just cut out thousands of calories! And... nothing. Eventually, I realized it was like pushing down on a waterbed. I'd just end up eating the calories somewhere else. Automatically and without fail.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="381" data-original-width="750" height="326" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U2RZSjyEQRU/X8B4u5G8aVI/AAAAAAAFHHQ/_OawWuIiGL0lKvmMWlJnnVeqdd-SUMzJACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h326/image.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Maintaining good posture is easy: when you notice you are slumping, sit up straight. The hard part is noticing. What's going on at that moment when you start to slump? The exact moment when your head tilts down or your back starts to curve? Where is your mind right at that moment? How are you letting this happen? I mean what the hell, who is minding the store here?</p></div>

<p>I feel like that's exactly where my mind was when I was making a late-night snack, or grabbing another handful of chips, or digging into another piece of pizza. I was there for those moments in a way, but also not there.</p><p>Honestly, sometimes I felt like a spectator. I'd look at the snack I fixed myself and say, “Boy I should not be eating this,” then I’d sit down and eat it. Afterward, I'd say, “I should not have eaten that”. Can I talk to a manager, is there no one in charge here?</p>

<p>What finally worked was pushing the desire to lose weight down deeply into every fiber of my being, so in those moments I was present, the “I” that I wanted to be was present. Once present, the choice was actually easy. If I'm trying to lose weight, which I am, should I eat this handful of M&amp;M's? No, no I should not.</p>

<p>How to stay present? I did mindfulness meditation for several years, and I think mindfulness is what we are talking about. It's the opposite of mindlessness, and mindlessness is the enemy. What they don't advertise is there are ways to increase mindfulness without meditation. They are just... a little weird.</p>

<p>When you have an itch, even an intense one, just observe it for a while. See what happens. Often it will go away. If it's unbearable then scratch it, but not every time, and not right away.</p>

<p>If you are doing anything rushed, like writing or cleaning or typing your password in wrong, once in a while do it really slow. Like impossibly slow. The other day I was tearing a perforated piece of paper such that I waited for each single pop, then pulled it a bit more. One time I shaved so slowly that I was enjoying listening to the individual whiskers snap.</p>

<p>The goal is not just “do things slowly”. The goal is to catch yourself doing something on auto-pilot and intervene with some deliberate action. To be aware of what you were doing, then modify what you were doing mindfully. It's best to do this for different activities, sporadically. Sense that the auto-pilot has taken over, then do something to disrupt that automatic behavior.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png"><img data-original-height="282" data-original-width="425" height="424" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fievTLupx7M/X76Ld1UoftI/AAAAAAAFHG8/qIy8zP7hJ3IFRLtE0MkjzJQpY7YMIONlgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h424/image.png" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes if I'm on a mostly empty road, but I'm following someone too closely, I'll slow WAY down, until they are far in front of me. I've learned that for me this “following behavior” is very automatic.</p>

<p>After there's a gap I resume my exact same speed, but now I'm a constant five seconds behind. It's less stressful and safer, and the only downside is I'll arrive a whopping five seconds after they will. Notice you are doing something, then modify what you are doing.</p>

<p>When I finally put it together there was no grit your teeth effort required, it was just being consistently mindful of my goal, and therefore mindful as to whether my behavior was aligned with my goal. It required a light touch, not a heavy lift. If “I” was there, I'd make the right decision. If I was on auto-pilot, I'd make the wrong decision. So my goal was no longer really to lose weight, it was simply to always be there.</p>

We also planned to check out the “Back the Blue” rally in support of the police, held in nearby Congress Park. We had heard about the rally through a friend, and were intrigued by the organizer’s pledge that it would be “a positive all-inclusive” and “peaceful event.” We stood at the far edge of the crowd for 20 minutes or so, witnessed a little back-and-forth between rally participants and Black Lives Matter counterprotesters. One of the counterprotesters took a photo of us with his phone, and cursed, which seemed strange at the time. Soon after, we retreated to the comfort of our dinner. </p><p>The following morning, as I was preparing for my daily run, I took a peek at my email, and found several messages from an unknown sender. The first explained that my wife and I had become the targets of a rapidly expanding social media campaign bent on destroying our reputations and costing us our jobs. The sender was alerting us out of a sense of compassion, and asked to remain anonymous as he feared being labeled a traitor. His emails contained screenshots of messages disseminated in this campaign, including a photo of us, a long list of spurious accusations, some contact information, and templates for drafting emails to my department chair, the dean of the faculty, the dean of students, and the president of Skidmore College, where I am a professor of art, teaching jewelry design and metalwork.&nbsp; </p><p>Over the next few days, college administrators received a flood of poison-pen emails, most from the same template, alleging that we “were seen protesting with Blue Lives Matter while Skidmore alumni and students were being tear-gassed.” In point of fact, there never was any tear gas, although riot police did use pepper-bullets later that evening—many hours after we had returned home. The poison-pen emails added that I was known to be a racist and a sexist, and that I was guilty of “consistent mistreatment and disregard for non-cis white males” in my classes and advocated “exclusionary, racist and fascist ideology.” They demanded my immediate termination, as well as that of my wife, unaware that she hadn’t even taught at Skidmore since 2018.&nbsp; </p><p>The president of the college issued a guarded statement, affirming the First Amendment rights of all community members, but made no mention of the malicious campaign against me. The administration replied to those who sent individual emails (several hundred, at a minimum), pledging the college’s commitment to investigate the complaints, while avoiding any suggestion that a smear campaign conflicted with the college’s values. True to their word, the administration did investigate my teaching, combing through several years of student evaluations, searching for evidence of racial or gender bias. They would find none. Despite receiving a few personal expressions of support from Skidmore officials, Andrea and I felt wholly abandoned by the college and extremely anxious about our future. It was clear that the college would not fire me, but it was equally clear that my reputation was taking a pounding, and that the program I had worked so hard to build over the past 31 years was in jeopardy.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>A little online research revealed to me</strong> just how common it was for faculty, even tenured faculty like myself, to simply resign rather than suffer the indignity of investigations, hearings and “re-education.” But Andrea and I resolved to stay and fight. When the investigation had run its course (six weeks later), I was informed that there would be no sanctions against me. I felt nothing. No victory. Not even relief. Someone once stole my wallet in a pool hall in Terre Haute, and returned it empty. I felt much the same then.</p><p>What my detractors failed to achieve through the administrative inquest, they partly accomplished through a boycott. My once robust enrollments fell to distressingly low numbers during the first few days, with one of the classes bottoming out at zero. </p><p>Activists posted a handbill on the door of my studio classroom: “STOP: By entering this class you are crossing a campus-wide picket line and breaking the boycott against Professor David Peterson. David Peterson is notorious for the blatant sexism he treats his female students with, his outwardly transphobic treatment of trans students, and his general disregard for all students who are not white cis men…This is not a safe environment for marginalized students. By continuing to take this course you are enabling bigotted [sic] behavior on this campus.”</p><p>Leaving nothing to chance, a small contingent of student activists picketed my studio on the first day of classes, confronting the few remaining students with the fliers that denounced me as sexist and transphobic (this last claim having replaced “racist” for some reason). Peer pressure has always been a sharp tool of coercion, so I won’t fault those who opted out of my classes; I hope they wish to return in future. What I cannot guarantee is how much enthusiasm I will have when the future arrives. What was my passion is, for now at any rate, just an income source.&nbsp; </p><p>In contrast to the position of the administration, many faculty colleagues from across campus supported Andrea and me. Some offered advice, some encouragement, some were just mad as hell that our students would do such a thing and think it noble.&nbsp; Without their generosity and advice, Andrea and I might have withdrawn into bitterness and considered my resignation. </p><p><strong>Media scrutiny played an unexpected role</strong> in my case. A college paper, <em>The Skidmore News</em>, published an <a href="http://skidmorenews.com/new-blog/2020/8/31/opinion-the-petersons-amp-blue-lives-matter-students-reveal-a-pattern-of-racism-among-skidmore-faculty-and-staff">opinion piece</a> by an undergraduate, asserting (without a single example) that “there have been many claims of Mr. Peterson making students of color and queer students feel uncomfortable and unheard.” The article said that many white professors ridiculed students of color, and that members of the campus support staff made racist comments. “Students of color and Black students especially feel threatened to have staff enter their spaces or to come face-to-face with individuals that empower beliefs that inherently go against their identities,” the article said.</p><p>Within hours of the article’s publication on Aug. 31, I began receiving emails, letters and phone calls of support from a surprising mixture of folks, including alumni, parents of students, local residents and a number of journalists. Conservative media outlets, which feast on reports of cancel culture at colleges, posted their own articles, from <em>Breitbart</em> to <em>The College Fix</em> to <em><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/09/skidmore-college-professor-david-peterson-defends-his-reputation-against-student-smear-campaign/">The National Review</a></em>. The two largest regional newspapers, <em><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Churchill-At-Skidmore-curiosity-might-get-you-15553968.php">The Albany Times Union</a></em> and <em><a href="https://dailygazette.com/2020/09/26/skidmore-professor-passes-official-look-after-students-call-for-his-ouster/">The Schenectady Gazette</a></em>, also published articles, which helped replace the rumors with facts.</p><p>So, that college-newspaper article, which might have muddied my reputation further, instead provoked events that placed public opinion squarely behind me. Demands for my termination suddenly ended. Some have suggested that the events of the past year—the pandemic, the civil unrest, and the looming presidential election—were contributing factors in the students’ rush to judgement. Others cite the decline in civility in politics. I can accept this to a point. But I see nothing abrupt about the decline of civil discourse and free speech on college campuses. </p><p>Forty years ago, speech may have been freer, but it certainly was not free. Most of my professors in the 1970s endorsed leftist agendas. Yet to assert an unpopular view then simply required debate-preparation and pluck. Today, it requires almost reckless courage and prudent financial planning. No longer do I believe I can challenge the prevailing doctrines on campus without facing an emotionally charged response. Tears are not uncommon. Profanity is almost guaranteed. Wrong-thinking is no longer simply unpopular. It is downright risky.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Research confirms that left-leaning faculty</strong> outnumber right-leaning faculty by a wide margin (12 to 1 is the current consensus). The student population may be less lopsided, but only slightly. But what I wonder about are the political inclinations of non-teaching staff, such as technicians, secretaries and workers in campus facilities. Blue-collar staff are assumed to be more conservative, but this is speculation. You might think that these marginalized, voiceless, underpaid employees would be the focus of student and faculty sympathies, but you’d be wrong. </p><p>I have always felt a kinship with workers in the trades—electricians, carpenters, plumbers, and so on. My upbringing was decidedly hands-on, and many of the smartest, most generous people I have known have been those who solved problems with tools. I may be “an artist” to some, but when my father calls me “a metalworker,” he is flattering me. </p><p>I have come to know quite a few staff members, and many reached out to me when my troubles began. I, in turn, asked their views on free speech and open expression, and the allegations leveled against support staff in the student paper. Their responses were almost uniform: They preferred to leave their politics at home, and focus on their jobs when at work. More than one expressed it like this: “I keep my mouth shut, my head down, and do my job.” </p><p>Several said that they felt it was a privilege to work at the college, that they almost always enjoyed their interactions with students and faculty, and hoped their contribution was valued. I pushed harder: “What about the <em>Skidmore News</em> article?” Yes, they agreed, that was unfortunate—but not a fair characterization of their interactions with students: “These are good kids. They’ll learn when they get out in the workplace,” one said. If they were hurt by the remarks in the article, they kept it to themselves. They were, without exception, gracious and forgiving. In the search for institutional values, I would recommend these.&nbsp; </p><p>T…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is with great pleasure that we are announcing today our newest open source project <a href="https://github.com/intelligenthack/intelligentcache">intelligent cache</a>. We are very enthusiastic about this project because we think we constructed a very usable interface and ecosystem which you can rely on and extend extremely easily. Let me talk to you about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intelligenthack/intelligentcache">Intelligent Cache</a> is currently a dotnet-core, netstandard and .net 4.6.1 library but it's easily extensible to almost any other language.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intelligenthack/intelligentcache"><img src="https://imgur.com/y3ZLi1nm.png" alt="intelligent cache"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intelligenthack/intelligentcache">Fork it here</a> -- <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/intelligenthack.intelligentcache/">Nuget Package here</a></p>
<h2>The Cache</h2>
<p>At the heart of the library, there is a pattern (actually a monad) that defines two important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>what a cache should look like (an interface)</li>
<li>how to combine caches so they work together (a composition class)</li>
</ul>
<p>The cache interface at the moment is very minimalistic, as we try to include only what we actually need in production and not to add features based on perceived, but not actual, needs.</p>
<pre><code>public interface ICache
{
    Task&lt;T&gt; GetSetAsync&lt;T&gt;(string key, Func&lt;CancellationToken, Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; calculateValue, TimeSpan duration, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) where T: class;

    T GetSet&lt;T&gt;(string key, Func&lt;T&gt; calculateValue, TimeSpan duration) where T: class;

    Task InvalidateAsync(string key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

    void Invalidate(string key);
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are both async and sync versions of the cache to support both future and current systems that might not have adopted async or that will adopt it in the future. The two main methods are <code>GetSet</code> and <code>Invalidate</code>. The first returns an object from the cache and fills the cache using the given lambda if the key specified is empty or null. The second method, <code>Invalidate</code>, clears the current key and it's useful in case we know that the current cache has become stale, typically in case of updates.</p>
<p>The composition function chains together different caches so they "fall through": if the requested key is not present in the first cache, it looks in the second before actually fetching a new value. This is useful to create distributed caches, but also to add other kinds of behaviors as we will see below. The composition class has this signature.</p>
<pre><code>public class CompositeCache : ICache
{
    public CompositeCache(ICache level1, ICache level2)
    {
            // ...
    }

    // ICache implementation ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>At the moment we have 3 implementations of the cache, a local cache based on <code>MemoryCache</code>, a distributed cache based on Redis, and a passthrough cache. On top of these three basic building blocks, we have two classes that should be used together to distribute invalidation messages in case you need to keep caches in sync over multiple servers. </p>
<p>Here is what the dataflow of a full-fledged 2 tier distributed library looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GZX7yPg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This cache can be built with the following composition pattern.</p>
<pre><code>ISubscriber subscriber = GetRedisSubscriber();
var invalidationChannel = "cache-invalidations";
var cache = new CompositeCache(
    new RedisInvalidationReceiver(
        new MemoryCache(/* arguments */),
        subscriber,
        invalidationChannel
    ),
    new CompositeCache(
        new RedisCache(/* arguments */),
        new RedisInvalidationSender(subscriber, invalidationChannel)
    )
);
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, there's much more information including working examples and tests on the <a href="https://github.com/intelligenthack">intelligent cache repo</a>.</p>
<h2>Extending the cache</h2>
<p>The caching library is built to be trivial to extend with your own implementation. Let's say that you wanted to log to console all operations of a cache. This can be done very easily by extending ICache and composing:</p>
<pre><code>public class LogToConsoleBehavior: ICache
{
    public T GetSet&lt;T&gt;(string key, Func&lt;T&gt; calculateValue, TimeSpan duration) where T: class
    {
        Console.WriteLine("GetSet called");
        return calculateValue();
    }

    // other methods are implemented similarly

}

ICache cache = new Cache(); // this is the cache we want to extend with logging
var logToConsoleCache = new CompositeCache(new LogToConsoleBehavior(), cache);

// now logToConsoleCache is just like cache, except it logs to console
</code></pre>

			<p>In recent years, more and more providers of so-called Breach and Attack Simulation platforms have emerged in the market. In 2017, Gartner included Breach and Attack Simulation as a new category in the “Hype Cycle for Threat-Facing Technologies” and it was even attested that Breach and Attack Simulation has the potential to become mainstream within the next 10 years. Some even speak of a technological revolution that will fundamentally change the way companies analyze their security status in the future.</p>
<p>In this blog article I would like to answer the following questions about Breach and Attack Simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is behind this new technology?</li>
<li>What problems does BAS try to solve?</li>
<li>For which companies are BAS solutions particularly suitable?</li>
<li>Which solutions are on the market and how do they differ from each other?</li>
<li>How does Breach and Attack Simulation relate to classical <a href="https://www.cloudcape.de/en/penetration-testing/">penetration testing of enterprise networks</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<h2>What is Breach and Attack Simulation?</h2>
<p>Breach and Attack Simulation is a new way of testing IT security efforts that mimics real-world attack actions to determine if the company’s various security measures actually serve their purpose. There are three different types of BAS solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Agent-based BAS solutions:</strong></p>
<p>Agent-based solutions are the simplest form of BAS. Agents are deployed across the LAN and vulnerabilities are identified to determine which routes are open to a potential attacker to move around the network. An agent-based BAS solution is very similar to vulnerability scanning, but offers much more context.</p>
<p><strong>BAS solutions based on “malicious” traffic</strong></p>
<p>These BAS solutions generate intrusive traffic within the network between dedicated virtual machines that serve as targets for a wide range of attack scenarios. An overview is then created of which events have not been detected and blocked by the company’s own security controls. As with agent-based BAS solutions, you get information about how an attacker could move if he enters the network.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud-based BAS solutions</strong></p>
<p>BAS solutions that are cloud-based are the closest to a real attack. They simulate numerous attack scenarios from the outside via different entry points. (so-called multi-vector attacks) and thus also the network perimeter of the company. The cloud platforms are fed with the latest threats from a wide variety of sources and are therefore always very up-to-date. Being SaaS solutions, they can be implemented very quickly.</p>
<h2>What problems do BAS tools attempt to solve?</h2>
<p>BAS solutions give companies an answer to the question “Do our cybersecurity programs really work? Large companies invest heavily in security products, but still do not have the confidence that they can withstand increasingly sophisticated attacks. For financial and practical reasons it is also not possible to test entire enterprise production environments permanently and manually for security vulnerabilities. Breach and Attack Simulation fills exactly this gap and allows companies to get more out of their existing security solutions by enabling continuous testing of the enterprise network at low risk.</p>
<h2>For which companies are BAS solutions suitable?</h2>
<p>If you have a look around the BAS market, you will find that many offers are tailored to large enterprise customers with high security requirements, such as financial institutions and insurance companies. It is not surprising that Breach and Attack Simulation is especially interesting for this kind of companies. They typically have numerous security products in use, a dynamic IT landscape and a high level of IT maturity. In addition, there are high demands on IT security and high compliance pressure. High-end solutions like Breach and Attack Simulation are predestined for this environment.</p>
<p>However, there is also the possibility for smaller companies to use BAS technology. Some solution providers have made their BAS tools multi-tenant ready so that smaller companies can also benefit from them via partner companies.</p>
<p>Which products are on the market and how do they differ from each other? In the still very young BAS market, a number of companies and start-ups, mainly from Israel and the USA, are thriving. In the following I would like to introduce some selected solution providers:</p>
<p><strong>SafeBreach (Israel/USA)</strong></p>
<p>SafeBreach was founded in 2014 in Tel Aviv and is therefore one of the “older” players on the market. SafeBreach describes their product as a Continuous Security Validating Platform, which takes over the role of a virtual ethical hacker. The platform consists of two components: the cloud management console and on-premise virtual machines called “Breach Simulators”, which play so-called “War Games” among each other. SafeBreach’s solution is in fact based on “malicious” traffic that flows between the Breach Simulators themselves and the cloud.</p>
<p>SafeBreach is the pioneer in the BAS industry and now has an extensive “Hacker’s Playbook” with thousands of attack methods, which is constantly updated by the SafeBreach Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Cymulate (Israel)</strong></p>
<p>Cymulate was also founded in Israel in 2016. In 2018, Cymulate was named a “Cool Vendor” by Gartner and is probably the platform in the BAS market that gets the biggest hype. Among its successes, Cymulate has raised considerable amounts of funds from well-known venture capitalists. Cymulate advertises with particularly easy deployment and operation. Only a single agent is required in the network itself. The platform offers numerous attack vectors (e-mail gateway, web gateway, web application firewall, lateral movement, data loss prevention and endpoint security control) and can therefore simulate an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Great are the integrations to other security products, such as <strong><a href="https://www.cloudcape.de/en/vulnerability-management-as-a-service-en/">vulnerability management</a></strong>, SIEM and EDR solutions. Cymulate is very pricy. Currently, the <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0882VSXXY?ref_=srh_res_product_title">7-Vector bundle costs 7000 USD per month via the AWS Marketplace</a></strong>. However, there is also a light version with fewer attack vectors available. On Youtube, you can get a good impression of the platform:</p>

<p><strong>XM Cyber (Israel)</strong></p>
<p>XM Cyber is in my opinion another notable player in the BAS market. Since its foundation in 2016 by top leaders of the Israeli cyber intelligence community, the company has gained some attention and is currently expanding globally. The HaXM platform is relatively easy to roll out. A lightweight software agent must be installed on all critical assets, and the platform itself is delivered as Software-as-a-Service. For very security-conscious companies, the solution can also be set up on-premise. The simulations are performed in three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, all critical assets are selected</li>
<li>Secondly, attacks are simulated and all attack vectors to critical assets are revealed (this is done very clearly in the platform’s “Battle Ground” dialogue box)</li>
<li>Lastly, detailed remediation reports and security evaluations can be exported</li>
</ul>
<p>This 3-minute demo of XM Cyber gives a very good impression of the platform and shows the impressive user interface.</p>
<p><iframe title="XM Cyber Breach and Attack Simulation Demo Video" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inDj1MFxzvg?start=73&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2>How does Breach and Attack Simulation relate to manual penetration testing?</h2>
<p>The interesting question remains whether Breach and Attack Simulation can replace traditional penetration testing of networks in the future. Currently, the market adoption of Breach and Attack Simulation is not very widespread. As a penetration tester, I believe that you will not have to fear for your job any time soon. In addition, compliance requirements still demand the conducting of classic penetration tests. Last but not least, Breach and Attack Simulation is also a question of your budget – many small and medium-sized companies are already struggling to invest in a small penetration test, so it is quite doubtful if these companies will invest in an expensive BAS solution.</p>
<p>Some BAS tools on the market only offer attack scenarios that do not include exploits and should therefore be supplemented with manual pentesting in case of doubt. It should not be forgotten that a simulation remains a simulation and collected data is analyzed externally to determine what would happen in reality. This increases the probability of false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles that BAS solution providers still have to overcome, I am very confident that Breach and Attack Simulation will, as it matures, greatly reduce the need for traditional network pentesting. With good BAS solutions, it is possible to “execute” exploits that cannot cause any damage. A conscientious pentester would not even address such exploits with typical pentesting tools, because there is always the danger of damaging the customer environment. In addition, Breach and Attack Simulation provides consistent results regardless of a person’s abilities, continuously and not just as a snapshot. I am very confident that soon there will be pentest-as-a-service offerings powered by Breach and Attack Simulation that will be available to organizations of all sizes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is worth keeping an eye on the developments on the BAS market. In the future, the importance of BAS solutions will most likely increase significantly. In my opinion, Breach and Attack Simulation has the potential to become a viable alternative to classical Network Penetration Testing with increasing technological maturity and decreasing costs.</p>

<p>IPFS is here. IPFS is a de-centralized file and webhosting protocol founded on ideals of freedom and openness. The Library Genesis collection is live on IPFS as of today, accessible via <a href="http://libgen.rs/">libgen.rs</a> and <a href="https://libgen.fun/">libgen.fun</a>. IPFS is like BitTorrent but has a single global swarm, and it's accessible on the web. You can learn about the IPFS project from <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS.io</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>IPFS is the next technical revolution in peer-to-peer networking, allowing people like you to share books with readers who request them. IPFS is the next best weapon in the fight against domain take-downs and internet censorship.</p>
<p>We can now each become a founding shelf for a free, global library. Let's start.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>IPFS is simple. <em>Hosts</em> (you) <em>Pin</em> files (books) using <em>Content Identifiers</em> (CID Hashes) to share them on the IPFS network. CID Hashes can represent individual files or an entire folder. Pinning saves the files to your local computer so you can share them, and others can Pin them from you.</p>
<p>Each CID Hash for Library Genesis represents 1,000 books, or about 5 gigabytes of local file storage. 100 pins = 100,000 books! Who ever told you that you couldn't start your own library?</p>
<h2 id="copyright-warning">Copyright warning</h2>
<p>Before you begin, make sure you understand <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-do-if-your-named-bit-torrent-lawsuit.html">the legal implications of hosting and sharing copyrighted material.</a></p>
<h2 id="installing-ipfs">Installing IPFS</h2>

<p>You can more documentation for the Go-based IPFS Docker container at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/">Docker Hub.</a>.</p>
<p>/export will store your downloaded files, while the books from pinned CID Hashes will be located in /ipfs/data/blocks.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d \
--name go-ipfs \
-v $HOME/ipfs/export:/export \
-v $HOME/ipfs/data:/data/ipfs \
-p 4001:4001 \

</code></pre>

<pre><code>docker start go-ipfs
</code></pre>

<h4 id="pin-your-first-cid-hash_1">Pin your first CID Hash</h4>
<p>This 'docker exec' command runs your 'go-ipfs' container with container command 'ipfs pin add'. This CID Hash contains 1,000 books, to add it run:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Once it's complete, jump to the <a href="#cid-hash-index">CID Hash index</a>.</p>
<p>You can also access the WebUI and add or manage pins from there. Port 5001 is the API port of the IPFS docker container and contains the same UI as IPFS desktop. You can access the webui in your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui">http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cid-hash-index">CID Hash index</h4>
<p>Once you've pinned your first 1,000 you can add the next 100,000 books of the Library Genesis Scitech collection here:</p>


<h4 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h4>
<p>The IPFS swarm peer port is 4001. Opening it up will help you connect, but it is optional if you can't do so. To learn how to port forward port 4001 search your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ac1750+port+forwarding"><em>router model + port forward.</em></a></p>
<h2 id="torrents">Torrents</h2>
<p>Many volunteers have helped seed the torrents with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ed9byj/library_genesis_project_update_25_million_books/">Library Genesis Seeding Project</a>.</p>
<p>If you already downloaded the torrents you can add torrent folders to IPFS using <code>ipfs add</code></p>
<p>Start go-ipfs normally with <code>docker start go-ipfs</code></p>
<p>Configure go-ipfs to allow you link folders to the Filestore:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs ipfs config --json Experimental.FilestoreEnabled true
</code></pre>

<p>Restart with <code>docker stop go-ipfs &amp;&amp; docker start go-ipfs</code></p>
<p>Add the folders from where you saved them, starting with folder 1000:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs ipfs add $home/books/1000/ -r -w --nocopy --hash=blake2b-256 &gt;&gt;  $home/books/ipfs-add.log
</code></pre>

<p>Watch the log and check out the network activity:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs tail -f $home/books/ipfs-add.log
docker exec go-ipfs ipfs stats bw --poll=true --interval=1s
</code></pre>

      <p><strong>EDIT: Update To JANKI Method</strong><br>
For many years after I wrote this post I have continued to use flashcards to learn and have made a number of refinements to my recommendations. I summarised these points in <a href="http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method-refined">Janki Method Refined</a>, part 2 of a separate article, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JCHkqVoX598Ob_111khrGoJ5cpeh_ahU/view?usp=sharing">Guide to Autodidactism</a>, and, in 2020, within a series of YouTube videos:</p>

<p><b>This video contains my most up-to-date opinions on using SRS to improve programming. Start here.</b></p>

<p>This is a guide to becoming a productive programmer quickly. In his book <em>Outliers</em>, Malcolm Gladwell told the world it takes 10,000 hours to master something. Practice three hours a day, and you will shine in ten short years. Millions of readers felt inspired since they too could become the next Bill Gates, if only they put in the hours. As the days turned to months we discovered that 10,000 hours was a lot longer than we anticipated. Limitless potential transformed into fantasy about what might have been.</p>

<p><strong>Janki Method</strong> is an attempt to shorten the time needed to learn programming. It grew out of my impatient dream to build an automated web business that would free me financially, geographically and temporally. I didnâ€™t want to wait 10,000 hours. I suspect you donâ€™t either.</p>

<p><img src="https://confessions-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photo/file/7/anki.jpg" alt="Anki"></p>

<p>Well-intentioned learners donâ€™t always learn quickly, despite their smarts and enthusiasm. For most, eventual ability is determined by the volume of time expended. Malcolmâ€™s 10k sounds about right.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve read that learning by doing is better than passive reading; that expressing ideas in writing forces understanding; that knowledge needs constant revision to stay fresh; that creativity comes from linking disparate ideas; and that your past mistakes are your best teachers. How many of these ideas do you apply to your learning efforts?</p>

<p><strong>Janki Method</strong> is built on the suspicion that Malcolmâ€™s 10k to mastery can be hastened if you take a focused approach to learning. The core of Janki Method is the use of a spaced repetition flashcard system, <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>, programmed by the brilliant Damien Elmes.</p>

<p>By following my approach, I believe that any intelligent and disciplined reader can achieve proficiency* in a given field of programming (e.g. web applications, iPhone applications) in less than 12 months.</p>

<p>I call this the <strong>Janki Challenge</strong>, and I invite you to take part.</p>



<h2 id="problem-1-we-forget-too-quickly">Problem 1: We Forget Too Quickly</h2>

<p>Have you ever spent a week studying for an exam, only to forget 90% of what you learned within 2 months and everything else within a year?</p>

<p>Forgetting impedes learning knowledge-intensive skills such as programming. You need to remember various languages, solutions, libraries and gotchas if you want to build large applications. Because technical material can be so abstract and dry, you forget particularly quickly.</p>

<p><em>The first rule of <strong>Janki</strong> boosts your memory:</em><br>
<strong>â€œEvery time you learn something new create a question and answer flashcard and add this card to Anki.â€�</strong></p>

<p>Anki is a Spaced Repetition System. Most algorithms make computers efficient; Anki makes you efficient. Using the minimal number of repetitions necessary for permanent retention, Anki drills flashcards into your long-term memory.</p>

<p>Begin by creating a deck of flashcards called, say, computer science. A deck contains many cards, and each card consists of a question and an answer. You tag these cards with the categories that best describe their contents. For example, one card might be tagged with â€˜Railsâ€™, and another with â€˜SQLâ€™. Each card can have numerous tags, something useful given how technologies frequently overlap.</p>

<p>Over time you will build up a repository of knowledge on programming, cleanly categorized, easily searchable and regularly backed up in the cloud. Keeping a repository like this is useful, but it doesnâ€™t do anything to help you keep the knowledge inside your head. The key to this is doing your Ankis.</p>

<p>Every morning Anki calculates which cards you risk forgetting, and then prompts you to review these cards. Doing your Ankis only takes a few minutes per day, since you only need to review a fraction of your deck on any given day.</p>

<p><img src="https://confessions-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photo/file/9/daily-reviews.png" alt="daily-reviews"></p>

<p>For every card you review, Anki shows you the question side with the answer side initially blocked out. Your job is to answer the question in your head, and then reveal the answer and check whether you got it right. After you answer, four buttons appear at the bottom of the screen: â€œagainâ€�, â€œgoodâ€�, â€œeasyâ€� and â€œvery easyâ€�. Assess how easily you could recall that card and then press the appropriate button. Based on which button you press, Anki determines when next to show you that card, so answering honestly is crucial if you want the algorithm to work.</p>

<p><img src="https://confessions-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photo/file/13/question1.png" alt="question1"></p>

<p>Do this every day and you will not forget.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-we-give-up-too-soon">Problem 2: We Give Up Too Soon</h2>

<p>Most people fail to learn programming for the same reason they donâ€™t get good at playing guitar: they give up too soon. Although they practice hard for the first few weeks, they soon lose motivation, and give up before they get results.</p>

<p>Trying to learn using a rhythm of intense activity over short periods of time followed by long pauses is problematic. Your mind needs time to absorb what it learns, so learning skills cannot be condensed into a weekend. By accepting this reality and using a learning approach that emphasizes incremental daily effort, you will be less likely to burn out and more likely to succeed.</p>

<p><em>The second rule of <strong>Janki</strong> encourages a commitment to daily learning:</em><br>
<strong>â€œYou must use Anki every single day - including weekends and holidays - and commit to doing so indefinitely.â€�</strong></p>

<p>Doing your Ankis must hold the same force of habit as brushing your teeth, and you should feel naughty if you ever miss your Ankis.</p>

<p>Rule 2 isnâ€™t as demanding as it might at first seem. After a few months of practice you will be able do your Ankis in 5-8 minutes. Finding that time shouldnâ€™t be a problem either, since Anki is available on smart-phone, meaning you can review while you walk to work, sit in the bus or have a spare minute at the office. Anki even synchronizes the state of your decks across all your devices, so changes to your desktop deck will be reflected across all of your devices.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-we-learn-out-of-context">Problem 3: We Learn Out Of Context</h2>

<p>Learning out of context is wasteful. Reading a textbook from cover to cover may be interesting, but if those concepts are not relevant to the technical problems you currently face, then you will lack the mental context needed to assimilate that knowledge effectively. Incomplete understanding and wasted effort ensues.</p>

<p><em>The third rule of <strong>Janki</strong> keeps you focused on what is important in the moment:</em><br>
<strong>â€œLearn in context. Pick a project, and learn only what you need to get it done.â€�</strong></p>

<h4 id="when-i-was-writing-this-blog-post-i-didnt-know-how-to-add-images-in-the-textile-language">When I was writing this blog post I didnâ€™t know how to add images in the Textile language.</h4>

<h2 id="problem-4-we-think-we-can-learn-without-doing">Problem 4: We Think We Can Learn Without Doing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>â€œI learned about sex the hard way â€“ from a book.â€� <strong>Eddie Izzard</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like sex, programming is better and more enjoyably mastered through practice. Learning without practice insulates you from reality.</p>

<p>When you read about programming without trying out the code, you form an internal representation that is incomplete, poorly understood, and difficult to apply practically.</p>

<p>You will fail to notice critical details. Many things may seem trivial when you first read about them in a textbook. Maybe itâ€™s the placing of quotations around a parameter to a function, or rules about where whitespace is allowed. These overlooked points can often be critical in practice, and anything less than complete understanding will cripple your productivity. It is only by trying code out that you will notice the nuances of these rules, and really understanding the language, techniques, and commands in question.</p>

<p><em>The fourth rule of <strong>Janki</strong> grounds knowledge in reality:</em><br>
<strong>â€œOnly add a card to your deck after having tried to use the item of knowledge therein.â€�</strong></p>

<p>Say you are working on an application powered by an SQL database. To build it you will need to refer to literature on database design and SQL (a query language for selecting records from database tables). As you work on the application you will be exposed to new concepts. Try out each new nugget of knowledge before adding it to your Anki deck. If, for example, you read about how to delete a row in a database table, then you should try deleting an actual row in your database before creating the Anki card detailing that SQL query.</p>

<h2 id="problem-5-we-make-more-mistakes-than-we-need-to">Problem 5: We Make More Mistakes Than We Need To</h2>

<p>Our past mistakes serve as excellent memory aids. This is a major reason why we learn by doing. That said, not all past mistakes are equally effective at teaching us lessons; there is a correlation between the emotional impact of an error and the length of time that lesson will remain in memory.</p>

<p>Say you make a big mistake. You accidentally push incomplete code to a live server, taking your app down for 12 hours. You panic to fix it, and as the customer complaints flood in, you feel stupid and embarrassed. This emotional punishment serves as a strong reminder of your error, and you will be more careful when pushing code to a server in future.</p>

<p>Errors with emotional impact are, thankfully, rare, and you are unlikely to need <strong>Janki Method</strong> to learn from these. But what about the rest of the mistakes we make, where the emotional element is diminished or even absent? We may need to make these mistakes many times before eventually learning our lesson.</p>

<p>Mistake repetition is the number of times you need to commit a particular mistake over a lifetime before learning a permanent lesson. Because mistakes are costly, embarrassing and potentially career threatening, it is sensible to minimize their occurrence. Bosses, customers and co-workers understand a first time mistake, and all but the most unreasonable will forgive you. They will not, however, …</p></article></div>

The Andromeda Galaxy at 2.5 million light years away is the most distant object easily seen with your unaided eye.  Most other apparent denizens of the night sky -- stars, clusters, and nebulae -- typically range from a few hundred to a few thousand light-years away and lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Given its distance, light from Andromeda is likely also the oldest light that you can see.  Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy dominates the center of the featured zoomed image, taken from the dunes of Bahía Creek, Patagonia, in southern Argentina.  The image is a combination of 45 background images with one foreground image -- all taken with the same camera and from the same location within 90 minutes.  M110, a satellite galaxy of Andromenda is visible just below and to the left of M31's core. As cool as it may be to see this neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way with your own eyes, long duration camera exposures can pick up many faint and breathtaking details.  Recent data indicates that our Milky Way Galaxy will collide and combine with the similarly-sized Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.</p>

        <h2>An example of JavaScript automation at work in medicine</h2>

        
            <p><img src="https://joshcase.dev/img/articles/script-in-4-hours/notepad-pathology-js.png"></p><p>
    	I'm not sure if you've ever tried to write an app in Notepad - but I <b>really</b> don't recommend it. Although, when inspiration strikes, you've got to make do with the tools you've got in front of you.
    </p>

    <p>
    	You can view the the <b>pathology.js</b> script repository in its entirety on <a href="https://github.com/joshcase/pathology.js/blob/master/pathology.js">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    	If you're often frustrated with the volume of <i>"copy and paste"</i> or simple data entry required to complete a task at your workplace or elsewhere, you're probably looking at a problem that could be solved with <b>automation</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    	<b>Automation</b> refers to using computer programs to handle tedious or repetitive tasks, freeing up humans for more meaningful work.
    </p>

    <p>
    	I recently found myself in such a situation when I joined a general surgery unit at a hospital in Australia. The unit employs 4-6 junior doctors to start work up to 60 minutes before everyone else does, purely to manually update a list of patients under their care, along with their current management plans and pathology results.
    </p>

    <p>
    	 The idea is that all the clinical information is collated into a portable, easy-to-read format for the senior decision makers to digest. This document is affectionately known as <b>The Listâ„¢</b>. Here's a de-identified example of what I mean:
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://joshcase.dev/img/articles/script-in-4-hours/list.png"></p><p>
    	Once the information is organised in this way, it provides a convenient overview of the unit and the patients under our care. The problem is that creating <b>The Listâ„¢</b> is a tedious and time-consuming task that virtually all of the junior doctors I know dread. On a weekend, there might be <b>40 patients</b> on <b>The Listâ„¢</b>, all of whom need their blood tests from the last 24 hours manually entered into the correct table - all before you start work! Ouch.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Above all, it makes the job less enjoyable, and is probably a contributor to clinician burnout, as most of the clinicians I know signed up to see and treat patients rather than to fill out spreadsheets.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Unfortunately, most hospitals in Australia and indeed the world hold their information in independent silos that aren't integrated. As a result there's a huge administrative overhead associated with checking multiple sources of information and centralising it.
    </p>

    <p>
    	In this case specifically, there are typically 5 junior doctors each weekday spending anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour preparing <b>The Listâ„¢</b>. Opening our patient information system, copying patient details, cross-checking that with our pathology system, copying across the new information - <i>ad nauseam</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    	For simplicity's sake, let's say there's 5 doctors spending 30 minutes every week day doing this, as well as 1 doctor spending 1.5 hours each day of the weekend.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Assuming we're paying the doctors at overtime rates ($50 per hour), we can cost the labour used for this task annually as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
        Annual Cost ($AUD) = 50 * (5 * 5 * 0.5 + 2 * 1.5) * 52
    </p>

    <p>
    	Which gives us a grand total of <b>$40,300</b> annually. That's a truckload of public cash!
    </p>

    <p>
    	But given this task is highly repetitive and data-entry focused, could we try and automate it?
    </p>

    <p>
    	<i>Yes. Yes we can.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    	Being the lazy, bratty and entitled millenial I am, after working this job for less than one week, I knew there had to be a better way.
    </p>

    <p>
    	I initially hoped to open a dialogue with the hospital IT department to allow me to deploy a Python application to handle this task for us, but I quickly realised that this route would likely take 6 months of emailing alone before they'd even consider letting me start experimenting with the problem at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Furthermore, maintaining a Python environment on any of the computers where I wanted the script to run would be an absolute headache. So Python seems to be a no-go.
    </p>

    <p>
    	It wasn't until I realised (mid shift, I might add) that I didn't need executable rights to solve this problem at all.
    </p>

    <p>
    	I immediately took my lunch break and fired up <b>*Notepad*</b> of all apps to start throwing together the solution. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
    </p>

    <p>
    	The hospital I'm referring to uses a program called the <b>The Viewer</b> in an attempt to centralise all the information from the different silos I mentioned above. The Viewer is a browser-based web application that asynchronously loads information about a given patient and their admission through hospital.
    </p>

    <p>
    	<i>Because I take patient privacy really seriously and because I'm quite paranoid about accidentally leaking patient data, I've decided not to include a screenshot of The Viewer.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    	When you open a patient on The Viewer, it first opens a blank web page, and then subsequently sends additional web requests to each of the information silos to get information about the patient - what their recent blood tests have been, what their recent scans have shown, when their outpatient appointments are <i>et cetera</i>. It then populates this initially blank web page with the information it received from the web requests to each of the respective silos.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Any time you open a webpage, depending on which browser you're running, you can right click on the page, click <b>Inspect</b> to open a special menu, and then look for some variation of the <b>Network</b> tab. This essentially allows you to view all the web traffic that is coming to and from the page you've got open.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Here's an example of the Network tab for <i>joshcase.dev</i>:
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://joshcase.dev/img/articles/script-in-4-hours/network-tab.png"></p><p>
    	It's fairly messy to the untrained eye, but you can certainly see a few familiar things: requests to load images like <i>josh-case.png</i> (the portrait for the website footer), to load <i>main.css</i> (the file that has all the webpage structure/decoration information in it) as well as files like <i>list.png</i> that constitute the other pictures in the article.
    </p>

    <p>
    	By refreshing the web page a few times and by poking around, I eventually realised The Viewer was leveraging a script called <b>GetCompletedContent</b> to load the information from each of the information silos.
    </p>

    <p>
    	What's more, when you click on a specific web request in the Network tab, you can see which parameters were sent with the request, essentially allowing you to understand what sort of structure the server is expecting:
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://joshcase.dev/img/articles/script-in-4-hours/network-parameters.png"></p><p>
    	Again, this image isn't from The Viewer, it's also from a <i>joshcase.dev</i> request relating to MailChimp, but you can still see the Query String Parameters that represent the type of data the corresponding server is expecting.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Working this out enabled me to reverse-engineer The Viewer pathology API to poll the hospital servers for specific patient information using JavaScript. I could leverage the knowledge of the <b>GetCompletedContent</b> request and the structure it uses to request pathology information, to automatically pull the information for a given patient.
    </p>

    <p>
    	All I had to do was send a similar request to <b>The Viewer</b> servers in the way <b>GetCompletedContent</b> did:
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://joshcase.dev/img/articles/script-in-4-hours/pathology-request.png"></p><p>
    	And the beauty of using JavaScript to attack this problem is that it will run on any hospital machine at any time - as every modern browser will interpret and run JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
    	If you're new around here and don't believe me, right click on this webpage (anywhere) and click <b>Inspect</b>. Look for and click on the <b>Console</b> tab. Copy the following code, and paste it into the console text box:
    </p>

    <p>
        alert("JavaScript will run anywhere.");
    </p>

    <p>
    	And then hit enter. Awesome, right?!
    </p>

    <p>
    	Once I'd written the script to emulate the <b>GetCompletedContent</b> request for the blood test silo, there were a few other implementation details to iron out, (such as parsing the response information and compiling it nicely into a readable table) but the lion's share of the detective work had been done.
    </p>

    <p>
    	A job that once took 5 people 45 minutes to complete now takes 1 person 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
    	That's poised to save the hospital $400,000 over the next 10 years!
    </p>

    <p>
    	 Isn't technology awesome?

        <small>2020-11-25</small>
        <p>Since I left my comfy job as the tech lead for a SaaS product and went into running my own business I took a closer look at my relationship with recruiters. While working I mostly found the attention of recruiters slightly reassuring but often annoying. I think that annoyance is fairly common, usually built up from countless LinkedIn drive-by attempts from unreading keyword-hunting recruiters. I thought that now, out on my own, maybe this legion of recruiters can be my sales department. And they have been, to an extent.</p>
<p>During my first few days as a free agent I did reach out to one recruiter in particular. This was the one that had been closest to dislodging me from my previous position and I had a feeling he was a sharp one. I had also thrown my cousin at him and he had helped him land his first real ops gig. When I got in touch this recruiter quite swiftly landed me my first client. In parallel I started to accept more recruiter connections and had a lot more conversations with assorted recruitment agencies. It has netted a fair bit of work. But I dare say the hit-rate is mostly low.</p>
<p>The recruiters that I’ve found to give the best results also give recurring results. They are the people that follow up, consider your needs, balance them with client needs and make things happen. It is my feeling that there remains a large cultural gap between the majority of recruiters and developers. I’ve been thinking about how to usefully bridge that. I don’t particularly need it right now but I want to help junior developers find their way into work and more experienced developers find their way to what they actually want. I think recruiters could help there. But I think we’re still quite far off from that.</p>
<p>I reached out  about this to my network on LinkedIn (where the recruiters live). I got a response from Emy Wennerberg Kristoffersson who was willing to take a chance and reach some new developers. Emy works mostly in Sweden around Gothenburg and Helsingborg, so while she might not work in your particular area I think the information and exchange is widely applicable. We figured a good first step is to tackle some of the common skepticisms that developers tend to have around recruiters and recruitment. I hope this will be helpful. The post is not sponsored, I asked her to answer a bunch of uncomfortable and nuanced questions which I think she does gracefully. Let’s get into it.</p>
<p><strong>For some background, can you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your professional experience?</strong></p>
<p>Emy: My name is Emy Wennerberg Kristoffersson. I was born and raised in Helsingborg (south of Sweden), but moved to Gothenburg back in 2016. I am passionate about tech, human beings and business development. I settled on tech-recruitment because it gives me the opportunity to combine all of these areas. For the last three years, I have been working in the recruitment industry. I work for Bonsai Consulting, a Gothenburg-based company that specializes in tech recruitment.</p>
<p>I have always had a huge tech-interest. Though, this wasn’t something that I seized back in my younger years, at least not to a greater extent (apart from when loved ones encountered technical problems and I wanted to impress – hah!). My father has always been in the IT sector so I’m quite sure that his tech skills have influenced me. I am a people-person at heart, so I eventually decided to study Human Resources in Gothenburg. In time, I got in touch with Bonsai Consulting whereupon I started to work as a researcher, and my main task was to build a network of candidates who were open to new opportunities. After a couple of months, I leveled up to a position as a recruiter and got a bigger responsibility within the company. Back then we worked broadly in recruitment and recruited to many different industries, but due to my tech-interest, the positions that related to IT and tech always ended up on my desk. One and a half years ago, we decided to work exclusively with tech recruitment due to the enormous demand within the industry.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things in my profession is the potential for improvement in the recruitment industry. Today, I am aware that there is a lot of frustration against the recruitment profession and I do think that this is a misconception. Many jobseekers consider recruiters as an annoying part of the job search. Generally speaking, we have a pretty bad reputation (let’s talk more about this later). But the thing is, in fact, that we are an asset in a candidate’s job search and in a company’s recruiting process. My vision is to get fewer people out there to see us as an annoying piece of the puzzle, and instead see the value of taking our help as a job coach.</p>
<p><strong>Finding and hiring experienced developers has been a challenging proposition for a while due simply to enormous demand, how does this affect your job?</strong></p>
<p>Emy: The first thing that comes to my mind, is the challenge of getting the companies to understand the market and the developers’ situation. It is a bitter pill to swallow for many recruiters and companies, but today many developers have at least 4-5 opportunities available for him or her. Unfortunately, not all companies understand how coveted many developers are, and therefore they don’t understand the necessity of offering a great deal to potential employees. Not just the salary has been rising during the last years, other requirements have changed considerably as well. Today, many developers expect to be able to work remotely, having flexibility in their working day, good opportunities to develop within the company and to be able to develop their own skills (and so on…). Outstanding developers know their value on the market, and if a company’s position doesn’t sound interesting or profitable, they will go on to their next available opportunity. Many companies lack the understanding of how many offers a developer can have on their table and are therefore unable (or even unwilling) to match their needs. This is a tough nut to crack.</p>
<p>Another thing that comes top of mind is the art of standing out as a recruiter. Due to the enormous demand, many developers are likely to get contacted by a countless number of recruiters every day. The old-fashioned way of sending an email to a developer saying “Hi, here’s a job I’d like you to consider” doesn’t work today. Why? Because that developer has probably received multiple requests from other recruiters already, and my message is likely to disappear somewhere in all that noise. Over the years that I have worked as a recruiter, I have come to understand the importance of understanding the developers needs and desires before sending them multiple job descriptions, preferably even before I contact him or her. It is my duty, as a recruiter, to do my research before I expect a developer to take his or her time to talk with me. For example, If I check their Github I may find out that this developer prefers back-end development in C#/.Net, then I know that it won’t be necessary for me to contact him or her in order to talk about a front-end position where your main focus is in React and Typescript. If I don’t do my research, I’m likely to waste the person’s time. If I don’t find anything on Github or similar, then I think it is pure decency of me to first of all ask if they are interested in having a conversation with me and if they are, I can’t just throw a job description in their face without first understanding what this person is interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Has everything changed with the pandemic? Is development work hard to find now?</strong></p>
<p>Emy: A lot has changed with the pandemic. From my experience, I think that the biggest challenge for recruiters right now is that developers in general are unwilling to take on a new job, even though they might know that their current position isn’t exactly what they want. I think it’s a result of the uncertainty with the pandemic, that no one knows how it will develop and what will happen next. Since the pandemic seriously shook the market during spring and summer, many developers are worried that it will put them in a situation where they’ve left a permanent employment and the safety that it entails, to be the “last man/woman in, first out”.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the pandemic the market was disastrous, from March until September it was clear that even the IT-industry (despite the great demand) suffered from the pandemic. Many start-ups had to end their businesses and bigger companies were prohibited from hiring, many were even forced to dismiss employees in order to survive. Since August until today it has eased, and more companies dare to hire today. With that said though, companies take precautions when hiring and the processes might include more steps than normally in order to be really sure that it’s a good fit for the position.</p>
<p>I’d say that there are many opportunities on the market by now, but of course we are far from “normal”. Unfortunately, many companies demand more senior developers today, in order to fill the positions that they dismissed during spring. So, for junior developers it may still be a challenge to find their first or next position. Many companies can hire junior developers as a short-term consultant-assignment, so it is advantageous to be open to these opportunities as a junior developer.</p>
<p><strong>Is the poor reputation of the recruitment profession in tech among developers deserved or overstated?</strong></p>
<p>Emy: Sadly, I do think that it is deserved. I think that many recruiters have the wrong approach when recruiting for developer-positions. I have talked to many, many, many developers about this, and my understanding of the situation is that developers experience that recruiters don’t understand them nor their industry. And above all, many developers think that recruiters are a bit ignorant and uninterested in understanding it.</p>
<p>Recruiters and developers communicate differently, which is natural due to very different professions. …</p></article></div>

	<p><em>The following applies to minimal websites that focus primarily on text. It does not
apply to websites that have a lot of non-textual content. It also does not apply to
websites that focus more on generating revenue or pleasing investors than being good
websites.</em></p>
<p>This is a “living document” that I add to as I receive feedback. See the
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/seirdy.one/log/master/content/posts/website-best-practices.md">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>I realize not everybody’s going to ditch the Web and switch to Gemini or Gopher today
(that’ll take, like, a month at the longest). Until that happens, here’s a
non-exhaustive, highly-opinionated list of best practices for websites that focus
primarily on text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final page weight under 50kb without images, and under 200kb with images.</li>
<li>Works in Lynx, w3m, links (both graphics and text mode), Netsurf, and Dillo</li>
<li>Works with popular article-extractors (e.g.&nbsp;Readability) and HTML-to-Markdown
converters. This is a good way to verify that your site uses simple HTML and works
with most non-browser article readers (e.g.&nbsp;ebook converters, PDF exports).</li>
<li>No scripts or interactivity (preferably enforced at the CSP level)</li>
<li>No cookies</li>
<li>No animations</li>
<li>No fonts–local or remote–besides <code>sans-serif</code> and <code>monospace</code>. More on this
below.</li>
<li>No referrers</li>
<li>No requests after the page finishes loading</li>
<li>No 3rd-party resources (preferably enforced at the CSP level)</li>
<li>No lazy loading (more on this below)</li>
<li>No custom colors OR explicitly set the both foreground and background colors. More
on this below.</li>
<li>A maximum line length for readability</li>
<li>Server configured to support compression (gzip, optionally zstd as well). It’s a
free speed boost.</li>
<li>Supports dark mode via a CSS media feature and/or works with most “dark mode”
browser addons. More on this below.</li>
<li>A good score on Mozilla’s <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/">HTTP Observatory</a></li>
<li>Optimized images.</li>
<li>Maybe HTTP/2. There are some cases in which HTTP/2 can make things slower. Run some
tests to find out.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to re-iterate yet another time that this only applies to websites that
primarily focus on text. If graphics, interactivity, etc. are an important part of
your website, less (possibly none) of this article applies.</p>
<p>Earlier revisions of this post generated some responses I thought I should address
below. Special thanks to the IRC and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/akcw1m">Lobsters</a> users who
gave good feedback!</p>
<h2 id="about-fonts">About fonts</h2>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want, you could use <code>serif</code> instead of <code>sans-serif</code>, but serif fonts
tend to look worse on low-res monitors. Not every screen’s DPI has three digits.</p>
<p>To ship custom fonts is to assert that branding is more important than user choice.
That might very well be a reasonable thing to do; branding isn’t evil! It isn’t
<em>usually</em> the case for textual websites, though. Beyond basic layout and optionally
supporting dark mode, authors generally shouldn’t dictate the presentation of their
websites; that is the job of the user agent. Most websites are not important enough
to look completely different from the rest of the user’s system.</p>
<p>A personal example: I set my preferred fonts in my computer’s fontconfig settings.
Now every website that uses <code>sans-serif</code> will have my preferred font. Sites with
<code>sans-serif</code> blend into the users' systems instead of sticking out.</p>
<h3 id="but-most-users-dont-change-their-fonts">But most users don’t change their fonts…</h3>
<p>The “users don’t know better and need us to make decisions for them” mindset isn’t
without merits; however, in my opinion, it’s overused. Using system fonts doesn’t
make your website harder to use, but it does make it smaller and stick out less to
the subset of users who care enough about fonts to change them. This argument isn’t
about making software easier for non-technical users; it’s about branding by
asserting a personal preference.</p>
<h3 id="cant-users-globally-override-stylesheets-instead">Can’t users globally override stylesheets instead?</h3>
<p>It’s not a good idea to require users to automatically override website stylesheets.
Doing so would break websites that use fonts such as Font Awesome to display vector
icons. We shouldn’t have these users constantly battle with websites the same way
that many adblocking/script-blocking users (myself included) already do when there’s
a better option.</p>
<p>That being said, many users <em>do</em> actually override stylesheets. We shouldn’t
<em>require</em> them to do so, but we should keep our pages from breaking in case they do.
Pages following this article’s advice will probably work perfectly well in these
cases without any extra effort.</p>
<h3 id="but-wouldnt-that-allow-a-website-to-fingerprint-with-fonts">But wouldn’t that allow a website to fingerprint with fonts?</h3>
<p>I don’t know much about fingerprinting, except that you can’t do font enumeration
without JavaScript. Since text-based websites that follow these best-practices don’t
send requests after the page loads and have no scripts, fingerprinting via font
enumeration is a non-issue on those sites.</p>
<p>Other websites can still fingerprint via font enumeration using JavaScript. They
don’t need to stop at seeing what sans-serif maps to; they can see all the available
fonts on a user’s system, the user’s canvas fingerprint, window dimensions, etc. Some
of these can be mitigated with Firefox’s <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> setting, but
that setting also understandably overrides user font preferences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, surveillance self-defense on the web is an arms race full of trade-offs.
If you want both privacy and customizability, the web is not the place to look; try
Gemini or Gopher instead.</p>
<h2 id="about-lazy-loading">About lazy loading</h2>
<p>For users on slow connections, lazy loading is often frustrating. I think I can speak
for some of these users: mobile data near my home has a number of “dead zones” with
abysmal download speeds, and my home’s Wi-Fi repeater setup occasionally results in
packet loss rates above 60% (!!).</p>
<p>Users on poor connections have better things to do than idly wait for pages to load.
They might open multiple links in background tabs to wait for them all to load at
once, or switch to another window/app and come back when loading finishes. They might
also open links while on a good connection before switching to a poor connection; I
know that I often open 10-20 links on Wi-Fi before going out for a walk in a
mobile-data dead-zone. A Reddit user reading an earlier version of this article
described a <a href="https://i.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/k0dmpj/an_opinionated_list_of_best_practices_for_textual/gdmxy4u/">similar
experience</a>
riding the train.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pages with lazy loading don’t finish loading off-screen images in the
background. To load this content ahead of time, users need to switch to the loading
page and slowly scroll to the bottom to ensure that all the important content appears
on-screen and starts loading. Website owners shouldn’t expect users to have to jump
through these ridiculous hoops.</p>
<h3 id="wouldnt-this-be-solved-by-combining-lazy-loading-with-pre-loadingpre-fetching">Wouldn’t this be solved by combining lazy loading with pre-loading/pre-fetching?</h3>
<p>A large number of users with poor connections also have capped data, and would prefer
that pages don’t decide to predictively load content ahead-of-time for them. Some go
so far as to disable this behavior to avoid data overages. Savvy privacy-conscious
users also generally disable pre-loading because they don’t have reason to trust that
linked content doesn’t practice dark patterns like tracking without consent.</p>
<p>Users who click a link <em>choose</em> to load a full page. Loading pages that a user hasn’t
clicked on is making a choice for that user.</p>
<h3 id="cant-users-on-poor-connections-disable-images">Can’t users on poor connections disable images?</h3>
<p>I have two responses:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an image isn’t essential, you shouldn’t include it inline.</li>
<li>Yes, users could disable images. That’s <em>their</em> choice. If your page uses lazy
loading, you’ve effectively (and probably unintentionally) made that choice for a
large number of users.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-custom-colors">About custom colors</h2>
<p>Some users' browsers set default page colors that aren’t black-on-white. For
instance, Linux users who enable GTK style overrides might default to having white
text on a dark background. Websites that explicitly set foreground colors but leave
the default background color (or vice-versa) end up being difficult to read. Here’s
an example:</p>
<picture>
<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/misc/website_colors.webp" type="image/webp">
<img src="https://seirdy.one/misc/website_colors.png" alt="This page with a grey background, a header with unreadable black/grey text, and unreadable white-on-white code snippets">
</picture>
<p>If you do explicitly set colors, please also include a dark theme using a media
query: <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>. For more info, read the relevant docs
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">on
MDN</a></p>
<h2 id="image-optimization">Image optimization</h2>
<p>Some image optimization tools I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pngquant.org/">pngquant</a> (lossy)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng">Oxipng</a> (lossless)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim">jpegoptim</a> (lossless or lossy)</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp">cwebp</a> (lossless or lossy)</li>
</ul>
<p>I put together a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/3b722a843f3945a1bdf98672e09786f0213ec6f6/Executables/shell-scripts/bin/optimize-image">quick
script</a>
to losslessly optimize images using these programs in my dotfile repo.</p>
<p>You also might want to use the HTML <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element, using JPEG/PNG as a fallback
for more efficient formats such as WebP or AVIF. More info in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">MDN
docs</a></p>
<p>Most of my images will probably be screenshots that start as PNGs. My typical flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lossy compression with <code>pngquant</code></li>
<li>Losslessly optimize the result with <code>oxipng</code> and its Zopfli backend (slow)</li>
<li>Also create a lossless WebP from the lossy PNG, using <code>cwebp</code></li>
<li>Include the resulting WebP in the page, with a fallback to the PNG using a
<code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might seem odd to create a lossless WebP from a lossy PNG, but I’ve found that
it’s the best way to get the smallest possible image at the minimum acceptable
quality for screenshots with solid backgrounds.</p>
<h2 id="other-places-to-check-out">Other places to check out</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://250kb.club/">250kb club</a> gathers websites at or under 250kb, and also
rewards websites that have a high ratio of content size to total size.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking Website</a>. Motherfucking
Website inspired several unofficial sequels that tried to gently improve upon it. My
favorite is <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/">Best Motherfucking Website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.webbloatscore.com/">WebBS calculator</a> compares a page’s size with
the size of a PNG screenshot of the full page content, encouraging site owners to
minimize the ratio of the two.</p>

<p>An operating system is used to make our job easier when using graphics. In our instance, in addition to everything else. In this post, we will be writing a GPU (graphics processing unit) driver using the VirtIO specification. In here, we will allow user applications to have a portion of the screen as RAM–with what is commonly known as a <em>framebuffer</em>.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>



<p>We command the virtual GPU (virtio-gpu) by sending certain commands to the host (the device). The guest (the OS driver) has an allocation of RAM that becomes the framebuffer. The driver then tells the device, “hey, here’s the RAM that we’re going to use to store pixel information.”</p>



<p>The RAM is contiguous in our OS, but according to the specification, this isn’t strictly required. We will give the driver a rectangle. Everything that falls within that rectangle will be copied to the host. We don’t want to keep copying the entire buffer over and over again.</p>



<p>We will be using the virtio protocol that we used for the block driver here, so I won’t rehash the general virtio protocol. However, the device-specific structures are a bit different, so we’ll cover that part more in depth.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="pixels">Pixels and Resolution</h2>



<p>A framebuffer must be large enough to store \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\times\text{pixel size}\) number of bytes. There are \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\) number of pixels. Each pixel has a 1-byte red, green, blue, and alpha channels. So, each pixel is exactly 4 bytes with the configuration we’re going to specify.</p>



<p>The framebuffer for our junior GPU driver is going to support a fixed resolution of \(640\times 480\). If you’re a child of the 90s, you saw this resolution a lot. In fact, my first computer, a Laser Pal 386, had a 16-color monitor with a resolution of 640 pixels wide with 480 pixels tall.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png" alt="" width="458" height="281" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png 611w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px"></a></figure></div>



<p>There are red, green, and blue pixels so close together that by varying the intensity of these three channels, we can change the color. The closer we get to our monitors, the easier a pixel is to see.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png" alt="" width="285" height="288" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png 380w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14-297x300.png 297w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></a><figcaption>Pixels on a Viewsonic VX2770SMH-LED monitor.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see these little squares. If you squint enough, you can see that they aren’t pure white. Instead, you can see bits of red, blue, and green. That’s because each one of these little squares is subdivided into three colors: yep, red, green, and blue! To make white, these pixels are turned up to 11 (get the joke?). To make black, we turn off all three channels of that pixel.</p>



<p>The resolution refers to how many of these squares are on our monitor. This is a 1920×1080 monitor. That means that there are 1920 of these squares going left to right, and there are 1080 of these squares from top to bottom. All in all, we have \(1920\times 1080=2,073,600\) number of pixels. Each one of these pixels is expressed using 4 bytes in the framebuffer, meaning we need \(2,073,600\times 4=8,294,400\) bytes in RAM to store the pixel information.</p>



<p>You can see why I limited our resolution to 640×480, which only requires \(640\times 480\times 4=1,228,800\) bytes–a bit over a megabyte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="virtio">The GPU VirtIO Device</h2>



<p>The GPU device requires us to read a more up-to-date VirtIO specification. I’ll be reading from version 1.1, which you can get a copy here: <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html">https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html</a>. Specifically, chapter 5.7 “GPU Device”. This is an <em>unaccelerated</em> 2D device, meaning that we must use the CPU to actually form the framebuffer, then we transfer our CPU formulated memory location to the host GPU, which is then responsible for drawing it to the screen.</p>



<p>The device uses a request/response system, where we the driver make a command to request something from the host (the GPU).  We add a bit of extra memory into our request so that the host can formulate its response. When the GPU interrupts us, we can take a look at this response memory location to see what the GPU told us. This is much like the <em>status</em> field on the block driver, where the block device tells us the status of our last request.</p>



<p>Each request starts with a <em>Command Header</em>, which in Rust looks as follows:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(C)]
struct CtrlHeader {
	ctrl_type: CtrlType,
	flags: u32,
	fence_id: u64,
	ctx_id: u32,
	padding: u32
}</pre>



<p>The header is common for all requests and all responses. We can differentiate by the CtrlType enumeration, which is:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum CtrlType {
	/* 2d commands */
	CmdGetDisplayInfo = 0x0100,
	CmdResourceCreate2d,
	CmdResourceUref,
	CmdSetScanout,
	CmdResourceFlush,
	CmdTransferToHost2d,
	CmdResourceAttachBacking,
	CmdResourceDetachBacking,
	CmdGetCapsetInfo,
	CmdGetCapset,
	CmdGetEdid,
	/* cursor commands */
	CmdUpdateCursor = 0x0300,
	CmdMoveCursor,
	/* success responses */
	RespOkNoData = 0x1100,
	RespOkDisplayInfo,
	RespOkCapsetInfo,
	RespOkCapset,
	RespOkEdid,
	/* error responses */
	RespErrUnspec = 0x1200,
	RespErrOutOfMemory,
	RespErrInvalidScanoutId,
	RespErrInvalidResourceId,
	RespErrInvalidContextId,
	RespErrInvalidParameter,
}</pre>



<p>I took this directly from the specification, but Rust-ified the names to avoid getting yelled at by the linter.</p>



<h3>Pixel Formats</h3>



<p>Recall that the framebuffer is just a bunch of bytes in memory. We need to put a structure behind the framebuffer so the host (the GPU) knows how to interpret your sequence of bytes. There are several formats, but all-in-all, they just re-arrange the red, green, blue, and alpha channels. All are exactly 4 bytes, which makes the <em>stride</em> the same. The stride is the spacing from one pixel to another–4 bytes.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum Formats {
	B8G8R8A8Unorm = 1,
	B8G8R8X8Unorm = 2,
	A8R8G8B8Unorm = 3,
	X8R8G8B8Unorm = 4,
	R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67,
	X8B8G8R8Unorm = 68,
	A8B8G8R8Unorm = 121,
	R8G8B8X8Unorm = 134,
}</pre>



<p>The type, <em>unorm</em>, is an 8-bit (1-byte) unsigned value from 0 through 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents full intensity, and a number in between is a linear-interpolation between no and full intensity. Since there are three color (and one alpha), that gives us \(256\times 256\times 256=16,776,216\) different colors or levels of colors.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I selected <code>R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67</code>, which has red first, green second, blue third, and alpha fourth. This is a common ordering, so I’ll select it to make it easy to follow along.</p>



<p>Our selected format makes the pixel structure look as follows:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png" alt="" width="512" height="307" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-768x461.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1536x921.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-2048x1228.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Recall that each individual component R, G, B, and A are each one byte a piece, so each Pixel referred to by (x, y) is 4 bytes. This is why our memory pointer is a Pixel structure instead of a byte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="init">Initialization</h2>



<p>Just like all other virtio devices, we set up the virtqueues first and then we work on device-specific initialization. In my code, I just directly copied-and-pasted from the block driver into the gpu driver. The only thing I added to the Device structure was the framebuffer and dimensions of the framebuffer.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">pub struct Device {
	queue:        *mut Queue,
	dev:          *mut u32,
	idx:          u16,
	ack_used_idx: u16,
	framebuffer:  *mut Pixel,
	width:        u32,
	height:       u32,
}</pre>



<p>The specification tells us to do the following in order to initialize the device and get things ready to draw. I Rust-ified some of the content to match our enumerations.</p>



<h4>Create a framebuffer and configure scanout</h4>



<ol><li>Create a host resource using <code>CmdResourceCreate2d</code>.</li><li>Allocate a framebuffer from guest ram, and attach it as backing storage to the resource just created, using <code>CmdResourceAttachBacking</code>.</li><li>Use <code>CmdSetScanout</code> to link the framebuffer to a display scanout.</li></ol>



<h3>A Request Structure</h3>



<p>Recall that our request and response come packaged together. We will put them in separate descriptors, but whenever we get a response back from the device, it is going to be easier if we free just once to free both the request and response. So, in Rust, I created the Request structure to support doing this.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">struct Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	request: RqT,
	response: RpT,
}
impl&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	pub fn new(request: RqT) -&gt; *mut Self {
		let sz = size_of::&lt;RqT&gt;() + size_of::&lt;RpT&gt;();
		let ptr = kmalloc(sz) as *mut Self;
		unsafe {
			(*ptr).request = request;
		}
		ptr
	}
}</pre>



<h4>Step 1: Create host resource</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request::new(ResourceCreate2d {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceCreate2d,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	format: Formats::R8G8B8A8Unorm,
	width: dev.width,
	height: dev.height,
});
let desc_c2d = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).request as *const ResourceCreate2d as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;ResourceCreate2d&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_NEXT,
	next: (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16,
};
let desc_c2d_resp = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).response as *const CtrlHeader as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;CtrlHeader&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_WRITE,
	next: 0,
};
unsafe {
	let head = dev.idx;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d_resp;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).avail.ring[(*dev.queue).avail.idx as usize % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE] = head;
	(*dev.queue).avail.idx = (*dev.queue).avail.idx.wrapping_add(1);
}</pre>



<p>All we’re really telling the GPU here is our resolution and the format of the framebuffer. When we create this, the host gets to configure itself, such as allocating an identical buffer to make transfers from our OS.</p>



<h4>Step 2: Attach framebuffer backing.</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request3::new(AttachBacking {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceAttachBacking,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	nr_entries: 1,
},
MemEntry {
	addr: dev.framebuffer as u64,
	length: dev.width * dev.height * size_of::&lt;Pixel&gt;() as u32,
	…</pre></div></div></div>
