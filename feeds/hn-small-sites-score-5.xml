<div>
<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet? (280 chars)</p><p>The app should be able to add tasks, strike-through finished tasks &amp; clear all tasks.</p><p>Any general-purpose library is allowed.<br>Starting HTML body should be empty except the &lt;script&gt;.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#code</a></p></div>— Dumi (@dumindaxsb) <a href="https://twitter.com/dumindaxsb/status/1340539549890404354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0a7c7f6f4a646f727e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Modeling TLA+ in Z3Py (2020)]]>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># collects up all the variable from a formula

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span><span>,</span> <span>auto</span>

     <span>COMMITTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>ABORTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>

<span># z3 enum

<span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>()</span>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>China has received abundant ridicule for its role in Covid-19, from its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>early negligence</span></a>, to its <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/05/china-global-influence-who-united-states/611227/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>influence</span></a> over the World Health Organization, to its <a href="https://time.com/5796425/china-coronavirus-lockdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>draconian measures</span></a> to control the virus. Part of the negative perception in the West was an assumption that reporting on Covid cases and deaths within China was not to be trusted — just as the Chinese political system had failed to acknowledge the emergence of the virus, surely the government would use its extensive societal control to downplay the disease’s impacts within China.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>Months later, however, the evidence suggests that China indeed succeeded in controlling the virus. While many advanced Western democracies <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>continue to flounder</span></a>, China is almost entirely open, with kids in school, families traveling, and economic growth returning to normal. This week, The Factual used 30 articles from 20 sources across the political spectrum to explore how China achieved this outcome, whether official data for China can be trusted, and what this apparent success portends.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LhbaqO6B3R89g-SeB_4ce3UsWk3ZyK_XDD2KnfJImK5eO-ZEXwgr-B2xihV_cIVrJKPiIETuD34ZBAZnUHLFzK06JxqbxYFYTyiVV_o8drZB5GxnhDpA5YAHPi8GpvRwGIjujqeq" width="624" height="417"></p>
<div><p>Note: China’s case count is imperceptible in comparison to the U.S., EU, and UK counts. (U.S. population = 328 million; EU population = 446 million; UK population = 67 million; China population = 1.39 billion)<br>Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>By Controlling Its Population, China Controlled The Virus</strong></h4>
<p>As Wuhan experienced the first severe urban outbreak of Covid-19, media attention focused on the dystopian elements of China’s response. Citizens were locked in their residences, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/how-china-is-using-drones-to-contain-the-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drones</span></a> played out public health warnings, and government entities assumed responsibility for the delivery of necessities to citizens. But these responses were part of one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>most effective</span></a> Covid-19 interventions.</p>
<div><p>On April 7, as case counts and deaths climbed around the world, China reported its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/04/07/china-heavily-criticized-for-its-coronavirus-numbers-claims-no-new-deaths/?sh=3ba3b7ae77ad" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first day without a Covid-19 fatality</span></a>. By that point, Wuhan — the epicenter of the disease — had only reported two new cases in the prior week. The Chinese government, learning rapidly, exercised its societal control to avoid similar outbreaks in other cities. Today, China’s official statistics show a total of around 90,000 cases and less than 5,000 deaths. By contrast, the U.S. has officially registered 17 million cases, almost 190 times more than China, despite having just a quarter of China’s population.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/38aoRz3ugRGds0xMtDZjr8SoGZWFX_9peIj-dXLtJvgvahsA-Y8KoY4DiwyHd81_WfSLm8RVdfhe-2wKl4KWJTzXuGcud5fs0T-L_xtQ5xOk1XTAkdpEJzCCgz7iQnscB3RZc6Qg" width="676"></p>

<p>At the most extreme, China’s interventions involved <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/30/the-world-must-not-mimic-chinas-authoritarian-model-to-fight-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intensive restrictions</span></a> on the movement of citizens on as many as <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>750 million people</span></a>. However, since the intense first weeks, the measures have seemed comparatively less extreme, relying mostly on the routine monitoring of citizens. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>These measures</span></a> include “color-coded designations based on a person’s health status,” widespread testing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>routine temperature taking</span></a>, and careful monitoring of people entering the country — now seen as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/16/924382187/city-in-china-tests-10-million-people-after-13-covid-19-cases-are-found" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>primary source</span></a> of most new cases in China. Mask wearing was compulsory, though such orders have largely been lifted now.</p>
<p>New cases are comprehensively attacked through a combination of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/23/china-tests-millions-after-coronavirus-flare-ups-i/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testing</span></a>, contact tracing, and quarantines. For example, in October in the port city of Qingdao, the emergence of a handful of new cases led local authorities to conduct over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-testing-qingdao-city-9-million-after-12-cases-hospital-2020-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>9 million tests</span></a> in the course of five days, ultimately identifying around a dozen cases. Similarly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/11/23/china-launches-mass-testing-in-three-cities-chaotic-scenes-follow-at-shanghai-airport/?sh=783168a93ede" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a video emerged</span></a> in Western media in November of a confrontation between workers in a Shanghai airport and hazmat-wearing government officials. It was later revealed that, upon learning of a potential case, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tianjin-shanghai-coronavirus-pandemic-china-united-states-8d46e90bc0a3b75c1b5a66c196e45025" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>17,719 workers were tested</span></a> to locate a single positive case.</p>
<div><p>While it’s easy to see China’s purported success in controlling the virus as solely the result of the government’s active measures, citizen compliance and appreciation for science and health messaging has also likely <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>played a consequential role</span></a>, as has the clarity and consistency of official messaging and pre-existing proclivities toward mask usage. There has not been similar skepticism toward virus mitigation efforts nor a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/asia/china-covid-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>politicization of the pandemic</span></a>, as seen in Western democracies. High levels of compliance meshed with government action to bring about what is likely one of the fullest and fastest recoveries anywhere in the world.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Can China’s Numbers Be Trusted?</strong></h4>
<p>Skepticism of China’s handling of Covid-19 has been consistent, and it’s no surprise that many also doubt the official tallies of cases and deaths. Already receiving flak as the origin of the virus and for a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>failure to contain its spread early</span></a>, China has much to gain from positive press, meaning that “conquering” the virus would be the beginning of a much-needed win. But while this nominally gives China a motivation to underreport cases and deaths, and it by many accounts has much of the control needed to do so (consider China's <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/leaked-documents-show-how-chinas-army-of-paid-internet-trolls-helped-censor-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener">extensive censorship efforts</a> early on), there is no evidence that it is hiding significant numbers of either — at least not at a magnitude that would alter its narrative of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics point to a number of choices and anecdotes to substantiate the claim that China is obfuscating the real extent of the virus within its borders. For example, China has altered its definition of a confirmed case <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>numerous times</span></a> over the course of the pandemic and made the choice not to include asymptomatic cases in the official tally, moves that some argue are aimed at limiting the official extent of the virus. However, others have pointed out that some of these redefinitions <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>have resulted</span></a> in case counts being revised upward as well as downward and that some changes in definition are expected, given the novelty of the virus. Furthermore, the decision to exclude asymptomatic cases, while perhaps counterintuitive, has been both ridiculed and defended by experts as a plausible epidemiological choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the anecdotes used to suggest significantly worse outcomes in China do not hold up to scrutiny. For example, one such popular story from Wuhan suggested that crematoriums were <a href="https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>distributing huge numbers of burial urns</span></a> during the worst part of Wuhan’s outbreak, and extrapolations were made to suggest that many times more people were dying. Further scrutiny, however, suggests that such evidence is rather <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>flimsy</span></a>, and while we can’t be sure just how many people died in the worst days in Wuhan, there’s scant evidence to suggest that there’s been any coordinated coverup of a large number of cases and deaths.</p>
<div><p>Quite plainly, if China was trying to hold back more severe outbreaks or impacts, Chinese society would not be so <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covid-19-runs-riot-across-world-china-controls-pandemic-n1246587" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>obviously recovering</span></a>, with 240 million students in school and 637 million Chinese <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>travelling in the first week of October</span></a> for the mid-autumn festival, not far behind the 782 million that travelled during the same period in 2019. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/how-china-controlled-the-coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Full flights</span></a>, classrooms, and events returned fairly quickly to China, with authorities gathering that the risk was sufficiently low in many areas. And while China has first-rate censorship capabilities and enormous influence on the behavior of citizens, it lacks the ability to cover up or hide a serious crisis on the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks. People would be <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-china-syndrome-part-iv-did-china-fudge-its-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>documenting, discussing, and sharing</span></a> the events the same way they were able to in Wuhan at the onset of the pandemic — from watching out for family, friends, and neighbors, to recording videos of government officials, to noticing the construction of new <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-can-build-a-coronavirus-hospital-in-10-days-11580397751" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Covid-specific hospitals</span></a>. The Chinese government knows its strengths, but probably also its limitations, and seems to understand that containing the actual virus is far more beneficial and feasible than containing information about its spread.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>China’s Wins</strong></h4>
<div><p>Given what we know about the virus in China, the evidence suggests that the country really has Covid-19 under control, that the Chinese government has strategies that effectively and comprehensively keep it at bay, and that the reported numbers of cases and deaths are likely not hugely different from what has been officially reported. Western media has at times been distracted by China’s behavior in the first weeks of the pandemic, allowing those decisions to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/11/china-coronavirus-covid-19-medical-research" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>color or even discount</span></a> what has happened since. A sober assessment now reveals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/world/asia/china-xinjiang-covid.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>heavy-handed</span></a> but exceedingly effective management of the virus on a scale likely impossible anywhere else in the world.</p></div>

<p>While questions are still being asked about China’s early role in the virus’s spread, attention must also be paid to what this apparent success means for China. Economically, it has managed a rapid recovery, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/chinas-economic-recovery-quickens-as-consumption-returns-idUSKBN27404Z" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>growing by 4.9%</span></a> between July and September and profiting handsomely from a world stuck at home and dependent Chinese goods. In terms of global health, its success in managing the virus has allowed it to engage in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/global-push-covid-19-vaccines-china-aims-win-friends-and-cut-deals" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vaccine diplomacy</span></a> (rather than vaccine nationalism), helping develop and disseminate vaccines in close collaboration with other countries. And internally, some surveys show Chinese citizens indicating <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/23/913650298/as-u-s-views-of-china-grow-more-negative-chinese-support-for-their-government-ri" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more faith in the Chinese government,</span></a> especially in contrast to the dawdling responses seen elsewhere around the world. At least internally, China’s pandemic successes seem to be quickly outweighing the costs of its mistakes.</p>
<div><p>To assume that China has been similarly afflicted by the virus as other advanced countries and has simply hidden the truth would be to ignore the fundamental differences in pandemic response and government that many so keenly point out. All things considered, China’s experience with Covid-19 first reflects its weaknesses, in the hiding of the initial outbreak, but then demonstrates its <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strengths</span></a>, through intense control and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/us-has-absolutely-no-control-over-coronavirus-china-is-top-tiniest-risks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>exacting management of risks</span></a>. It turns out the truth might be rather boring: China has the capacity to implement effective physical restraints to stop the virus but probably not the ability to cover up huge numbers of Covid-related deaths. In short, the story adds up.</p></div>

						<p>According to <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uarl-asf121720.php">an announcement in EurekAlert</a>!, The U.S. Army has been researching with Duke University a technological approach that uses robotics and "biohybrid" muscle elements.</p><p>Army researchers claim that robotic systems filled with muscle tissue will deliver a new level of agility and flexibility. In order to maximize efficiency, biohybrid robotics incorporates living organisms into mechanical systems. The team's first applications are legged platforms similar to the LLAMA and Marine Corps Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the legged locomotive and movement adaptation device of the Army.</p><p>"Though impressive in their own right, today's robots are deployed to serve a limited purpose then are retrieved some minutes later," said research scientist Dr. Dean Culver, "ARL wants robots to be versatile teammates capable of going anywhere soldiers can and more, adapting to the needs of any given situation." Culver added, "Organisms outperform engineered robots in so many ways. Why not use biological components to achieve those remarkable capabilities?"</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Humanoid robot Robotis Bioloid with the hands in the air, cheering." srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580835239846-5bb9ce03c8c3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHJvYm90fGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anilinverse?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Adam Lukomski</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, a separate team from Duke University will focus on the characteristics of macroscopic performance of muscles, tendons and ligaments in skiping animals using legged robots.</p><p>The muscle tissue is excellent for generating a certain mechanical strength, and its flexibility is unrivaled in today's robotic service. The research could show the bio-hybrid engineering community how to grow strong muscular tissue instead of extracting it from a trained organism in addition to providing insight into the mesomechanics that control motor protein movement.</p><p>"Muscle tissue is outstanding at producing a specific amount of mechanical power at a given moment," says Culver, "and its versatility is unrivaled in robotic actuation today."</p>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>. The latter is long, boring, and mandatory reading.</p><h2 id="contributors">Active contributors</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>The stacked histogram above shows the number of contributors who touched the project on a yearly basis. Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins. There’s a clear periodicity caused by the semiannual release cycle. The peak month was March 2011, right before the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">GNOME 3.0 release</a>. About 450 contributors got involved that month.</p><p>The drive-by cohort is relatively smaller on a monthly basis. This makes sense, as it has little overlap from month to month, and the per-year bins tend to add them all up.</p><h3>By affiliation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, top-15 domain cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Above, the top 15 affiliations of active contributors.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias.

<p>Published on 2020-12-20 by <b>Sunaina Pai</b></p>
<h2>To Tmux or Not to Tmux, That Is the Question!</h2>

<p>
Before getting started with tmux, let us go over some questions to see
if tmux is right for you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Do you use a terminal as part of your your development workflow?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you use multiple terminals in different tabs or windows to
    navigate files, edit text, compile and run code, tail log files,
    push code to repository, and run one-time adhoc commands?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you work on multiple projects at a time, each with its own set of
    workflow and environment requirements, and often have to switch
    context?
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you SSH into remote systems?
  </li>
  <li>
    Have you ever got disconnected from a remote SSH session in the
    middle of a task that you were running and monitoring?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then tmux is for you!
</p>


<h2>What Is Tmux?</h2>

<p>
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. You can run multiple terminal programs
inside tmux, all of which can be accessed from the single terminal that
is running tmux. This is called a tmux session. You can have multiple
such tmux sessions, say one for each project you are working on. You can
detach from a tmux session and later reattach to it. When you run
programs in a tmux session, the session remains intact and continues
running your programs even if you detach from the session. You can start
where you left off the previous day, or you can even access the session
from a different computer.
</p>

<p>
If you have worked with remote servers using remote desktop connection,
you will be familiar with how the applications that you open in the
server are kept as is even when you disconnect. You can then resume the
session by reconnecting to it. You can even reconnect to the remote
desktop using a different client or a different computer. Tmux helps you
to achieve similar results for terminal sessions.
</p>

<p>
When you run the <code>tmux</code> command, tmux starts a server process
if it is not already running, and a tmux session is created. The tmux
server runs as a background process in your system and manages all the
terminals running inside tmux. You can create additional sessions in the
tmux server if needed by using the <code>tmux</code> command. A tmux
session is a group of related tmux windows. Think of all the terminal
tabs you open to get to your development workflow of a particular
project. All these can be grouped together as windows in a tmux session.
A tmux window comprises of one or more panes. Each pane is like a
terminal by itself. Panes can be organized vertically, horizonatally, or
a mix of both. Think of editing, compiling, and executing code on the
left pane while tailing a related log file on the right pane as an
example. At any given time, there is one active pane where the commands
you type are accepted. You can switch between panes, windows, and
sessions as needed.

<p>
Let us now see how to get started with tmux.
</p>


<h2>Install Tmux</h2>

<p>
If you are on a Debian, Ubuntu, or another Debian-based system, enter
the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on macOS with Homebrew installed, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>brew install tmux</code></pre>

<p>
If you are on any other system or environment, see
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing">Tmux Wiki:
  Installing</a> for installation details.
</p>


<h2>Create, Detach From, and Attach to Sessions</h2>

<p>
To create a new tmux session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux</code></pre>

<p>
Run some program in this session. Maybe tail a log file. This will help
with the next steps where you detach and reattach to a session.
</p>

<p>
To detach your terminal from a tmux session, enter the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux detach</code></pre>

<p>
Tmux will keep your session intact. All your programs keep running on
the server. To attach your terminal as a client back to an existing tmux
session, enter the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach</code></pre>

<p>
Note that it is not necessary to type out the <code>tmux</code> commands
in full. You can use any unambiguous abbreviation of the commands. For
example, <code>tmux det</code> and <code>tmux at</code> are equivalent
to <code>tmux detach</code> and <code>tmux attach</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
By default, the new sessions are named 0, 1 and so on. To choose another
name for the session, use the following command to start a new session:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux new -s &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Here <code>&lt;session-name&gt;</code> denotes the name of the session
you choose. You can also rename an existing session with this command:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
If you have multiple tmux sessions running and you want to target a
specific session to rename, you can use the <code>-t</code> option to
specify the session name you want to target, like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux rename -t &lt;session-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Without the <code>-t</code> option, it renames the current session.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-t</code> option is useful for attaching to a specific tmux
session too when multiple tmux sessions are running. By default
<code>tmux attach</code> attaches to the most recently used session that
is not attached. You can attach to a specific session like this:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
Sometimes while attaching to a tmux session, you might want to detach
the other clients to connected to it. That can be achieved with the
following commands:
</p>

<pre><code>tmux attach -d</code></pre>
<pre><code>tmux attach -d -t &lt;session-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
While you are inside a tmux session, you can also change the name of the
attached session by using the key-sequence <code>C-b $</code> which
prompts for a new name for the session. The key-sequence <code>C-b
$</code> is bound to the <code>rename</code> command that you saw above.
Similarly, the key-sequence <code>C-b d</code> is bound to the
<code>detach</code> command. To understand how tmux key bindings and
commands work together, read the next two sections.
</p>


<h2>Understand Tmux Prefix Keys</h2>

<p>
Once you attach your terminal as a client to a tmux session, all
keystrokes are sent to the program running in the active pane of the
current tmux window. By default it is your shell. For key-sequences that
control tmux itself, a special key-sequence called the prefix key must
be pressed. By default the prefix key is <code>C-b</code>. Here
<code>C</code> denotes the <code>Ctrl</code> modifier key, i.e., to
enter <code>C-b</code>, press and hold the <code>Ctrl</code> key, then
press and release the <code>b</code> key, and finally release the
<code>Ctrl</code> key. When the prefix key is entered like this, tmux
waits for another keystroke or key-sequence to determine which tmux
command needs to be executed. For example, when you enter <code>C-b
$</code> to rename the current session, <code>C-b</code> is the prefix
key that tells tmux that you are going to invoke a tmux command and then
the <code>$</code> keystroke tells tmux that you want to invoke the tmux
<code>rename</code> command.
</p>


<h2>Key Bindings, Commands, and Command Prompt</h2>

<p>
The key-sequence <code>C-b ?</code> shows the list of key bindings along
with short descriptions about what they do. The output is shown in the
view mode in the active pane. The pane in view mode has its own key
bindings which don't need the prefix key. By default the view mode has
Emacs key bindings that you can use to navigate the output. However, it
can be configured to use vi key bindings too.
</p>

<p>
Any time key bindings are used, they run the underlying tmux commands.
For example <code>C-b c</code> runs the <code>neww</code> command that
creates a new window. Commands can be run directly from the shell as you
saw when you created new session using the <code>tmux new</code>
command. Just like any other Unix commands, tmux commands have zero or
more command line options that may or may not accept arguments. For
example, the <code>attach</code> command that you saw earlier accepts
the <code>-d</code> option to detach any other clients that are attached
to the session. This option does not require an argument. The
<code>attach</code> command also accepts another option <code>-t</code>
that requires an argument to specify the name of the target session you
want to attach to.
</p>

<p>
You might mostly want to use the key bindings to manipulate tmux because
they are convenient. However, the tmux commands can be useful especially
when you want to perform a task that is supported only by an option. The
tmux commands are also useful if you want to write a script to
manipulate tmux.
</p>

<p>
Tmux commands can be run from the shell as you have seen so far. There
is also an interactive command prompt available within tmux that you can
open using <code>C-b :</code>. This prompt accepts tmux commands. For
example, <code>C-b :neww</code> creates a new window in the attached
session. Some of the tmux commands run in this manner show the output in
the view mode in the active pane. For example, <code>C-b :ls</code>
shows the list of all available sessions.
</p>


<h2>Create New Windows in a Session and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create new window in a session by using <code>C-b c</code> or
<code>C-b :neww</code>. Each window is numbered starting from 0. Every
new window is created at the first available index. This means that if
there are gaps in the list of window numbers, a new window occupies the
first available number in the gaps. The new window thus created becomes
the current window of the session. The current window is identified by
the <code>*</code> suffix in its name and the previous window is
identified by the <code>-</code> suffix in its name.
</p>

<p>
If you want to create a new window but not make it the current window,
you can do so with the <code>-d</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww
-d</code>. You can also create a window at a specific index by using the
<code>-t</code> option like this: <code>C-b :neww -t 9</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>C-b 0</code> takes you to window 0, <code>C-b 1</code> takes you
to window 1, and so on until <code>C-b 9</code>. <code>C-b '</code>
prompts for an index to switch to that window. This can be useful if you
want to go to windows with indices greater than 9. <code>C-b p</code>
takes you to the previous window and <code>C-b n</code> takes you to the
next window in the window list by index. <code>C-b l</code> takes you to
the last window that was active before the current one. This is very
useful for alternating between two windows again and again.
</p>

<p>
To rename the current window, you can use <code>C-b :renamew
  &lt;new-name&gt;</code> or <code>C-b ,</code> which prompts for the
new name for the window.
</p>

<p>
I find it convenient not to exceed 10 windows (indices 0-9) in a
session, so that I can switch between them using <code>C-b
&lt;number&gt;</code>.
</p>


<h2>Create New Panes in a Window and Switch Between Them</h2>

<p>
You can create a new pane by splitting a pane in a window. <code>C-b
  %</code> splits the current pane into left and …</p></div></div>

        <p>I recently had the opportunity to encrypt/decrypt stuff using AES, but I didn’t know it inside out well. I couldn’t help but be curious about how it is working, and I realized my mind could only be satisfied by digging deeper into its implementation.
This post walks you through how AES encryption works by reading core implementation written in Go.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aes-encryption">What is AES encryption?</h2>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher, an alternative to the DES. Cryptographers from around the world proposed algorithms, from which the Rijndael algorithm was selected in 2000. Hence we’ll take a look the implementation of this Rijndael.</p>
<h2 id="rijndael">Rijndael</h2>
<p>Rijndael is a block cipher algorithm. A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that processes a specific number of bits at a time.
The number of bits (called block length) to be processed at a time depends on the algorithm, AES is 128-bits (16-bytes). Most plaintext we encrypt is longer than this block length, so we typically use this block cipher algorithm repeatedly.
Keep in mind this post goes into some details on only on one block’s process to focus more on the core algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-implementation">Digging deeper into the implementation</h2>
<p>The Go language officially provides the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/">crypto/aes</a> package, which makes use of Go Assembly to leverage Intel’s hardware support for AES if it’s built for amd64.
It otherwise uses the implementation written in pure Go. Let’s take a look at the pure Go implementation that the human mind relatively can work in.</p>
<p>The public method <code>aesCipher.Encrypt</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/55b58018f41e6de63bdaa8f3d9a284077d4e88c1/src/crypto/aes/cipher.go#L54-L65">aes/cipher.go</a> looks to implement a block cipher:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Rijndael encrypts a block by repeating a process called a round.
In a round, there are four processes: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. As commented out in the snippet, the number of rounds depends on the key length.</p>
<h3 id="subbytes">SubBytes</h3>
<p>The conversion is done 1-byte at a time based on a conversion table called S-box which has 256 values.
Below illustrates to perform <code>sbox[s0[1]]</code> well:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-sbox.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>Unlike DES, we can see that all bytes have been converted at this point.
This post doesn’t cover AES’s S-Box as it is mentioned in many places and much better than I could do.</p>
<h3 id="shiftrows">ShiftRows</h3>
<p>The next step is to process the rows that are grouped into 4-byte units and shifted regularly to the left.
The number of bytes to be shifted depends on the line, as shown below:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-shift-rows.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<h3 id="mixcolumns">MixColumns</h3>
<p>In the previous step, it dealt with rows, but the next is to process the bytes in columns.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-mix-columns.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<p>It involves multiplication operations in a finite field, hence this step is a bit tough to describe. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns">Wikipedia</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="addroundkey">AddRoundKey</h3>
<p>Finally, it XORs the output of MixColumns with the round key. The following figure shows the execution of <code>s0[1] ^ xk[4]</code> (the <code>^</code> denotes an XOR operation in Go).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nakabonne.dev/img/aes-add-round-key.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>While this post has only shown you the encryption process, these processes are fully reversible with an Inverse MixColumns, ShiftRows, SubBytes. How beautiful!
I’ll keep reading the implementation to deepen my understanding of cryptography.</p>

            <h2>2009 - Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Far back in 2009, while following Digital Communication, Advertising and Art Direction at NABA (New Academy of Fine Arts of Milan), I became interested in Professor Massimo Banzi's classes and managed to get an Arduino Diecimila. In just one day my vision of the world had changed and I slowly started to better understand computers and electronics while sharing results with the Arduino community both on my website and on Arduino's forum. I started to build robots and after few years of experiments I launched my first start­up: a webshop of arduino-compatible, CNC machined robot kits, boards and sensors.

            <h2>2010 - Let's transmit data</h2>
            <p>
              At the time in my projects I had to connect many microcontrollers on a common bus and I found myself not satisfied by the solutions available, for this reason I started to develop my own data link. I perfectly remember that night back in 2010 when I started bit-banging bits using an Arduino and trying to sample them with another. The first problem I hit were bugs in the implementation that were quickly resolved. Then I unsterstood I did not have any synchronization, depending on when the receiver was powered on bits were shifted. That night, with no experience in electronics or engineering I instinctively defined the synchronization pulse that is still present as the core of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded Jittering Data Link) v5.0</a>. To make sure to synchronize with the start of each byte I have added a 1 longer than data bits followed by a 0 and instructed the receiver to find it and only then start sampling 8 bits. Data was coming in perfectly. That was <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/obsolete/padded-jittering-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJDL (Padded jittering data link) v0.1</a> which was basic and working by mere chance. Then, after debugging it further, experiments proved it was working well not only through wires and the human body, but also wirelessly through radio and infrared light, yet it showed to be robust operating bidirectionally in spite of interference. After I noticed that it was possible to connect more than 2 devices to the same wire, I started to experiment with an initial collision avoidance phase, an 8 bits device id and a synchronous acknowledgement at the end of the packet. It was shocking to see that many devices were able to send and receive data through the same wire. Soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.1</a> on the Arduino forum, receiving plenty of "don't ­reinvent ­the ­wheel" and few active contributors.

            <h2>2014 - Let's network</h2>
            <p>
              In those days I became aware of how quickly the cloud was eating the world and how difficult was to connect stuff directly without relying on a third-party. It seemed like noone could connect computers together anymore without an ever present observing big brother. To be honest, I did not like it: that was the point when I understood how <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON</a> could have changed the game and what I personally could have done to influence the outcome. I decided to double my efforts on the protocol and try my best to provide humanity with a free and more efficient way to make networks. With a working protocol layer and support from the community, I went further in the address space development adding an optional 32 bits bus id used to identify a group of up to 255 devices, supporting up to 4.294.967.295 buses and a total of 1.090.921.692.930 devices. This addition released in <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.2</a> enabled coexistence and networking for groups of devices. Thanks to Micheal Teeuw's post on his blog, PJON received contributions, testing, debugging and feature requests. Then many talented contributors added support for devices like ESP8266, Teensy 3.2 and Node MCU.

            <h2>2015 - Abstracting the data link</h2>
            <p>
              The community wanted to use PJON over different existing protocols and physical layers, to obtain that without making the implementation complex and more difficult to use I have defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> abstraction. The curiously recurring template pattern or CRTP was adopted to abstract the physical layer in separate classes called strategies. Thanks to this change from then it was possible to instantiate a PJON object passing the selected data link. Initially, I developed three strategies, a bit-banged implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/13.0/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md">PJDL</a> called <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang">SoftwareBitBang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/OverSampling">OverSampling</a> for radio communication and <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/AnalogSampling">AnalogSampling</a> able to communicate wirelessly or with optical fiber using off-the-shelf LEDs. Later on, I developed together with Fred Larsen <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerial">ThroughSerial</a> able to operate through a serial port.

The initial response, especially in the Hackaday's comments, was quite negative - trolls were raging. Only when I joined the discussion and answered openly and sincerely to all the complaints and questions asked, the tone changed dramatically. Well, so dramatically, that in the next comments I got the most praiseworthy compliments I have ever received, those people for sure helped me not to desist. Since then, the PJON protocol specification has been used in academic researches and PhDs in different parts of the world, and the official PJON implementation has already been applied globally in a wide range of different systems.

            <h2>2016 - Let's add a header</h2>
            <p>
              The release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v0.3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v0.3</a> was the result of the most interesting proposal I have received so far, by Fred Larsen, who is a great friend already even if we never met personally. He proposed the addition of a 8 bits header containing a map of the fields contained in the packet and the configuration requested by the sender. At this point we left a fixed configuration scenario, where interoperability was impossible, heading towards a dynamic network architecture. An entire new set of possibilities opened up and users started to make use of this new field.

            <p>

It became possible to create a PJON network of devices using also an Internet connection. Our constantly growing community has already provided PJON implementations in other programming languages like <a href="https://github.com/Girgitt/PJON-python">PJON-python</a> by Zbigniew Zasieczny and <a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/PJON-C">PJON-c</a> by Matheus Garbelini. Thanks to their work, it was for the first time possible to run PJON on a wider range of devices. At the same time the protocol reached its first stable version with the release of the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/specification/obsolete/PJON-protocol-specification-v1.0.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PJON v1.0</a> which added a lot of new features.

            <h2>2017 - Let's make it universal</h2>
            <p>
              New features brought new objectives: the community wanted to have <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON">PJON</a> working on many different MCUs and real time operative systems although I wanted to avoid code duplication and maintain only one unified implementation. For this reason I defined the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces">interface</a> abstraction. With interfaces it was for the first time possible to run and cross-compile the same implementation on all supported targets. I developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/RPI">RPI</a> interface to support Raspberry Pi, after few weeks Zbigniew Zasieczny developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/WINX86">WINX86</a> interface enabling PJON communication on Windows computers, and soon after, Fred Larsen developed the <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/interfaces/LINUX">LINUX</a> interface. In late 2017 I discovered that frame inizialization was missing from both the specification and the implementation and that arbitrary data could have been mistaken for a valid frame. I vividly remember how shocked I was, that was a serious hole, so I quickly found a way to safely identify frames in each strategy. After that was fixed and all seemed perfect I discovered the <a href="https://betterembsw.blogspot.com/2012/02/can-protocol-vulnerabilities.html">length corruption vulnerability</a> that affected PJON and still affects CAN (Controlled Area Network). To close that hole I added an additional CRC8 to protect the header and soon after I released <a href="https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/9.0/specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v2.0.md">PJON v2.0</a>.

            <h2>2018 - Distributed field test</h2>
            <p>
              Although PJON is licensed "AS IS", the more it was applied in the real world, the more I was feeling the responsibility for possible failures. When in 2018 Fred Larsen used PJON and <a href="https://github.com/fredilarsen/ModuleInterface">ModuleInterface</a> to handle the life support systems of his hens' house in Norway I started to be preoccupied for those animals and be finally aware of the potential consequencies and the risks involved in PJON real world applications, specially if dealing with living beings. If for whatever reason the temperature value transmitted was corrupted by interference or because of a bug, the hens could have ended up frozen or roasted. The conception of this possibility pushed me to study deeper the implementation and make better software.

<p>Hey guys, today I am going to talk about some features of the <code>print()</code> function in python. You will probably have come across some of these functions while others could seem new.</p>
<p>Let's start by understanding the basics of the print function. 
In python, the built-in print function is used to print all kinds of stuff - text, numbers, objects, dictionaries etc.
But how does this function handle that ?! You might think; it just can do it, it was made for that. But in reality, the print function in python can only handle strings.</p>
<p>Under the hood, anything you pass to the <code>print()</code> function gets converted to a string before being printed to your screen. That mean it will make use of the <code>str()</code> type casting and convert all other data types to strings before displaying them to your console/terminal.
Now that you know how the <code>print()</code> work, let's dive into its features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, print doesn't know how to print text to the screen. I won't go detail into that for now. Later in this post, you will know what happens under it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can print whatever you want . The simplest example you have come across is <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
It take a string enclosed in double quotes or single quotes and prints it.
You can also print multiple stuff by simply separating them with comas as such :</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age)

</code></pre>
<p>You can as well print text that takes more than a line. In this case, you will be using the newline escape character <code>\n</code>
Example :</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello \nWorld"</span>)



</code></pre>
<p>You can also format text with it. Making use of <code>f-strings</code></p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Samson"</span>
print(<span>f"Hello <span>{name}</span>"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>The example above showcase the basics of the print function. It can take a variable number of values to print. Other than that, there are also some keyword arguments.
Let's dive into them</p>
<h2 id="1-separator">1. Separator</h2>
<p><code>print()</code> allows you to decide what separates text we print with it. By default, all the values you pass to it are separated by empty strings. But we change that. It suffices to include <code>sep=</code> followed by whatever you want to separate your text.
Let's make use of the previous example.</p>
<pre><code>name = <span>"Mike"</span>
age = <span>24</span>
print(<span>"Hello"</span>, name, <span>"Your age is"</span>, age, sep=<span>"-"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>You notice that all what we passed into it separately are separated by a <code>-</code>. You can modify that however you want. You just need to make sure the separator is a valid string.</p>
<h2 id="2-ending">2. Ending</h2>
<p>You can specify by whatever you want your output to end with. By default, what you print end with a newline escape character <code>\n</code>. Let's change that and see what happens</p>
<pre><code>
print(<span>"Hello James"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>)





print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>""</span>)


</code></pre>
<p>If we execute that, we notice the text is no more separated by a new line. Let's try that again! But this time, we want it to end by <code>y</code> and move to a new line.</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>"Hello James"</span>, end=<span>"y\n"</span>)
print(<span>"How are you doing"</span>, end=<span>"\n"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We get the following output</p>
<pre><code><span>Hello</span> Jamesy
How are you doingy
</code></pre><p>Yay it worked !</p>
<h2 id="3-writing-to-a-file">3. Writing to a file</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this post, I said python doesn't know how to print stuff to the screen by itself. It rather uses <code>sys.stdout</code> and writes your text to that file. 
Wait what ! Print will write text to a file object which I sent to your screen via <code>sys.stdout</code>. Therefore, you can modify this behaviour too in order to have this printed elsewhere.
Let's give it a try.
Write the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> open(<span>"hello.txt"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> file_object:
        print(<span>"This message is for you"</span>, file=file_object)
</code></pre>
<p>Executing the above will end in a file name <code>hello.text</code> in the same directory with the text <em>This message is for you</em> in it. 
Therefore, we can direct where we want our text to be printed. In this case, we created a file name <code>hello.txt</code> and use the <code>file</code> keyword argument to direct the result to be written to that file rather than our terminal. You can use this to direct any result to wherever you want, even through a socket connection.</p>
<h2 id="4-flushing">4. Flushing</h2>
<p>This one requires an example. Let's have one!</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>" "</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>What this code should do is; print a name after a second. Try and run it and see what happens. 
You notice it unexpectedly waits and print all at once.  This is because since it's on a single line, it is all buffered (packed) before we get it. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20data,from%20one%20place%20to%20another.&amp;text=However%2C%20a%20buffer%20may%20be,comparable%20to%20buffers%20in%20telecommunication.">Read more about buffers here</a>
But we could go around that by simply adding the <code>flush=</code> keyword argument to the print function. By default it it set to <code>False</code>. Setting it to true will ensure every print statement is executed and freed from buffer before the next one.
The following code will make it :</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> time

names = [<span>"John"</span>, <span>"Sylvia"</span>, <span>"Smith"</span>]

<span>for</span> name <span>in</span> names:
    print(name, end=<span>", "</span>, flush=<span>True</span>)
    time.sleep(<span>1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run it. It will print a name, sleep for a second and print another, all on the same line. 
Yay we did it !</p>
<p>You have reached the end of this post.

            <p>
            In this post we will tackle Artificial Intelligence with baby steps and try to build a very simple neural net in Java.
            </p>

            <h5 id="what-is-a-neural-net">What is a Neural net?</h5>

            <p>
            A neural net is a software representation of how the brain works. Unfortunately, we do not know as of yet how exactly does the brain really work but we do know a little bit of the biology behind this process: the human brain consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. If sufficient synapses connected to a neuron fire, then that neuron will also fire. This process is known as "thinking".
            </p>

            <p>
            We thus try and model the above process using a very simple example that has 3 inputs (synapses) and results in a single output (1 neuron firing).

            <img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem.png" width="400">
            </p>



            <h5 id="a-simple-problem">A simple problem</h5>

            <p>
            We will train our above neural net to solve the following problem. Can you figure out the pattern and guess what the value of the new input should be? 0 or 1?
            </p>

            <div>
              <table>
              <tbody><tr>
                <th>Examples</th>
                <th colspan="3">Input</th>
                <th>Output</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Example 1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 2</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 3</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Example 4</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="5">&nbsp;</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>New situation</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>?</td>
              </tr>

              </tbody></table>
            </div>

            <p>
            The answer is actually very simply the value of the left-most column, i.e. 1!
            </p>


            <h5 id="training-process">The training process</h5>

            <p>
            So now that we have the model of a human brain, we will try and get our neural net to learn what the pattern is given the training set. We will first assign each input a random number to produce an output.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Neural net example" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-simple-problem-neuron-weights.png" width="400"></p><p>
            The formula for calculating the output is given as follows:
            $$\sum weight_i . input_i = weight1 . input1 + weight2 . input2 + weight3 . input3$$
            </p>

            <p>
            As it turns out we would like to normalize this output value to something between 0 and 1 so that the prediction makes sense. After normalization we compare the output with the expected output of our inputs. This gives us the error, or how far off is our prediction. We can then use this error to slightly adjust the weights of our neural net and try our luck on the same input again. This can be summarized in the following image:
            </p>

            <!--
            <div>
                <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png">
                    <img class="img-responsive centered img-border" alt="Neural net training process" src="/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" />
                </a>
                <div class="img-desc">
                </div>
            </div>
            -->

            <p><img alt="Neural net training process" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/nn-1-training-process.png" width="450"></p><p>
            We repeat this training process for all the inputs <i><b>10,000 times</b></i> to reach a satisfactorily trained neural net. We can then use this neural net to make predictions on new inputs!
            </p>

            <p>
            Before we jump into the implementation however, we still need to clarify how we achieved the normalization and the weight adjustment based on the error (also known as back-propagation).
            </p>

            <h5 id="normalization">Normalization</h5>

            <p>
            In a biologically inspired neural network, the output of a neuron is usually an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing in the cell. In its simplest form, this is binary value, i.e., either the neuron is firing or not. Hence, the need for normalization of this output value.
            </p>

            <p>
            To achieve this normalization we apply what is known as an activation function to the output of the neuron. If we take the example of a really simple Heaviside step function which assigns a 0 to any negative value and a 1 to any positive value, then a large number of neurons would be required to achieve the required granularity of slowly adjusting the weights to reach an acceptable consensus of the training set.
            </p>

            <p>
            As we will see in the next section on back-propagation, this concept of slowly adjusting the weights can be represented mathematically as the slope of the activation function. In biological terms, it can be thought of as the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. If we were to use a linear function instead of the Heaviside function, then we would find that the resulting network would have an unstable convergence because neuron inputs along favored paths would tend to increase without bound, as a linear function is not normalizable.
            </p>

            <p>
            All problems mentioned above can be handled by using a normalizable sigmoid activation function. One realistic model stays at zero until input current is received, at which point the firing frequency increases quickly at first, but gradually approaches an asymptote at 100% firing rate. Mathematically, this looks like:
            $$ \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            If plotted on a graph, the Sigmoid function draws an S shaped curve:
            </p>

            Thus, the final formula for the output of a neuron now becomes
            $$ Output = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\sum weight_i . input_i)}} $$
            </p>

            <p>
            There are other normalization functions that we can use but the sigmoid has the advantage of being fairly simple and also having a simple derivative which will be useful when we look at the back propagation below.
            </p>

            <h5 id="back-propagation">Back-propagation</h5>

            <p>
            During the training cycle, we adjusted the weights depending on the error. To do this, we can use the "Error weighted derivative" formula
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . SigmoidCurveGradient(output) $$
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason we use this formula is that firstly, we want to make the adjustment proportional to the size of the error. Secondly, we multiply by the input, which is either a 0 or a 1. If the input is 0, the weight isn’t adjusted. Finally, we multiply by the gradient of the Sigmoid curve (or the derivative).
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason that we use the gradient is because we are trying to minimize the loss. Specifically, we do this by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent method</a>. It basically means that from our current point in the parameter space (determined by the complete set of current weights), we want to go in a direction which will decrease the loss function. Visualize standing on a hillside and walking down the direction where the slope is steepest. The gradient descent method as applied to our neural net is illustrated as follows:
            </p><ol>
                <li>If the output of the neuron is a large positive or negative number, it signifies the neuron was quite confident one way or another.</li>
                <li>From the sigmoid plot, we can see that at large numbers the Sigmoid curve has a shallow gradient.</li>
                <li>Thus, if the neuron is confident that the existing weight is correct, it doesn’t want to adjust it very much and multiplying by the gradient of the sigmoid curve achieves this.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>
            The derivative of the sigmoid function is given by the following formula
            $$ SigmoidCurveGradient(output) = output . (1 - output) $$
            Substituting this back into the adjustment formula gives us
            $$ Adjustment = error . input . output . (1 - output) $$
            </p>

            <h5 id="code">Code</h5>

            <p>
            An important but subtle point that was missed out when explaining the mathematics above was that for each training iteration, the mathematical operations are done on the entire training set at the same time. Thus, we will make use of matrices to store the set of input vectors, the weights and the expected outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can grab the entire project source here: <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet">https://github.com/wheresvic/neuralnet</a>. For the sake of learning, we implemented all the math ourselves using only the standard java Math functions :)
            </p>

            <p>
            We will begin with the <code>NeuronLayer</code> class which is just a placeholder for the weights in our neural net implementation. We provide it with the number of inputs per neuron and the number of neurons which it can use to build a table of the weights. In our current example, this is very simply the last output neuron which has the 3 input neurons.
            </p>

<pre>public class NeuronLayer {

    public final Function<double, double=""> activationFunction, activationFunctionDerivative;

    double[][] weights;

    public NeuronLayer(int numberOfNeurons, int numberOfInputsPerNeuron) {
        weights = new double[numberOfInputsPerNeuron][numberOfNeurons];

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfInputsPerNeuron; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; numberOfNeurons; ++j) {
                weights[i][j] = (2 * Math.random()) - 1; // shift the range from 0-1 to -1 to 1
            }
        }

        activationFunction = NNMath::sigmoid;
        activationFunctionDerivative = NNMath::sigmoidDerivative;
    }

    public void adjustWeights(double[][] adjustment) {
        this.weights = NNMath.matrixAdd(weights, adjustment);
    }
}
</double,></pre>

            <p>
            Our neural net class is where all the action happens. It takes as a constructor the <code>NeuronLayer</code> and has 2 main functions:
            </p><ul>
                <li><code>think</code>: calculates the outputs of a given input set</li>
                <li><code>train</code>: runs the training loop <code>numberOfTrainingIterations</code> times (usually a high number like 10,000). Note that the training itself involves calculating the output and then adjusting the weights accordingly</li>
            </ul>
            

<pre>public class NeuralNetSimple {

    private final NeuronLayer layer1;
    private double[][] outputLayer1;

    public NeuralNetSimple(NeuronLayer layer1) {
        this.layer1 = layer1;
    }

    public void think(double[][] inputs) {
        outputLayer1 = apply(matrixMultiply(inputs, layer1.weights), layer1.activationFunction);
    }

    public void train(double[][] inputs, double[][] outputs, int numberOfTrainingIterations) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTrainingIterations; ++i) {

            // pass the training set through the network
            think(inputs);

            // adjust weights by error * input * output * (1 - output)

            double[][] errorLayer1 = matrixSubtract(outputs, outputLayer1);
            double[][] deltaLayer1 = …</pre></div></div>

<p>When your father suffers a heart attack and needs emergency surgery, who would you rather have operating on him?</p>



<p>An inspiring doctor who lost an arm in a tragic car accident, and still heroically manages to attain an average level of success as a surgeon?<br>Or the son of a multimillionaire who has breezed through life with minimal setbacks, and boasts one of the best surgical track records?</p>



<hr>



<p>There is a common perception that a meritocracy is the most fair way to run society. That because we are avoiding bias and favoritism and picking candidates purely based on their capabilities and achievements, a meritocratic system is the most fair of all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a belief is hogwash. There’s nothing “fair” about not selecting the surgeon who lost his arm in a car accident, and is now trying desperately to hold on to his career. There’s nothing fair about the fact that some people are born into good circumstances which confer a tremendous headstart in life. There’s nothing fair about the fact that so many of society’s most accomplished individuals grew up in upper-middle-class families that nurtured them, raised them well, and gave them access to highly regarded schools and teachers.</p>



<p>A meritocracy never was, and never will be, “fair”. <strong>And that’s the whole point.</strong></p>



<p>The reason meritocracies work so well, is not because they are fair, but because they produce peak performance.</p>



<p>NFL teams draft the “best” players they can find, because they know that’s how they can win the most games. Universities grant tenure to the most productive professors, because that will best enhance the University’s reputation, and further the frontiers of knowledge. Hospitals hire the best doctors, because they can save the most lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hiring people who are “good enough” is simply not good enough. There has never been, and never will be, a team that won the world cup by selecting players who are “good enough.” And what’s true for a kid’s game, is doubly true for our society. A society should delegate its jobs to those who are smartest, most capable, and most accomplished in that field. Because they are the ones who can best lead society through the worldly challenges we face everyday. Corrupting this process by discriminating on the basis of family ties, personal friendships, wealth, race, or gender, is simply cutting your nose to spite your face.</p>



<p>Which is not to say that “fairness” and Social Justice isn’t important. It is vital. But you don’t get to it by hiring less qualified candidates. By turning down the best possible candidate in favor of someone who is more sympathetic and “good enough”. A meritocracy excels at producing wealth and economic prosperity. Universal basic income, universal healthcare, unemployment insurance, better public schooling and free job trainings… these are the kind of Social Justice programs that can share the resulting prosperity among everyone.</p>



<p>Social justice teaches us how to distribute the pie fairly, so that no one is left behind. This is absolutely essential, and something we should always keep in mind. But social justice doesn’t have all the answers on how to grow the pie in the first place. And unless we harness the power of a meritocracy to keep the pie growing, we will all soon be fighting over scraps.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25485766" target="_blank"><em>Discussion thread on HackerNews</em></a></p>



<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: This article’s thesis is that we should select/hire candidates who will perform best in the role, regardless of their personal circumstances. Many have mentioned that traditional methods of assessment may be flawed, incomplete, or biased. In accordance with the thesis, we should certainly strive to refine our assessment methods, and continually make them more accurate. This article is certainly not stating that current methods of assessment are perfect.</em></p>



<p><em>Many have also brought up the point that personal circumstances often do impact job performance. For example, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/diversity-work-group-performance" target="_blank">some studies have suggested that diverse teams perform better than homogenous teams</a>, especially in certain job roles. If you are an ardent believer in improving team performance, this would mean taking into account any demographic info that would help the organization perform better. This is also a double-edged sword for a couple reasons:<br>1. By legalizing the use of race or gender as a factor in hiring decisions, you would also be enabling prejudiced employers who discriminate against women or minorities, for purely bigoted reasons<br>2. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/" target="_blank">Studies have also found that communities operate better in some ways, when they are more homogenous</a>. If more such studies are unearthed in future, the same reasoning above could be used to justify discriminating against all women and people of color. Something most of us, including myself, would consider to be dystopian.</em></p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Rack Server Mark I и Mark II have been working pretty nice for 6 month already. Both of them are based on a model which I found on <a href="https://thingiverse.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a> and inherited the basic design idea.</p>



<p>With Mark III, I completely rethought the design, which allowed to:</p>



<ul><li>increase the number of raspberries in 2 rack units</li><li>significantly reduce printing time and plastic consumption</li><li>significantly reduce the time required for assembling and disassembling the server</li><li>reduce the number of parts</li><li>implement a modular design, which means that MARK III will be available in various modifications</li></ul>



<p>I’m glad to present the first basic model, designed for 14x of Raspberry Pi and 14x of a standard 2.5″ SSD.</p>



<p>BTW I will be glad if you subscribe to my instagram <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/uptime.lab/" target="_blank">instagram.com/uptime.lab</a> your feedback and likes are very important for me!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>— Written by Triangles on December 13, 2020 
								• updated on December 19, 2020  
								• ID 86 —</p><p>An experimental Forward Iterator written from scratch to boost up hand-made containers.</p><div>
				
<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<p>An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.</p>
<p>Concretely, an iterator is a simple class that provides a bunch of operators: increment <code>++</code>, dereference <code>*</code> and few others which make it very similar to a pointer and the arithmetic operations you can perform on it. In fact, iterators are a generalization of pointers, which are often used as a foundation when writing the iterator itself.</p>
<p>Iterators are one of the building blocks of the Standard Library containers, but they are also useful when you want to provide the ability to iterate over elements of a custom container that you wrote yourself: this is what I want to investigate in the present article. Adding iterators to your containers will make them compatible with the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for">range-based for loops</a> and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">C++ Algorithms library</a>: a collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting and manipulating containers, based on iterators.</p>
<h2>A dummy container for our experiments</h2>
<p>Before digging deeper, let's define a silly custom container that we want to spice up with iterators:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
private:
    int m_data[200];
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integers</code> class is a wrapper around a raw array of <code>int</code>s: we want to be able to access elements of that private array through an iterator, as well as to loop over it or pass it to any of the Standard Library algorithms. Let's start by making some design decisions.</p>
<h2>Choose the nature of our iterator</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose the type of iterator we want to implement. Modern C++ defines six types:</p>
<table>

<p>The six categories are hierarchical: a Bidirectional Iterator is also a Forward Iterator and a Random Access Iterator is both a Bidirectional and a Forward Iterator and so on. Normally, all iterators are Input Iterators (1) which makes them read-only, also known as <strong>constant iterators</strong>. Iterators that both support read and write operations are also Output Iterators (2) and are called <strong>mutable iterators</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monocasual/internalpointers-files/master/2020/12/iterators/iterator-hierarchy.png" alt="Iterators hierarchy"></p><p>1. Iterators hierarchy in C++. All iterators are Input Iterators, Output Iterators or both.</p>
</div><p>Input and Output iterators are often used for low-level components such as input and output streams (the so-called <strong>single-pass algorithms</strong>) and thus have limitations. We want to do more with our custom container, so we will skip those two and jump straight to the mutable Forward Iterator.</p>
<h2>Prepare the custom iterator</h2>
<p>An iterator is usually declared inside the class it belongs to, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:
    struct Iterator { /* ... */ };

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by <em>tagging</em> it with the <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/"><strong>tag dispatch</strong></a> mechanism, while C++20 uses <strong>concepts</strong>: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.</p>
<p>C++ expects some properties from an iterator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterator_category</code> — one of the six iterator categories we have seen above. The full list is available <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags">here</a>. The <code>std::forward_iterator_tag</code> tag is what we need;</li>
<li><code>difference_type</code> — a signed integer type that can be used to identify distance between iterator steps. Our iterator is basically a wrapper around a pointer and leverages pointer arithmetic, so the default <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t"><code>std::ptrdiff_t</code></a> is a good choice;</li>
<li><code>value_type</code> — the type the iterator iterates over. <code>int</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>pointer</code> — defines a pointer to the type iterated over. <code>int*</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>reference</code> — defines a reference to the type iterated over. <code>int&amp;</code> in our case;</li>
</ul>
<p>Translated into code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iterator&gt; // For std::forward_iterator_tag
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;  // For std::ptrdiff_t

struct Iterator 
{
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using value_type        = int;
    using pointer           = int*;  // or also value_type*
    using reference         = int&amp;;  // or also value_type&amp;
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Why are tags useful?</h3>
<p>Some of the tags above might seem useless at first. In fact, you will notice how they will never get mentioned during the definition of our iterator. Tags are used to select the most efficient algorithm if your container is passed to one of the Standard Library functions from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library. Wrong tags mean sub-optimal performance! The iterator category is also used to set algorithm requirements, for example: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> wants a Forward Iterator, while <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse"><code>std::reverse</code></a> wants a Bidirectional Iterator. Passing the wrong iterator will result in a compilation error.</p>
<h2>Define the iterator constructors</h2>
<p>All iterators must be <em>constructible</em>, <em>copy-constructible</em>, <em>copy-assignable</em>, <em>destructible</em> and <em>swappable</em>. Let's translate those requirements into code for our iterator:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    Iterator(pointer ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Easy! We just need a custom constructor to initialize the private member variable <code>m_ptr</code>, which points to an element of the <code>Integers</code> container. The custom constructor satisfies the <em>constructible</em> requirement, while all others are covered by the implicitly-declared constructors and operators kindly provided by the compiler.</p>
<h2>Implement operators</h2>
<p>We are building a mutable Forward Iterator, which inherits properties from both Input and Output Iterators. The resulting iterator must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*iterator</code> and <code>iterator-&gt;x</code> — dereferenceable, to get the value it points to;</li>
<li><code>++iterator</code> and <code>iterator++</code> — incrementable, to move it one step forward, both prefix and postfix versions. The latter must return something dereferenceable;</li>
<li><code>iterator_a == iterator_b</code> and <code>iterator_a != iterator_b</code> — comparable with another iterator;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done by implementing some custom operators in the <code>Iterator</code> class, like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    // Iterator constructors here...

    reference operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
    pointer operator-&gt;() { return m_ptr; }

    // Prefix increment
    Iterator&amp; operator++() { m_ptr++; return *this; }  

    // Postfix increment
    Iterator operator++(int) { Iterator tmp = *this; ++(*this); return tmp; }

    friend bool operator== (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr == b.m_ptr; };
    friend bool operator!= (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr != b.m_ptr; };     

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see every operator involves the usage of the private pointer <code>m_ptr</code>. Also, notice the <code>friend</code> declaration for the two comparison operators: this is handy way to define the operators as non-member functions, yet being able to access private parts of the <code>Iterator</code> class (rationale  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/what-are-the-basic-rules-and-idioms-for-operator-overloading/4421729#4421729">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Prepare the container</h2>
<p>Our iterator is good to go. The last step is to give our custom container the ability to create <code>Iterator</code> objects. This is done by adding two public methods <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> that return instances of the <code>Iterator</code> class, representing the first and the last element respectively:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:

    // Iterator definition here ...

    Iterator begin() { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[0]); }
    Iterator end()   { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[200]); } // 200 is out of bounds
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>end()</code> method returns an iterator that refers to an <em>invalid</em> memory address, past the end of our raw array. Such iterator is just a placeholder used to determine when the boundary has been reached: it should never be accessed directly.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Time to test our iterator</h2>
<p>Both the custom container and its iterator are now ready. Let's test them with the range-based for loop:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;
for (auto i : integers)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>
<p>This code will magically print the value of each integer in the container. It works because the range-based for loop is just syntactic sugar created by the compiler for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (auto it = integers.begin(), end = integers.end(); it != end; ++it) { 
    const auto i = *it; 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>In words: two iterators <code>it</code> and <code>end</code> are created. The first one points to the beginning of the container, the other one points to the end. Then, on each loop, the <code>it</code> iterator is incremented until it's equal to <code>end</code>, that is until the end of the container has been reached. The actual value is obtained by dereferencing <code>it</code> in a local variable before being printed.</p>
<p>Notice how the compiler makes use of all the operators and functions we have previously implemented: the <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods in the custom container, the ability to compare the two iterators with the <code>!=</code> operator, the ability to increment <code>it</code> with the prefix syntax and finally the ability to dereference it to grab the actual value it points to.</p>
<p>Let's now try a function from the Algorithm library, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> for example:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;

std::fill(integers.begin(), integers.end(), 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The function assigns all elements in the container the value <code>3</code>. It works because <code>std::fill</code> is usually implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename ForwardIterator, …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While exploring D recently, I remembered a game I played while at university 15 years ago. For a long time, I couldn’t remember the name at all, only that it was from a Japanese developer. After some search wrangling, I finally managed to find the name of the game: <strong>Torus Trooper!</strong></p>
<p>You can find it there: <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tt_e.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a copy of the tt0_22.zip file archived: <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip">https://github.com/speps/tt/archive/legacy.zip</a></p>
<p>What made me remember this game is that :</p>
<ul>
<li>It came with <a href="https://github.com/speps/tt/tree/legacy/src/abagames">source code</a>, quite unusual at the time for me</li>
<li>Written in D, a language I didn’t know at all while I was busy studying C++</li>
<li>It’s awfully addictive!</li>
</ul>
<p>What better project than try to compile a <strong>D v0.110</strong> project in a modern version of D and possibly porting the game to WebAssembly+WebGL! So here we are…</p>
<h2 id="switching-from-ant-to-dub">Switching from Ant to DUB</h2>
<p>The game used Ant and its <code>build.xml</code> file to generate the executable, resources, etc. Since then, D added DUB as a build system / package manager so let’s use that!</p>

<p>Aside from always having a verb at the end, Japanese does not depend on sequence.  Japanese is a grammar defined by <em>grammar particles</em>, functional “words” that glue on to nouns to indicate what purpose the noun serves.</p>



<p>Here we highlight some common Japanese particles in a slice of the ひらがな [hiragana] syllabary.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1069" height="834" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/japanese-particles.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can practice your 🎵 listening comprehension👂 of the ひらがな 🎎 <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">here</a>.  But we digress, Japanese relies on <em>grammatical particles</em> to indicate the <strong>who, what, when,  where, and how</strong> of a sentence.</p>



<h2><strong>Who, what, when, where, and how</strong>.</h2>



<h2>で  (de) <strong>where and how</strong></h2>



<p>For example, で [“deh”] implies <em>manner of accomplishment</em> or <em>setting-locality where something takes place.</em> Mapping to English, we cover the <strong>where</strong> [setting] and <strong>how</strong> [means] with で。</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="246" height="142" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.34.24-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>に (ni) where and when</h2>



<p>For destinations, or specific times, or precise physical points of existence (being), Japanese relies on the use of the <em>grammatical particle</em> に [“ni” as in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIV4poUZAQo">“we are the knights who say…”</a>].  に [“knee!”] therefore covers <strong>where</strong> [destination] and <strong>when</strong> [moment].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="648" height="446" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.36.55-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<h2>が  (ga) who and what</h2>



<p>The <em>grammatical particle</em> が [“ga”] is used to explain <strong>who</strong> and <strong>what</strong> when used as the <strong>grammatical subjects</strong> of a sentence.  </p>



<p>For example: Vegetables are delicious.  Candy is sweet.<br>  (Veggies are <strong>what</strong> is delicious)<br>  (The candy is <strong>what</strong> is sweet)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="366" height="295" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.38.46-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally, in this brief primer, we want to show the concept of <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong> which we have featured on our <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">“Reverse Engineer Some Japanese”</a> page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="737" height="138" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.41.05-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Within a <strong>bunsetsu jar</strong>, we place a noun and cap off the <strong>jar</strong> with a <strong>lid</strong> containing a <em>grammatical particle</em> such as が、に、で or one of the many others.  </p>



<p>In total, there is an estimated 233 + particles (some are multi-mora, that is, multiple letters) and we teach them in a gradual and comprehensible way in <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=83">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, a sentence-final verb is placed at the end of a sentence.  In English, this would be akin to moving the “is/are” or “be/exists” verb to the end of every sentence.  Japanese fun is.  Grammar easy is.  Japanese-about thinking = interesting is.</p>



<p>So that’s it. You pick your nouns, you pick the <em>grammatical particles</em> to match based on the meaning of <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong>, and you figure out the sentence-final verb element.  Now you’re thinking in Japanese.</p>



<p>Of course, developing the reflex and intuition around this takes some practice, which is why we devised quizzes for Japanese Complete that help train your intuition on the particles, one-by-one.  You can watch a brief video showing some of the quizzes in action on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">free guide page</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Kanji in English Context</h2>



<p>In order to accelerate Kanji comprehension into English context, as you can see in a sonnet by Shakespeare on <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/learning-to-read">this page</a>.  This pattern follows a similar pattern of adoption that native Japanese took: grab kanji from mainland Asia for their ideographic value and smash them together with your native syllabary to add helpful meaning, nuance, and context.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="177" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-4.46.27-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Temple NI arrive.</strong> [unstated subjects arrive to the temple]</p>



<p><strong>Enter-before NI, hands OH let’s wash, NE.</strong> [before entering, let’s wash our hands, right?]</p>



<p>We’ve created a substack newsletter to share <em>Kanji in English Context </em>once or twice a month, you can <a href="https://japanesecomplete.substack.com/p/coming-soon">sign up for it here</a> if you’re interested in getting interesting <em>Kanji in English Context</em> lessons to your inbox.</p>



<hr>



<p>One great thing about Japanese grammar is that the <strong>bunsetsu jars</strong> can be arranged in any sequence before the final verb, provided each noun has its appropriately matching <em>grammar particle</em> glued on and intact.  This leads to great fun with parsing, as one can create a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=811">rudimentary Japanese grammar parser</a> from a 5-line EBNF grammar.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1349" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osaka-castle.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully this post made the inner mechanics of Japanese more clear.  Developing intuition and unlocking the language takes study, practice, and determination!  If you’re looking for a program to break the language down logically <strong>and</strong> provide practice and training to help your newfound understanding become intuitive and fast, might we humbly suggest <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve now worked with “The Cloud” for long enough to see that there’s still a long way to
go before it becomes materially better than, say, the oldschool method of renting a
couple of servers with a co-location company and running your software there. The
latest fad is Serverless, which makes me feel a lot like we’ve arrived in 1970.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, I was pretending to study business administration
while teaching myself to code in C. The university was in two worlds:
we had a lab with “personal computers” but also terminals to the mini
computer and assignments had to be made on either one depending on the
professors’ preferences. But both systems were at least “on-line” systems–interactive, with immediate feedback. A friend of mine was not so lucky:
he had an assignment for one of his courses in civil engineering that
had to be completed in Pascal and had to be handed in as a print-out
from the university’s mainframe.</p>

<p>He called me in for help, because he never wrote a line of code before. So I hopped
over to his place, a Turbo Pascal floppy disk in hand, and assumed that we would
make short work of the assignment. And we did, even though I never coded in Pascal
before: the IDE, even back then, was marvellous and a quick succession of trial-and-error
got us the results we wanted (they were some simple engineering calculations, much
quicker done on even the most primitive of calculators, but such are course assignments. At
least it was easy for us to verify the program was correct).</p>

<p>We hopped into the car and drove over the the university’s computer center, a ’70s brutalist
concrete bunker. We sat behind a terminal, typed in the code, surrounded it with the required
IBM Job Control Language that the teaching assistant helpfully added to the assignment, and
hit “Enter” (not “Return”, actually “Enter” - Enter The Job). A couple of minutes later, the
printer started and spit out a couple of pages. Between gibberish in all caps, there it was: a
compiler error. Back to square one - Turbo Pascal and IBM Mainframe Pascal clearly had some
differences. A couple of hours and reams of wasted paper later, we had what my friend wanted:
the results of a good run. The numbers matched our notes, and we could retreat to the nearest
bar for a well-earned beer.</p>

<p>Ever since that experience, I have stressed the value of feedback and especially of quick
feedback. Even in this minimal example, we spent more time tweaking the code for the dialect
than we spent on writing it in the first place. Slow feedback loops kill performance, and if
you don’t believe me, find an online version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">The Beer Distribution Game</a> and play it. You’ll be surprised.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of interactivity was, and still is, Smalltalk. I worked in that language for a
couple of years and having your system compile and run most of your tests in less than a second
is addictive. It is incredible how much your performance increases on a fully interactive
programming system but it takes first-hand experience to fully appreciate it. It’s a strange
system, a strange language, a tough sell; therefore Smalltalk is still in a very undeserved
state of limbo.</p>

<p>After my Smalltalk years, I met a lot of large Java systems. They started out as horrible
hairballs, but when the idea of “dependency injection” got a foothold, things started to get
better. Except for the return of the Job Control Language, this time disguised in XML and
carrying friendlier names like “Spring”. Internally, the code was reasonably clean and modular,
but telling the computer how to run it took pretty much the same amount of typing, this time
not in a programming language but in a structured markup language. That language lacked all
the facilities that apply to writing good code, so principles like “Don’t Repeat Yourself” went
overboard and copy/paste programming ensued. New business logic? New controller, twenty lines of
Java boilerplate, 10 lines of Java business logic, 50 lines of XML to wire it to the rest of
the system.</p>

<p>At least, in hindsight, XML was a blessing: your editor would tell you whether your “this is
how the code is wired up” description had the right structure, and later on even whether you
used names that existed in your Java codebase.</p>

<p>These systems took ages to compile, hours to run all the unit tests, and clearly interactivity
went down the drain. So “split it all up” was not a bad idea. It was an unnecessary idea, mostly
driven by the shortfalls of mainstream programming languages, but necessity is the mother of
invention - even though your average Java business app was much simpler than the Smalltalk
IDE before you added a single line of code to write your app, it was already too complex to
maintain and “divide and conquer” was the answer. Service Oriented Architecture, and later
microservices, was born. Split your codebase, split your teams, create a lot of opportunities
for mediocre coders to grow into mediocre engineering managers, everybody was happy. Including
your hardware vendor, because suddenly you needed much more hardware to run the same workloads. Because
networks are slow, and whereas it can be argued whether a three tier system is actually a distributed
computing system, a microservices system certainly qualifies for that label.</p>

<p>The return of the Job Control Language this time was in the form of,
again, configuration data on how to run your microservice. Microservices
were somewhat fatter than the very fine-grained objects of the old days,
so there was less of it, but still - it was there. The feedback cycle
became worse as well: in the monolith-with-XML days, your XML editor
would get you mostly there and a quick local compile and run would
leave you all but certain that your configuration was working.
XML, however, was universally rejected in favour of things like JSON, Yaml, HCL,
Toml - all free of structure, with zero indication whether a computer
would find your prose gibberish or the next Shakespeare play until
you actually pushed your code to some test cluster. It suddenly felt
a lot like being back at that university interacting with a mainframe,
but at least you still owned the hardware and could introspect all the
way down, especially if you were doing “DevOps” meaning mostly that you
had administrative access to your hardware.</p>

<p>Microservices have trouble scaling, and they are very complex. Most companies that employ them
have no need for them, but the systems and programming languages they employ are sufficiently
lacking that this stacking of complexity on top of complexity becomes a necessity. It seems that,
contrary to what everybody is saying, software developers are in plentiful and cheap supply so
wasting a lot of their talent makes economic sense over the perceived cost of adapting more
powerful programming systems. C’est la vie. The feedback cycle is truly broken - testing a
microservice is merely testing a cog in a machine and no guarantee that the cog will fit the
machine - but we just throw more bodies at the problem because Gartner tells us this is the future.</p>

<p>So, we’re now at the next phase of this game: maintaining these very complex systems is
hard and not your core business, so outsource it (simplifying it would cost too many managers’
jobs, so that is not an option). The Cloud was born, first as a marketing label for an old
business model (offering “virtual private servers” to the public), but more and more as a marketing
label for an even older business model (the mainframe - we run it, we own it, you lease capacity).</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse Is Better</a> and you can do worse than Virtual Private Servers, so through a short-lived detour through
containerizing microservices and deploying them on a distributed scheduler like Mesos, Nomad,
or Kubernetes, we have arrived at “Serverless”. You deploy individual stateless functions. But
not inside a Java monolith, that is old, but on top of a distributed system. You would have been
laughed out of the door if you had proposed that in 2000, and you should be laughed out of the
door right now, but such is the power of marketing. So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase,
because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment
descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called
“Function”, and instead
of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe. You
deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all
batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to
walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half
century. Oh, and a “Function”
will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed
a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew
can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.</p>

<p>History will repeat itself, of course. Conceptually, hiding a lot of the scaling and coordination
machinery is not a bad idea; programming systems like Erlang and OTP have shown for decades how
well that can work and Elixir is giving the platform a well-deserved surge in popularity. But there’s
a big difference here: a platform like OTP handles pretty much everything that a platform like
AWS Lambda handles, but it does it in a single programming language. Tools of the trade are
available: you can refactor Erlang code, you can write Elixir macros, all to keep the system
clean, malleable, and free of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>.</p>

<p>It is called “Configuration as Code”, and it truly is a great idea (but hardly a new one). But XML
is not code, and neither is JSON, nor YAML, nor HCL. There is an essential quality lacking in all
of these markup languages, and that causes all the copy/paste programming I am currently seeing
everywhere, whether a …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

VisUAL has been developed as a cross-platform tool to make learning ARM Assembly language easier. In addition to emulating <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/supported_instructions.html">a subset of the ARM UAL instruction set</a>, it provides visualisations of key concepts unique to assembly language programming and therefore helps make programming ARM assembly more accessible.

</p><p>It has been designed specifically to use as a teaching tool for the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/internal/curriculumee2">Introduction to Computer Architecture course</a> taught at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London.

</p>




<h2>Key Features</h2>



<h4>Navigate Program History</h4>

<p>In addition to stepping through code, users can navigate program history by browsing past register values. This feature can help debugging and understanding complex code easier.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/history_browsing.png" alt="history browsing"></p>



<h4>Pointer Visualisation</h4>

<p>Pointers in ARM assembly can be quite difficult to understand, especially since ARM assembly has 9 different variations of pointer behaviour when it comes to load/store instructions. VisUAL provides an information pane that displays useful pointer information when needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/pointer_visualisation.png" alt="pointer visualisation"></p>



<h4>Shift Operation Visualisation</h4>

<p>VisUAL can demonstrate shift operations by playing them as animations. The animations use actual data values from the shift instruction being demonstrated.</p>

<p><video width="100%" autoplay="" loop="">
  <source src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/shift_visualisation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video></p>



<h4>Memory Access Visualisation</h4>

<p>All memory access operations, word-aligned or byte-aligned,  can be visualised. Base and offset addresses are shown, and any values that have been changed are highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_visualisation.png" alt="memory visualisation"></p>



<h4>Stack Visualisation</h4>

<p>Instructions to load/store multiple instructions in the form of a stack can be visualised. Stack behaviour is described, and the stack as well as stack pointer at the start and end of the stack are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/stack_visualisation.png" alt="stack visualisation"></p>



<h4>Branch Visualisation</h4>

<p>Colour coded line highlights are used to indicate when a branch is being taken. For conditional instructions, status bits involved in condition checking are highlighted. An arrow points to the branch destination, acting as a visual cue to indicate a branch to another line of code is about to take place.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/branch_visualisation.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>



<h4>Subroutine Visualisation</h4>

<p>Whenever the link register is set to enter a subroutine, the linked subroutine return point will be highlighted and will remain highlighted until the subroutine exits.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/subroutine_visualisation.png" alt="subroutine visualisation"></p>



<h4>Error Correction Suggestions</h4>

<p>As opposed to providing cryptic compiler error messages, VisUAL provides context-specific error messages with explanations of exactly what is expected. In addition, whenever a runtime error occurs, the user is informed of the problematic instruction and what operation in the instruction resulted in the error.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/syntax_error.png" alt="syntax error"> <img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/runtime_error.png" alt="runtime error"></p>



<h4>Infinite Loop Detection</h4>

<p>Inadvertently typed code that may result in an infinite loop can cause code to malfunction. VisUAL detects possible infinte loops and prompts the user to select the appropriate response.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/infinite_loop_warning.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>

<h4>View Memory Contents</h4>

<p>By using the view memory contents window, data defined in memory can be monitored in real-time as it changes. This allows fast debugging of memory access instructions from a static viewpoint in addition to the dynamic viewpoint provided by the pointer and memory access visualisations.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_window.png" alt="memory contents window"></p>
    
<h4>View Symbols</h4>
    
<p>The symbols window provides a list of all code and data symbols that have been defined. This provides an easy method of lookup up symbols during execution.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/symbols_window.png" alt="view symbols window"></p>
    


<h4>Headless Emulation Mode</h4>

<p>VisUAL allows assembly code to be executed via the command line and logs the program state to an XML file. This is useful for power users for testing large batches of code. See the <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/logging_guide.html">logging guide</a> for details on how to use this.</p>

December 19, 2020 | https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google's products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that's not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it's a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don't actually use all of its features, but I've migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I'm really happy with it so far.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies that will host Nextcloud for you where you just sign up for an account like anything else, but in case you're interested in hosting Nextcloud for yourself this post is basically a brain dump of how I did that. It took me a while to cobble together all the pieces I needed to get everything working from end to end, so I'm hoping this might save someone else from having to do the same. If you know your way around servers and Nextcloud already you can just skim the headings like a checklist to make sure you don't forget an important step. But if you want a succinct overview of the actual steps I did and commands I ran, each section contains those details. By the end you'll see how I installed Nextcloud on my own server, secured it, set up backups, and set up external storage for my photos.</p>
<p>Some parts are pieced together from other partial guides or longer blog posts, so where relevant the references lead to those sources. This post is more of a quick start with just the essential steps. Anything in <code>&lt;pointy-brackets&gt;</code> is meant to be replaced. So the actual command I ran was e.g. <code>adduser kira</code>, not <code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>What this list assumes you already have</h2>
<ul>
<li>A domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.</li>
<li>An account with a cloud server provider. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com/choosing-linode/">Linode</a>.</li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a></li>
<li>Your ssh key</li>
<li>$75/year. I pay $5/month for the server I use, $5/year for the domain name ($5.16 actually), and CAD$10/year for carbon offsets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Set up a server running Ubuntu and set up ssh access for yourself</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spin up a new server with your cloud provider. I use a "nanode", the smallest server available from Linode, with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of storage, which is plenty more than <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/16/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server">Nextcloud's minimum specs</a>.</li>
<li>Select an operating system that can install <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">snap packages</a>. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS). Nextcloud recommends at least either Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.</li>
<li>Add your ssh key to the server. There should be a way to do this through the UI where you manage your new server.</li>
<li>Copy the IP address of your new server</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1. ssh into your server as the root user and make yourself a new sudo user that can also ssh into the machine <sup><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">1</a></sup></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ssh <a href="https://kiramclean.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="71031e1e0531">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>usermod -aG sudo &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>rsync --archive --chown=&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt; ~/.ssh /home/&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Close this ssh session and log in as your new user to make sure it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>logout</code></li>
<li><code>ssh &lt;name&gt;@&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave this ssh session open. The rest of the commands below are meant to be run on your server, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2>2. Point your new server to your custom domain</h2>
<p>There should be a way to do this in the admin section for your server. On Linode's there's a "Domains" section in the left admin menu. From there I clicked "Add a Domain" in the top right, then filled in the domain name, my email address, and selected "Insert default records from one of my Linodes" from the "Insert Defaults Records" dropdown, then I selected my new Nextcloud server from the list of Linodes. The steps might be slightly different depending what cloud server provider you're using. By the end you need DNS records pointing your domain name to your Nextcloud server. If you did this through Linode (or whatever you're using), you'll also need to update the nameservers with your domain registar.</p>
<h2>3. Set up a basic firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow OpenSSH</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow https</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow http</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Install Nextcloud</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo snap install nextcloud</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.manual-install &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Set up your domain, enable https, and install an auto-updating certificate from Let's Encrypt</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=&lt;your-domain.name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Enable 2FA on your Nextcloud account <sup>*</sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your new personal cloud at the domain you configured using the username and password you chose above and install the 2FA app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner of the Nextcloud dashboard and select "Apps"</li>
<li>In the left side bar click on "Security", then search for the "Two-Factor TOTP Provider" app</li>
<li>Click "Download and enable"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up 2FA with this newly installed app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner and select "Settings"</li>
<li>In the left sidebar, click on "Security" (in the "Personal" section) then check the "Enable TOTP" box and follow the instructions to set up 2FA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to forget my password in the time between installing Nextcloud and trying to log in for the first time. If that happens to you, you can reset it by running <code>sudo nextcloud.occ user:resetpassword &lt;username&gt;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>* Doing this means you will be required to generate "app passwords" in order to log in to your Nextcloud account in third party apps or other devices (to use Nextcloud to sync your calendar or reminders to your phone, for example.) There's a tiny box with a button that says "Create new app password" at the bottom of the "Security" admin section (under "Personal", not "Administration") where you can do that.</small></p>
<h2>7. Set up backups</h2>
<h3>7.1. Turn on "local" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable backups for your whole server for a first layer of backups. I did this when I was setting up my Linode (there was a checkbox in the "Optional Add-ons" section for it). Otherwise there's a "Backups" tab in the admin section where you can turn them on. Linode charges $2/months for this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7.2. Set up "offsite" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install and set up Backblaze</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bucket in Backblaze for your backups</li>
<li>Make an app key with access to your backup bucket</li>
<li>Get the Backblaze cli and configure it
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pip3 install b2</code></li>
<li><code>sudo b2 authorize_account &lt;keyID&gt;</code></li>
<li>Copy the key secret from the app key you just made to authorize the Backblaze cli</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new user to run the backups and disable password access for it, for security <sup><a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-backup-nextcloud/">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo adduser ncbackup</code></li>
<li><code>sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin ncbackup</code> <sup>*</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create directories for the backups and logs</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo mkdir -p /home/ncbackup/backups/logs</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the backup script and make it runnable <sup>**</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo touch /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo vim /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code> and copy the contents of the backup script below into your new file, or write your own that accomplishes the same things: <sup>***</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -e

DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

# Output to a logfile
exec &amp;&gt; /home/ncbackup/backups/logs/${DATE}.txt

# Export all your config and data from Nextcloud
echo "Starting Nextcloud export..."
nextcloud.export
echo "Export complete"

# Compress backed up folder
echo "Compressing backup..."
tar -zcf /home/ncbackup/backups/${DATE}.tar.gz -C /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/ .
echo "Nextcloud backup successfully compressed to /home/ncbackup/backups"

# Remove uncompressed backup data
rm -rf /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/*

# Remove backups and logs older than 5 days
echo "Removing backups older than 5 days..."
find /home/ncbackup/backups -type f -mtime +5 -delete
find /home/ncbackup/backups/logs -type f -mtime +5 -delete

# Keep 14 days of backups in Backblaze
echo "Uploading to Backblaze..."
b2 sync --keepDays 14 --replaceNewer /home/ncbackup/backups b2://&lt;your-bucket-name&gt;
echo "Nextcloud backup completed successfully"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let the <code>ncbackup</code> user run the backup script as the root user
<ul>
<li><code>sudo visudo</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the end of the file that opens:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Allow ncbackup to run script as sudo
ncbackup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>
<small>
* If you want to undo this for some reason you can run <code>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash ncbackup</code>
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
** Note this means you will have 6 copies of all your data on your server all the time -- 5 backups and the live versions. The backups are compressed, but it can still add up to a lot of space. Keep an eye on how much storage your server is using. Running it out of space will probably be one of the first issues you run into. I explain how to get notified when that's close to happening at the end.
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
*** You don't have to use vim here. Your server probably has nano installed or you can install the editor of your choice. To change the default editor on your server, run <code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>, and choose the one you want.
</small>
</p>
<h2>8. Schedule and monitor your backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make yourself a healthcheck at <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> and copy the ping url</li>
<li><code>sudo crontab -u ncbackup -e</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the bottom of the file: <code>0 2 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh &amp;&amp; curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 -o /dev/null &lt;your-ping-url&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will run your backups once per day at 2am (in your server's timezone, probably UTC), but you can set whatever time and frequency you want, just remember to update your healthcheck to match.</p>
<h2>9. Test your backups</h2>
<p>Backups are only useful if you can use them to restore your data. Make sure yours work before you need them.</p>
<p>To test your entire server backups you can just try restoring the whole server using Linode's (or whoever's) UI. Testing the archived backups we uploaded to Backblaze is a little more involved but you'll be glad you know how to do it when you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat steps 1-5, except you can just update the records for your domain that's already set up to point to your new server's IP address(es).</li>
<li>Download one of your backups</li>
<li>Copy the backup onto your new server. Run this in a terminal on your machine (not in an ssh session with a remote server):
<ul>
<li><code>scp /local/path/to/your/backup/ &lt;user&gt;@&lt;new-server-ip-address&gt;:~</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>ssh into your new server for the rest of these commands</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip, rename, and move the backup to a place where the Nextcloud snap installation will be able to access it, then make the root user the owner
<ul>
<li><code>tar -xvzf &lt;backup-name&gt;.tar.gz</code></li>
<li><code>sudo mv &lt;backup-data-dir&gt;/ …</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

	<p>The emulation is running various versions of the original game, both from binaries copies of the original paper tapes and newly assembled from authentic code listings. The programs are loaded as virtual paper tapes (RIM-mode: Read In Memory) into the memory of the emulated DEC PDP-1.</p>

Finally, there is a special version of Spacewar 3.1, demonstrating the "Winds of Space" effect.</p>

		<li id="spacewar3.1"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong> <span>(24 Sep 1962)</span><br>This could be regarded as the "standard version" of Spacewar!. The program is dated <em>"24 sep 62"</em> and is loaded from an authentic binary paper-tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">spacewar3.1_24-sep-62.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1bigships');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1, scaled ships</strong> <span>(low resolution only)</span><br>Scaled up graphics and effects to show the game in greater detail on a small display. (Colission radii and turning pivots of the ships have been adjusted accordingly.) This is quite similar to the presentation seen in other emulations. Please mind that the changes have minor effects on the gameplay.<br>
		The code is based on the original PDP-1 <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/_text/" target="_blank" title="Text-files in the archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">assembler sources</a> by Steve Russell as available at <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a> and was modified and newly assembled in 2014. (N. Landsteiner, 2014; this is not an authentic version!)</li>

		<li id="spacewar2b"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> <span>(2 Apr 1962)</span><br>This is the first complete version version of the game as presented at MIT's annual <em>Science Open House</em> in May 1962. Notably this is also the very version the background starfield (Peter Samson's <em>Expensive Planetarium</em>) was designed for, as this is annotated in the source code by <em>"stars by prs for s/w 2b"</em> and dated <em>"3/13/62, prs".</em> The program features the pre-particle-system "Crock Explosion" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-5" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig5.jpeg', 417, 422);} else { return true;}">[4]</a> and optionally a faster movement of the starfield (sense switch 4), torpedoes are single shot only (no salvoes). Some of the differences are more cosmetical: The ships' exhaust flames are half the size of later versions, also the display of the starfield hasn't found its final form yet (starting at an other position as compared to later versions). Moreover, the original starfield routine, found here, is modulating the varying brightnesses of the stars by how often the individual stars are drawn, whereas later versions are using the built-in intensity levels of the <em>Type 30 CRT</em> display instead.<br>For more on the making-of of Spacewar! see <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar" by J. M. Graetz</a>.<br>
		<span></span>The code is run from a binary paper tape image (RIM) labeled "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank" title="&quot;spaceWar_SA-5.bin&quot; in &quot;InsidePDP1_80s_box3&quot; at textfiles.com">spaceWar_SA-5.bin</a>". This has been proven to be identical to loading the two paper tapes "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20050823/" target="_blank" title="'spacewar2B_2apr62.bin' at textfiles.com">spacewar2B_2apr62.bin</a>" and "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="'stars.bin' at textfiles.com">stars.bin</a>", both to be found at bitsavers.org.<br>
		(<em>"SA-5"</em> is not a version string, but indicates the program's start address being 5, which would start the program in a setup for reading the input from the console test switches rather than from MIT's special control boxes, as would be the case with the default start address. The label suggests that this was a tape sent from MIT to an other facility.)<br>
		Spacewar! 2B is known with a date as early as 25 March 1962. This earlier version shows minor differences regarding the polarity of the sense switch settings.<br>
		<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/spacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.png" alt="Spacewar! — The Hyperspace Minskytron signature" title="The Minskytron signature effected by &quot;warp-induced photonic stress emission&quot;" width="75" height="105">
		<span></span>The program is presented here with two patches applied, namely the hyperspace-patch to include Martin Graetz's original hyperspace routine, the "<strong><a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/inside/insidespacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.html" target="_blank">Minskytron hyperspace</a></strong>" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-4" target="_blank" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig4.jpeg', 419, 416);} else {return true;}">[5]</a> and its <em>"warp-induced photonic stress emission",</em> and the auto-restart patch for seemless playing. (There are exactly three jumps to hyperspace per player.)<br>
		This represents the the game as described and depicted in J.M. Graetz's seminal article <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> and as presented at the <em>MIT Science Open House</em> in May 1962. (It still lacks a scorer-patch, which seems to be lost.)
		The patches are provided by the paper tape images "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">hyperspace85.bin</a>" <em>(Hyperspace VIci, 2 May 1962)</em> and  "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20030408/" target="_blank">spaceWarRstrt.bin</a>" — an other tape provides the same patch as "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">spacewAutoRestartPatch.bin</a>". (The auto-restart patch was to be applied to the hyperspace-patch and is by this officially a patch to a patch. Thus, loading the full program had become a fairly complex affair then, involving up to 6 tapes.)<br>
		<span></span>Listings of Spacewar! 2B and the patches may be found <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/sources/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
		<span></span>Please mind that this is still the game early in development. The restart-patch is missing an edge case (pun in­tend­ed), where the ships would collide at the "antipode" in the corners of the display. The game requires a manual restart in this situation.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1f"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1f</strong> <span>(20 Feb 1963; mod. for CHM 2005 – 2008)</span><br>This is the version apparently running at the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> (CHM).<br>This is Spacewar! 4.1 modified by <strong>Peter Samson</strong> in 2005–2008 to include the <strong>scorer routine of Spacewar! 4.8</strong>. Moreover, version 4.1f features modified brightness settings for the background starfield (for use at the CHM), which are here remapped to usual values by the emulator. (Otherwise most of the stars would remain invisible.) Like other version of Spacewar! 4.x it requires the hardware multiply/divide option and features the single shot switch for torpedoes. The source code is dated <em>"spacewar 4.1  2/20/63 dfw"</em> and annotated <em>"mod for CHM, 2005-06-01 - 2005-11-28  --prs",</em> and <em>"changed delay in score display, 2008-08-22  --prs.".</em> The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/from_peter_samson/" target="_blank" title="Archive PDP-1 codes provided by Peter Samson at textfiles.com">sw41f.rim</a>) provided by Peter Samson via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.2"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.2a');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.2a (4.1/4.2 dfw)</strong> <span>(22 Feb 1963 ?)</span><br>This is an authentic representative of the 4.x-generation of Spacewar! (probably by "dfw", like version 4.1 above), requiring the hardware multiply/divide option of the PDP-1. Additionaly to some internal modifications it features, like all versions 4, a working single shot mode for torpedoes (sense switch 3). The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040106/russell2/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #2 at textfiles.com">spacewar4.2a_sa4.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.<br>A visually distinctive detail of versions 4.x (4.1 and later) is the <em>"Sun"</em> (heavy star), now drawn by a dashed line like the rocket blasts, thus separating it visually a bit more from the starships (see the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/fullscreen.html#version=4.2a" title="Full-scale version of Spacewar! 4.2 emulated in HTML5/Javascript">high-res/full-scale version</a> for a close-up view.) Also, two ships colliding in free fall in the center will explode at the <em>"antipode"</em> rather than at the center as with earlier versions of the game.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.3"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.3');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.3</strong> <span>(17 May 1963)</span><br>This is a version by Monty Preonas (signing <em>"ddp"</em>), who also provided the adaptations for the automatic hardware multiply/divide option and the new gravity computations used by all flavors of Spacewar! 4 in his version 4.0 <em>(2 Feb 1962)</em> earlier.<br>
		Spacewar! 4.3 features, like Monty Preonas' flavor of version 4.2 and version 4.4 (also signed <em>"ddp",</em> but presumably by Joe Morris), a special <strong>on-screen score display</strong>, very much like the one of the 4.8-scorer-patch (see the note on scores below). Like all versions by Monty Preonas, it usues an implementation of the background starfield alike the one of Spacewar! 2B.<br>
		The game features a special <strong>Twin Star mode</strong> to be engaged by sense-switch 2 (accessible by the <em>options menu</em> <img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/menubutton_small.png" width="20" height="16" alt="options menu icon" title="options menu icon"> at the top right corner of the screen). This visually distorted mode puts the <em>Needle</em> in the center of the screen in between a doubled sun and draws any other objects relatively to this ship. Moreover, some items are drawn at a double offset and torpedoes are displaced for real, resulting in a quite vexing game play. This mode was probably initially intended as an <em>ego view</em> from the <em>Needle's</em> perspective and left <em>as-is</em> as an amazing novelty. (Compare "Spacewar! 2015" below.)<br>
		<span></span>The program, dated <em>"5/17/63",</em> was newly assembled from source code provided in the assorted listings available at <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102664173" target="_blank" title="'Stars by prs for s/w 2b', CHM, catalog no. 102664173">CHM catalog no. 102664173</a> (which apparently came from Joe Morris, compare <cite><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.sys.pdp10/cNG89mmlbK0/V0JPyn3Mg7sJ" target="_blank">Joe Morris, alt.sys.pdp10, Jannuary 6, 2005</a></cite>).</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.8"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.8');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.8</strong> <span>(24 Jul 1963)</span><br>Apparently the final version of MIT-Spacewar!, dated <em>"7/24/63"</em> and signed <em>"dfw"</em>. A patch for a special <strong>on-screen scorer</strong> is available for this version (see the note on scoring below).<br>
		The game was newly assembled including the dedicated scorer patch. Sources <em>("spacewar4.8part1_engl.txt", "spacewar4.8part2_engl.txt", and "spacewar4.8_scorer.txt")</em> are available at <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040817/" target="_blank" title="Spacewar 4.8! sources and sorer-patch at textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1hafb"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1hafb');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1 Holloman Air Force Base Version</strong><br>This is a reconstruction of a version of PDP-1 Spacewar! as seen at the Holloman Air Force Base (New Mexico) and described by John W. Andrews in December 1966 for "The Gamesman" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Gamesman_4-1967-12/page/n31" target="_blank" title="Archived copy of The Gamesman, issue 4, Dec. 1967 (archive.org)">The Gamesman, Issue 4, Dec 1967, pp 30-32</a>).

And as pressure rose, to whom did the Sacklers turn to vouch for them?</p><p>The museums that had taken their philanthropy.</p><p>The Ink has seen a tranche of the Sacklers’ WhatsApp group chats as members of the family sought to cope with and strategize about their fall from grace and growing legal risk. They were quietly released as part of an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, thanks to <a href="https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/purduepharma/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTEzMTYxMQ==&amp;id2=0">demands by multiple news organizations</a>. A source provided them to The Ink, which is the first publication to report on them. (To assist better-resourced follow-up reporting, The Ink will now offer to collaborate with larger news organizations.)</p><p>The messages show how, in the plutocratic echelons, it is assumed that philanthropic gifts made in sunny times can buy you public support from prestigious institutions on a rainy day. They show how a family that could no longer deny the scale of pain and death in the country tended to view the problem primarily through the prism of public relations, their anger concentrated on the difficulty of crafting statements, not curbing the hurt. And the messages show how a profound sense of victimhood descended on some members of the family, perhaps blinding them to the need to address the problem in the way one relative suggested: at a cost to their bottom line.</p><p>“We are the most vulnerable of the opponents (as we are a private family owned business) and in their view the easiest prey to get lots of money from!,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Mortimer Sackler</a>, son of a deceased family patriarch by the same name, texted the group in 2018, fretting about legal cases.</p><p>Two years later, the walls have closed in further.

Or were you thinking fancy adult thing?” wrote Jeffrey Lefcourt, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/fashion/weddings/06hitchcock.html">family member</a> and <a href="https://ctrnyc.com/about/">proprietor</a> of the popular New York City restaurant brand The Smith.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:48,&quot;bytes&quot;:71098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>But as pressure against the Sacklers ratcheted up, the texts turned serious. And the reflex for managing it came naturally: let’s hit up those to whom we’ve given back.</p><p>For example, in November 2016, the Dia Art Foundation in New York had announced, according to <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/dia-art-foundation-creates-sackler-institute-focused-on-programming-research-and-education-with-generous-gift-7226/">a report in ARTnews</a>, that “following a gift from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, it has created the Sackler Institute, which a release describes as ‘a center without walls.’” In years past, the Sacklers had given similar gifts to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/21/tate-art-galleries-will-no-longer-accept-donations-from-the-sackler-family">Tate</a> group of British galleries, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/10/v-and-a-boss-tristram-hunt-sacklers-family-funding">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/nan-goldin-leads-a-protest-at-the-guggenheim-against-the-sackler-family">the Guggenheim</a> and <a href="http://www.sackler.org/sackler-wing-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-ny/">the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/sackler-educational-laboratory">the American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York.</p><p>Well, to quote the title of <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2344-no-such-thing-as-a-free-gift">a book by Linsey McGoey</a>, there is “no such thing as a free gift.”</p><p>In late October 2017, Marissa Sackler texted the family: “I just spoke to head of communications at dia. They and many other art institutions plus bio medical schools have been reached out to by the New York Times. / Dia shares pr representation with the tate and a number of other art institutes who’ve been contacted. They are all planning to give short positive statements about us being supporters of theirs. / They expect the article to come out in the next week.”</p><p>She was wrong only about timing. On December 1, 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/arts/design/sackler-museum-donations-oxycontin-purdue-pharma.html">a report in The New York Times</a> showed how there is no silencer as effective as money. “The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinRMoynihan">Colin Moynihan</a> wrote, adding: “None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future.”</p><p>Another message — sent to the group chat by <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/sackler-scandal">Samantha Sackler Hunt</a> — suggested that emails sent by reporters to cultural institutions, asking about Sackler gifts, were being relayed back to the family, apparently via the public-relations firm Edelman:</p><blockquote><p>From Edelman</p><p>Hi all</p><p>I just wanted to keep you in the loop that a reporter from The Times (London) has also been emailing various cultural institutions that have benefitted from Sackler Family philanthropy. It seems as though she is doing a very similar exercise to the reporter from the New York Times that you have already been made aware of. Below is the request that got sent through to the V&amp;A. She appears to be sending versions of this to a number of others. From what I’ve seen so far most are responding with the same types of generic statements they gave the New York Times and all appear supportive. Georgie Keate, the reporter in question, is a general home news reporter and joined The Times in 2014 as a graduate trainee so is still relatively junior. This could indicate that it may not be a large story for them or she may be doing the spade work for someone else. We will make Josie aware.</p><p>[The reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiekeate">Georgie Keate</a>’s email supposedly begins here]</p><blockquote><p><em>I am doing a story on the Sackler family and their family fortune - which derives from the extremely controversial drug Oxycontin which their company Purdue Pharma is accused of marketing falsely by claiming it was safe and non-addictive. They have faced thousands of lawsuits and paid out tens of millions over the last decade over their aggressive marketing campaigns and refusal to take responsibility for the fact the drug is dangerous. Having been held to account in America, the family continue to push it in developing countries.</em></p><p><em>Obviously, the family has donated to scores of theatres, museums and colleges across the UK while keeping their connection to Purdue and Oxycontin completely secret.</em></p><p><em>Many people who are becoming aware of this are astonished and question whether the art world should be so heavily funded by a family who have been involved in such serious wrongdoing. Some have compared it to the 100s of notables who petitioned to have BP removed from the Tate. The V&amp;A is obviously one of these beneficiaries - would you be able to comment for an article?</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Some months later, in March 2018, the family could continue to feel that museums were on their team. Mortimer WhatsApped the family: “Jackie spoke with the Met this morning and they are going to stand by us.”</p><p>Referring to the protests led by the artist Nan Goldin that were moving public opinion against the Sacklers, Mortimer wrote: “Better that the company use her protests as an opportunity to speak to the industry leading work they have been doing to combat prescription drug abuse. What we SHOULD do is make sure that the Guggenheim, AMNH, DIA, etc are not going to say something unhelpful. We should compile a list of organizations and decide who should speak with which.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Marissa Sackler</a> volunteered: “I speak regularly with dia on all of this and they fully support us and think Nan Goldin is crazy.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Ilene Sackler Lefcourt</a> chimed in: “I am reaching out to the AMNH through the chairman of the board’s best friend.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the following year, a growing number of institutions began to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">change their minds</a>, declaring that they would no longer take Sackler money and, in some cases, removing the Sackler name from their facilities. The institutions included the Met, the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, the American Museum of Natural History, New York University, and Tufts.</p><p>When one of the announcements came, the first words about it in the group chat, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Sophie Sackler</a>, were: “Did anyone know this was happening?”</p><p>And alarm grew as even that most mercenary of sectors — banking — seemed to turn its back on Purdue. “Does anyone know why <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-jp-morgan-exclusive/exclusive-jpmorgan-cuts-ties-with-oxycontin-maker-purdue-pharma-sources-idUSKCN1ST2EA">JPM is not doing Purdue banking</a>?” Jeffrey Lefcourt texted the family on May 24, 2019, just days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">a wave of museum disavowals</a>, apparently referring to the banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase. “What’s their reason? Any concern they will stop doing banking for family? Have any of you spoken to them?”</p><p>Mortimer responded: “They told Purdue it was for ‘reputation’ reasons but that they were (so far) limiting it only to Purdue and not to the family.”</p><p>The timing suggests, though hardly proves, that the museums’ abrupt reversal on support for the family coincided with problems closer to the core of their business operations. Which raises the question of whether the arts institutions’ years of silence helped a machinery of death …</p></div></div>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.3, and thanks to <strong>66</strong> contributors, <strong>178</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="wasm-webgl2">WASM + WebGL2</h2>

<p>Bevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy_webgl2">Bevy WebGL2 Plugin</a> and expanding <code>bevy_render</code> to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web. </p>
<p>I think the results speak for themselves:</p>
<h3 id="bevy-webgl2-showcase"><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/">Bevy WebGL2 Showcase</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/"><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-4/webgl_showcase.png" alt="webgl2 showcase"></a></p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-main-function">Cross Platform Main Function</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>On most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> adds a new <code>#[bevy_main]</code> proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our "write once run anywhere" goal.</p>
<p>This Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

#[</span><span>bevy_main</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="live-shader-reloading">Live Shader Reloading</h2>
<p>authors: @yrns</p>
<p>Bevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!</p>

<h2 id="ecs-improvements">ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!</p>
<h3 id="flexible-ecs-parameters">Flexible ECS Parameters</h3>
<p>Prior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected
</span><span>fn </span><span>valid_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) {
}

</span><span>/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail
</span><span>fn </span><span>invalid_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Newbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The <code>IntoSystem</code> trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/9afe196f1690a6a6e47bf67ac740b4edeffd97bd/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/into_system.rs#L158">famously complicated macro</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a <code>SystemParam</code> trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly Faster Compile Times</strong>: We're seeing a <b>~25%</b> decrease in clean compile times</li>
<li><strong>Use Any Parameter Order You Want</strong>: No more arbitrary order restrictions!</li>
<li><strong>Easily Add New Parameters</strong>: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the <code>SystemParam</code> trait!</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Implementation</strong>: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>commands</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that in <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, commands now look like <code>commands: &amp;mut Commands</code> instead of <code>mut commands: Commands</code>. </p>
<h3 id="simplified-query-filters">Simplified Query Filters</h3>
<p>Up until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B, </span><span>(&amp;</span><span>Transform, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Confused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as "give me immutable references to the <code>Transform</code> and <code>Velocity</code> components of all entities that have the <code>A</code> component, <em>do not</em> have the <code>B</code> component, and have a changed Velocity component".</p>
<p>First, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?</p>
<p>It made sense to break up these concepts. In <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Query with filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, </span><span>(</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;) {
}

</span><span>// Query without filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> without actually retrieving the <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>And now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:</p>
<pre><code><span>type </span><span>ChangedVelocity </span><span>= (</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;);

</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, ChangedVelocity</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="system-inputs-outputs-and-chaining">System Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining</h3>
<p>Systems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
  </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
    .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>result_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>().</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span><span>error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>()))
    .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>result_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt; {
  </span><span>let</span><span> transform </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>SOME_ENTITY</span><span>)?;
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>found entity transform: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>);
  </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>error_handler_system</span><span>(</span><span>In</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>: In</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>error_handler</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyErrorHandler</span><span>&gt;) {
  </span><span>if let </span><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>) =</span><span> result </span><span>{
</span><span>      error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_error</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>);
  }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.System.html"><code>System</code>
</a> trait now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Has no inputs and no outputs
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>()</span><span>, Out = </span><span>()&gt;

</span><span>// Takes a usize as input and return a f32
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>usize</span><span>, Out = </span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-v2">Schedule V2</h3>
<p>Bevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one Schedule allowed</li>
<li>Very static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:
<ul>
<li>stages are just lists of systems</li>
<li>stages are added to schedules</li>
<li>stages use hard-coded system runners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Couldn't switch between schedules at runtime</li>
<li>Couldn't easily support "fixed timestep" scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely <em>non-breaking</em> changes. The high level "app builder" syntax you know and love is still available:</p>
<pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-trait">Stage Trait</h4>
<p>Stages are now a trait. You can now implement your own <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> types!</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyStage</span><span>;

</span><span>impl </span><span>Stage </span><span>for </span><span>MyStage </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>world</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> World, </span><span>resources</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Resources</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// Do stage stuff here.
        // You have unique access to the World and Resources, so you are free to do anything
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-type-systemstage">Stage Type: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.SystemStage.html"><code>SystemStage</code></a></h4>
<p>This is basically a "normal" stage. You can add systems to it and you can decide how those systems will be executed (parallel, serial, or custom logic)</p>
<pre><code><span>// runs systems in parallel (using the default parallel executor)
</span><span>let</span><span> parallel_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// runs systems serially (in registration order)
</span><span>let</span><span> serial_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>serial</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// you can also write your own custom SystemStageExecutor
</span><span>let</span><span> custom_executor_stage </span><span>=

It’s … different, anyhow</em></p><p><a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-aws-proton-service">AWS Proton</a> launched in preview last week to great fanfare and even greater confusion.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there is one thing that unites the AWS Hero Slack right now, it's that all of us are a little bit confused about what Proton is. We want to like it! But, like … what is it?</p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333887600592121858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>“Automated management for container and serverless deployments,” <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/proton/">says AWS marketing</a>. So this is a tool specifically for deploying serverless apps, like <a href="https://stackery.io/">Stackery</a> or Amplify? Nope! I think the reason they’re advertising Proton as a solution for “containers and serverless” is that the two provided sample template bundles are for a Lambda CRUD app and a load-balanced Fargate service. But while building your own templates appears to be <em>frustrating, </em>there’s no technical <em>limit</em> on the sorts of apps Proton could help you deploy.</p><p>Proton itself is “serverless” only in the way CloudFormation is serverless: it’s a managed service. So is Proton a new and improved CloudFormation? No, it uses <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-templates">CloudFormation templates all marked up with Jinja</a>, but it operates at a higher level than that.</p><p>It took a while to click for me, but Proton is not just another half-baked AWS developer tool. It’s doing something I don’t believe AWS has ever attempted before.</p><p>Proton’s innovation is that it builds <em>explicit assumptions about your organization</em> into its technical design.</p><p>Proton is <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1334321228694380544">Conway’s Law-as-a-Service</a>.</p><h2 id="h-proton-assumes-a-platform-team">Proton assumes a platform team</h2><p>I’ve spoken a lot over the years about the phenomenon (and, increasingly, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/08/07/cloud-bard-forrest-brazeal-pinpoints-failure-celebrates-success-cloud-native-evolution/">the pathologies</a>) of the central cloud team: the Terraform nerds at the center of a cloud-first org who create tools and standards for everybody else, particularly product developers. In your company, this team might be called the “platform team”, the “infrastructure team”, or just the “cloud team”. It’s a remarkably consistent pattern across larger orgs, even if it’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">ultimately sub-optimal</a>.</p><p>In fact, the “one platform team supporting many product dev teams” pattern is so prevalent that AWS, in true customer-obsession mode, has now reasoned backwards from it to design Proton. Proton is a prescriptive way for platform teams to package up environments and infrastructure services, then toss them over the wall to development teams who will consume them. Proton draws the line between automation of infrastructure and development of application code exactly where your average enterprise does.</p><p>This means that if you do NOT have a central platform team and multiple dev teams — say, if you are a 10-person startup — <em>Proton is not for you, </em>at least not now, even if you have many Containers and Serverless Apps to deploy<em>. </em>Not for the reason many AWS services will not be for you — because they solve a technical problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford — but because Proton solves the app deployment problem in a way that is <em>incompatible with your organizational structure.</em></p><p>I really can’t think of another AWS service that is built this way. Even services like CodePipeline that ship AWS’s own organizational philosophy — I’m thinking of its reluctance to support branch-based workflows — do so implicitly and with workarounds. Proton is made for enterprise-shaped orgs. Period.</p><p>And that’s not a criticism! AWS absolutely should be releasing services designed with specific customer workflows in mind. Heck, I’ve <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/serverless-cicd-for-enterprise/">personally implemented</a> at least three bespoke versions of AWS Proton over the years, and so have many, many other people who’ve worked on central cloud teams. The hard part was always the separation of duties between what the central team should do and what the development teams should do, and how to get buy-in on that line of separation, wherever you end up drawing it. I even wrote up a janky Service Catalog-y solution in <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">this 2019 piece</a>, which reads in retrospect like a cry for help.</p><p>Proton is <em>prescriptive</em> in the sense that it gives you a pre-baked pattern for coordinating application delivery, but <em>descriptive </em>in the sense that this pattern wasn’t dreamed up as an arbitrary “best practice” – it’s simply a canonization of what AWS sees customers already doing. In this way, it reminds me more of the reference architectures we often see open-sourced by AWS solutions architects and partners, rather than a typical top-level service.</p><h2 id="h-but-is-proton-a-good-idea">But is Proton a good idea?</h2><p>Proton’s been released in preview and is not fully baked yet, so I won’t offer specific technical nitpicks here, but I’d like to address a criticism that I’ve already heard quite a bit from central cloud teams: “Proton doesn’t simplify the process of creating deployment infrastructure nearly enough to be helpful!”</p><p>I justified my <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">“pragmatic CI/CD design”</a> last year by pointing out that, while it involved complex templating, that complexity was distributed mostly where you’d want it: on the shoulders of the platform team. (Their job is YAML! They can deal with it!) Proton has made the same calculation, and drawn the lines of separation mostly in the same places. They are giving raw, somewhat labor-intensive controls to platform teams in order to present a streamlined deployment workflow to app dev teams, with all that nasty infrastructure abstracted away. (Maybe that’s a second reason Proton could be called “serverless?” No server automation for dev teams?)</p><p>Far from being too complicated, I worry that Proton may in fact be oversimplified. Because at the enterprise level, it’s well-nigh impossible to create deployment templates that are really general enough to work out of the box for a diverse portfolio of app teams. Sure, you’ll have a set of “happy path” teams that your templates support quite nicely. But then there are the edge cases, the teams that need services you don’t support or workflows you can’t accommodate. How do you keep them from dropping off into shadow IT … or worse, ballooning every template into an unusable mass of one million parameters?</p><p>These are teams who maybe <em>should </em>be building some of their own infrastructure, who should have less centralized dictation and more decentralized enablement. That’s the “Umbrella” pattern of org -&gt; CI/CD expression I called for earlier this year, <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cd-pipeline">in a blog that reads like lost minutes from a Proton design session</a>. It’s the pattern I’m seeing more and more forward-thinking organizations adopt – those who’ve run with the central cloud team long enough to realize its limits.</p><p><a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">Central cloud teams are bottlenecks</a>, even if 80% of organizations haven’t matured enough to figure this out. And that leads to the most curious question of all: Will teams complex enough to <em>need </em>Proton eventually become too sophisticated to <em>use </em>Proton?</p><p>That remains to be seen, but I do hope that as Proton evolves, it will lead its customers toward sustainable best practices, instead of productizing the organizational mistakes of the past. Customer obsession is great, but as Andy Jassy said in last week’s keynote — sometimes you have to give them not what they ask for, but what they need.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>We need to have some real talk around what we are calling Developer Experience (DX) at developer-focused companies.</p>
<p>It's not well defined, although <a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/">Chris Coyier has done a good survey</a> of what people think of when they hear the term, and others try to define <a href="https://devbizops.substack.com/p/from-developer-experience-to-enablement">Developer Enablement</a>. It's a differentiator among devtools, so of course it is professionalizing, and creeping into job titles (my last job title was "Developer Experience Engineer", whatever that actually means). I fully expect this to develop into a fullblown sub-industry, with conferences and thoughtleaders and gatekeepers and the like (right down to "<a href="https://twitter.com/terronk/status/1286774559274725376?s=20">Dev Advocate Cofounder</a>").</p>

  <h2 id="developer-experience"><a href="#developer-experience">"Developer Experience"</a></h2>
  <p>Here are some things that companies traditionally work on when they "work on DX":</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replacing many with few</strong>: Replacing many lines of code with few lines of code. Replacing many logos with one logo. Replacing many steps with one click (signup, deploy). <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/write-my-code-for-me/">Generating code</a> so you don't have to handwrite it. Providing great value and plenty of functionality as a first-party, out of the box, or with zero config.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensive Documentation</strong>: Getting Started. Example Demos. Interactive Examples. Full API Docs. Guides and Recipes. Good Search. Versioning. (appropriate to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/documentation-levels/">project maturity</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>More tooling</strong>: CLIs, Editor Extensions, Code Snippets, Playgrounds, Language Servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm not at all saying these things aren't important. They're even hard to do well, and fully deserve specialists in their own right. These foundational pieces of developer experience should also be <em>fast</em> and intuitive to the point of <a href="https://johno.com/guessable">guessable</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="developer-exceptions"><a href="#developer-exceptions">"Developer Exceptions"</a></h2>
  <p>But I'm also saying that developers, when they use our products, experience <em>many</em> other things which aren't traditionally the domain of "DX people", because they have to do with core engineering and product promises:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Downtime</strong>: When your service goes down, does your status page lie? Do you refrain from tweeting about it for fear of scaring off customers you don't yet have, rather than reassuring those you do? Do you post prompt, no-bullshit <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">post-mortems</a>? Do you provide good fallback options for when your service is down? Do you practice disaster recovery?</li>
    <li><strong>Response times</strong>: Are you not just meeting your SLAs, but actually clearly answering customer questions? What are you doing for users not yet covered by SLAs? For your open source footprint, do users have confidence that their issues will be addressed and appropriate PRs reviewed, or are you asking people to do free work for you that you then ignore?</li>
    <li><strong>Missing/Incomplete Features</strong>: No product launches feature complete. Nobody expects you to. <strong>The true test is whether you address it up front or hide it like a dirty secret.</strong> As developers explore your offering, they will find things they want, that you don't have, and will tell you about it. How long do you make developers dig to find known holes in your product? Do developers have confidence you will ship or reject these features promptly, or are they for a "v2" that will never come?</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertainty over roadmap</strong>: Do your most avid users know what's coming so they can plan around your plan? If that's too high a bar, do your <em>own employees</em> know what's coming so they can coordinate nicely? Do you have "perma-beta" products? How do you communicate when users ask if they should use "orphan" products? (don't be ashamed, everyone has them)</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertainty over costs</strong>: Is your pricing predictable or do your users need a spreadsheet to figure out what you are going to charge them? If charges are unexpectedly high, can developers use your software to figure out why or do they have to beg for help? Are good defaults in place to get advance warning? Have your employees ever paid for your own product (or had to justify doing so to their own employers)?</li>
    <li><strong>Deprecation/Lock-in/Portability</strong>: Do you <a href="https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc">constantly deprecate APIs and products</a>, causing additional work for no gain? Some amount of lock-in is unavoidable, but are you conscious of how much proprietary API you are foisting on your user? Should your user want to leave someday for whatever reason, have you documented that and made that easy, or are they on their own?</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Are your errors informative or scary? Have you designed them to be searchable or do they only make sense to maintainers? When things go wrong, how quickly does your service surface common issues and offer resolution steps? What about enabling users to answer <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/frontend-observability/">questions they don't yet know they have</a>? If developers are constantly making mistakes and "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-24-apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th.html">holding the phone wrong</a>", is it their fault or yours?</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Logs &amp; Access Control</strong>: Many products start life in single-player mode, and then execute a very clumsy transition to multi-player when they start serving teams and enterprise. When something that shouldn't have been done has been done, do you offer trustworthy sources of truth, and ways to prevent repeats (or, of course, make them impossible in the first place)?</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="causes"><a href="#causes">Causes</a></h2>
  <p>Of course, none of these are new problems, and well known to product management. The problem is mostly organizational - as "developer advocacy" as a discipline evolved from "developer evangelism" (going from a "1 way street" to a "2 way street"), it is now evolving to "developer experience". I see a troubling organizational limitation of DX folks, defining DX to the stuff that focuses on increasing "top of funnel" growth (reducing friction, growing awareness, an endless parade of copycat short term growth hacks) - and having comparatively a lot less impact on the "bottom of funnel" stuff (logo churn, satisfaction scores, account expansion/customer success). <strong>There's little sense making more rain when faced with a leaky bucket</strong>.</p>
  <p>Conway's Law is an <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/eponymous-laws/">eponymous law</a> that states that "organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure". Steven Sinofsky's snappier definition is "<a href="https://medium.com/@donorem/shipping-the-org-chart-3319181be9bd">don't ship your org chart</a>". We need to be careful about the consequences of letting Conway's Law apply to Developer Experience.</p>

  <h2 id="engineering-for-developer-exceptions"><a href="#engineering-for-developer-exceptions">Engineering for Developer Exceptions</a></h2>
  <p>To be clear, I don't really know how to do this yet. I am just thinking out loud. But my intuition is that in order to design exceptional developer experiences, we should pay more attention to developer exceptions. As DX people, we've focused a lot on <code>try</code>, perhaps we should take a good look at <code>catch</code>.</p>
  <p>The first thing to fix is organizational incentives. DX work must not just feel welcome, it must be demanded and good results rewarded. Nobody wants to feel like they are adding weight onto an already overloaded backlog. Most orgs are set up in a way that lack of feedback isn't noticed when it isn't given, and feedback when given feels like additional burden. This is, unsurprisingly, not conducive to feedback.</p>
  <p>The second thing is to establish invariants around your core developer experience and automate monitoring and reporting of these to the fullest extent possible. <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1063585097545220096">Tools that hold the line are incredibly powerful</a>. To progress, you need to first stop regressing.</p>
  <p>My last thought is around helping PMs and EMs create DX, rather than taking primary responsibility. If you're sending in PRs and design docs yourself, you are probably doing too much of someone else's job and will be ineffective and/or resented. Better to provide them the information they need to make decisions and be available for opinions and instant feedback since you represent the end user. It is common for there to be an infinite list of small things to do - and that is very hard to sell internally - so how can you bundle these up into thematic projects, motivate engineers, and carefully communicate progress to the wider world?</p>
  <p>It's time we look beyond the easy questions in developer experience, and start addressing the uncomfortable ones.</p>

           <p>So you've just woke up, with another fantastic idea™. You are a goddam creative professional, you've been here before. You know what to do. You ask yourself excitedly, </p><blockquote>Is the domain available?</blockquote>
           <p>You rush to you favourite domain registrar, credit card burning in your hand. <i>Oh, thank God I got there in time, no one else can touch me now</i>. You buy it. You applaud. You do nothing. Your domain name sits sadly in your account gathering dust, only for you to renew it year-on-year and your idea flutters away like a feather in the wind.</p>

           <h2>Sound familiar?</h2>
           <p>Christ, I'm guilt of this, but the one thing I've learnt over the years, is that the best way to ship something, is <span>not to start with the domain.</span> Domain buying is a folly, a siren singing you to shipwreck. The very action, for me at least only tricks my Lizard brain into thinking I've done <i>something</i> about it. The reality is, you've only done "fake work" as opposed to "real work". </p>
            <p>"Fake work" are the little things that make you feel as if you've moved the needle on your project, but really you've just been procrastinating. Buying domains, reading e-books on marketing, reading this blog post, refactoring code that you aren't happy with - all fake work. Feels good to do it, but leaves your business and projects no closer to moving forwards. Real work on the other hand, actually creates something. A domain name is the sprinkles on the doughnut, not the goo that holds the pieces together. Go build your landing page, then worry about your domain.</p>
           
            <h2>But, erms, what if, someone buys the domain before me?</h2>
            <p>Guess what, domains are just like ideas. Worthless unless you execute on them. Even if someone does decide to buy it, (which is unlikely anyway if it is available) - the domain name doesn't fucking matter.</p><p> Case in point - who in their right mind would have bought the domain Google.com before Google existed? </p><blockquote>It's a brand built on the product, not a product built on the brand.</blockquote><p> You are creative after all, I'm sure you've thousands of ideas - and no shortage of domain creativity to go along with it. What is it going to take once your project is ready to sit down and worry about the domain at <i>that</i> stage? </p>
                <p>Now, stop reading this and go and build something.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the third interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder
									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I've met and
								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Tobi Lütke.</strong></em>
							</p><p>
								Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my
								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is
								no typical day.

							</p><p>My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day
								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.
								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I'm here, and we've been doing this roadshow, but I
								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I
								knew I wasn't going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my
								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it. </p><p>A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes.
								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the
								things I am trying to figure out. </p><p>
								These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how
								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to
								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the
								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has
								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,
								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the
								kind of things that have to be done.

							</p><p>So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a
								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product
								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I'm trying to discern how
								everyone is thinking about the main things we're working on. I do this because
								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,
								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to
								make good decisions.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn't do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of
								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my
								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>
								<b><i>How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your
										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?
									</i></b>
							</p><p>
								A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is
								really fun.
								<i>[laughs]</i>

							</p><p> At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was
								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don't like blue, I can make any color.” And I
								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did. </p><p>
								We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related
								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced
								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the
								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,
								and one-on-ones.

							</p><p>
								And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it's the first
								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot
								easier.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind
										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our
										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive
										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a
										bad meeting with you look like?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<p>So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve
								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that
								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,
								this is going to happen,” I can't get through half of a meeting like this. Partly
								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
										incorrect...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							<p>
								I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it
								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.
								When you're discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.
								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual
								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.
								If I like someone's idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.
							</p>

							<p>I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you've made the following
								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”
								Effectively, I'm trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find
								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being
								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that
								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly
								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the
								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I'm trying to make sure those are rock
								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about
								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the
								direction.</p>

							
							<h2 id="enneagrams"><b>On Enneagrams and Comprehensivists</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and
										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?

									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>Interesting.</p>
							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								I feel like I'm becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually
								don't think it's that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these
								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that
								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth
								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.
								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,
								really well.

							</p>
							<p>
								I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind
								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different
								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at
								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to
								have fruitful and effective conversations.
								And comprehensivist, I mean, that's a fancy word.
							</p>
							<p>

								<i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think I've ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter
								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the
								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto
								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

								</p><blockquote>
									<p>..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
										in another field in different ways...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							
						


							<h2 id="decisionmaking"><b>On Time and Attention on Shopify<br></b></h2>
							<p>
								<b><i>
										You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular
										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script
										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and
										what you ended up learning from it.


									</i></b>
							</p>


							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One
								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly
								veiled as a public company.

							</p>
							<p>We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one
								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think
								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…” </p>

							<p>Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in
								general, is …</p></div></div>

                <p>Similarly, admit that their own compression is lossy, while Promscaleâ€™s is lossless. There is a big difference between lossy compression and lossless. Sometimes lossy compression is okay (eg JPG vs PNG image formats), as long as you know what you are getting. 5/</p>

                <p>Comparing not just IOPS but also durability. Promscale by default requires higher IOPS, but in return offers strong guarantees that you wonâ€™t lose data. We fsync all commits to WAL by default, and return an acknowledgement to Prometheusâ€™s write-request only after commit. 6/</p>

                <p>This means that when Promscale tells Prometheus it stored a thing, it actually stored that thing. 

Promscale also allows users to change this default, in case one desires lower IOPS with lower durability. 7/</p>

                <p>VM by contrast doesnâ€™t have a WAL, and as far as I know there is no solid guarantee of durability even after some time. VM maybe stores the thing. Itâ€™s the UDP of databases.

Again, perhaps an okay tradeoff (eg usage of UDP vs TCP), but one that should be made clear to users. 8/</p>

                <p>So, VM verified that our DBâ€™s memory configuration variable did exactly the right thing. They even used nice Grafana graphs. Thanks! 10/</p>

                <p>But seriously, why wouldnâ€™t you want your database to use the memory you give it for caching? An interesting analysis would be the minimum amount of memory needed to support the workload, but thatâ€™s not what VM did (even though they probably thought they did). 11/</p>

                <p>VM is also not transparent about the qualitative differences: Promscale supports both SQL and 100% standard-compliant PromQL. VM only supports a broken version of PromQL, which a third-party found featured &lt;60% compatibility with PromQL: <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26â€¦</a> 12/</p>

                <p>In addition, Promscale (but not VM) allows you to perform complex analysis, joining metric data with other relational data, using standard SQL visualization and AI/ML tools, supporting enterprise-grade security and permissions, etc. 13/</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>There’s a trend to unify security and developer flows that goes by various names like DevSecOps and “shift left.” Generally security teams seem more enthusiastic about this than developer teams, who refer to security as a <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/open-source-developers-still-not-interested-in-secure-coding/d/d-id/1339654" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“soul-withering chore” or “insufferably boring procedural hinderance.”</a> If developers don’t believe in code hardening ideas, things can go wrong in amusing ways.</p>

Specifically:</p>

<p><em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790270/HCSEC_OversightBoardReport-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report from the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board</a>, page 29, March 2019</em></p>
<p>In net, the report found that about 11% of <code>memcpy</code>-like and 22% of <code>strcpy</code>-like function calls in the codebase were to the least safe variants. And assuming safety just from the function name is simplistic—even the <em>safe</em> variants could still be dangerous.</p>
<p>In Huawei’s defense, while they have been subjected to an unusual level of public scrutiny they are definitely not an outlier in having trouble getting developers to adopt secure coding guidelines. In the <code>memcpy</code> case, it’s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182728/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned at Microsoft</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/05/15/microsoft_banishes_memcpy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2009</a>, but I haven’t personally seen any other companies outside the FAANG (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google) that have done the same. You can actually tell who has banned the bad POSIX functions empirically, by looking at binaries—a non-profit named CITL did a great overview of this and more in the IoT space. As you’d probably guess, the <a href="https://cyber-itl.org/2019/08/26/iot-data-writeup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results are dismal</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clintgibler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler</a> and I <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently presented</a> at Global AppSec SF 2020 about what we think are some of the core principles for successfully bridging the developer/security divide. If you’re looking for a quick takeaway, we suggest three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be fast: scanning should run in parallel and be <em>faster than the slowest test</em>. Otherwise you’re blocking developer workflow.</li>
<li>Be early: if you’re going to complain, the editor is better than commit-time is better than CI.</li>
<li>Autofix: don’t just complain, offer a fix. Even an imperfect suggestion is better than nothing.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>P.S. If you have a giant C codebase sitting around and you want to figure out how much <code>strcpy</code> is used, the two fastest ways are probably <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripgrep, a hyper-fast grep</a> (noisy, fastest) or <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep, a semantic grep-for-code</a> (precise, slower; full disclosure—I work on Semgrep!). Here’s how you could do it in both:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ rg --quiet --stats strcpy -tc
<span>163</span> matches
<span>..</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p>But ripgrep includes some false positives, like commented code:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>45</span>:// string.h is not guaranteed to provide strcpy on C++ Builder.</code></pre></div>
<p>We could obviously try to improve our regex to avoid <code>//</code> at the start of the line, but then we’d have to consider <code>/*</code> also, plus a lot more if we really want to do it right, so it might be nice to have a proper parser, which is what Semgrep provides. If you’re curious about the syntax, there’s an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online tutorial</a> that takes a few minutes or you can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the docs</a>.</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ semgrep -e <span>"memcpy(...)"</span> --lang<span>=</span>c <span>.</span>
<span>..</span>.
ran <span>1</span> rules on <span>1710</span> files: <span>80</span> findings</code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that Semgrep has some parse failures on Webkit; <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C support is still in alpha</a>)</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

Its exclusive features are out of the scope of this article.</li><li><strong>PC Engine Duo/TurboDuo</strong>: A combination of the PC Engine/TurboGrafx and the aftermarket CD-ROM² expansion.</li></ul><p>This article will focus on the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, but will also discuss the expansions that led to the release of the PC Engine Duo/TurboDuo.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Inside this console, we find the <strong>HuC6280</strong>, a chip made by <strong>Hudson Soft</strong> that houses two components. One of them is the CPU, which can operate at two speeds: <strong>~1.79 MHz</strong> and <strong>~7.16 MHz</strong>.</p><p>The HuC6280 is not an off-the-shelf component, like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Z80</a>, but instead a proprietary CPU designed by NEC. After checking out the official docs, it does seem to replicate a lot of behaviour from the famous <strong>MOS 6502</strong> and <strong>WDC’s 65C02</strong>. That being said, what does all of this mean for the programmer?</p><p>Before we start, we’ve already covered some parts of the MOS 6502 <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#cpu">here</a> and also described a 16-bit variant made by WDC and Ricoh <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/super-nintendo/#cpu">here</a>, in case you want to check them out first.</p><p>The 65C02 is another modified version of the MOS 6502 made by Western Design Center, it’s a lot more efficient due to its manufacturing approach (CMOS). From the software side, the 65C02 adds a couple of new instructions and modifies the behaviour of some existing ones.</p><p>We could a lot more about the 65C02, but I think it’s better to focus on the features added by Hudson (complementing the 65C02) because they are critical to efficiently operate this console. Compared to the 65C02, the HuC6280 has:</p><ul><li><strong>More opcodes</strong>, some targeting the components surrounding the CPU.</li><li>An <strong>8-bit I/O port</strong> used to interface external components.</li><li>An <strong>interrupt controller</strong> to receive interrupts from other devices.</li><li>A <strong>timer</strong>. It works by counting down from a specified value and when it finishes, it dispatches an interrupt to the CPU.</li></ul><p>Finally, there are <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> available for general purpose.</p><h4 id="memory-access">Memory access</h4><p>One thing I didn’t mention <em>yet</em> is that NEC also added a <strong>Memory Management Unit</strong> or ‘MMU’ next to the CPU, allowing to handle <strong>21-bit addresses</strong> (remember the original 6502 only has 16-bit addresses). Thus, the amount of memory that can be accessed raises from 64 KB to <strong>2 MB</strong>.</p><p>This MMU is very different from any modern-day MMU. The one found in the PC Engine is composed of <strong>eight 8-bit registers</strong> (called <strong>Mapping Register</strong> or ‘MPR’) which are combined with the CPU’s 16 address lines to form a 21-bit address bus.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/mmu.7db09aefb948cf6a8a5dfb8bfabb5d1b1021970dec3dadcbebef1e688c5d7b06.png"><picture>

Resulting in a 21-bit address.</li></ol><p>Consequently, this MMU groups physical memory in 8 KB pages (12 CPU lines = 8 KB pages), which is the amount of memory the CPU can access without swapping out the MPR nor altering its value.</p><p>Anyway, don’t overwhelm yourself if you have trouble understanding it (it’s just an unconventional modus operandi some may find interesting).</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This is taken care by the <strong>Hudson Soft HuC6270</strong>, a separate chip also referred to as the <strong>Video Display Controller</strong> or ‘VDC’. The HuC6270 will draw everything that the player will see on the screen and its functionality is very similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/master-system/#gpu">Sega’s counterpart</a>, so please check out that article beforehand since I’ll focus on what’s different with Hudson’s offering.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><p>First things first, the VDC is a <strong>tile engine</strong> (pretty much the standard until the 5th generation showed up) but notice how the PC Engine includes <strong>64 KB of VRAM</strong> which is a significant amount compared to the competition. This may lead to a new type of content, which we’ll check later on.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/graphics/vdc.e0bce70688354b7ea91f7f4b486327b8e8f3d6f3cc82580dfb80b51ec10fb88a.png"><picture>

This means that a single address in RAM contains a byte while an address in VRAM stores two bytes, so developers had to watch out for that discrepancy when transferring data to VRAM.</p><p>The reason for this comes down to the way Hudson organised the circuitry: The VDC has a 16-bit address bus but <strong>only the first 15 lines are controlled</strong> (the last one is always set to ‘0’), so odd addresses are fetched from the second byte. I don’t know why Hudson went down this path, but I do know that all of this would make better sense if the system had instead 128 KB of VRAM (since a 16-bit address bus can only access up to 64 KB, so by somehow doubling the data bus, up to 128 KB can be retrieved). Maybe that was the original plan for Hudson/NEC?</p><h4 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h4><p>Aside from the aforementioned granularity oddity, functionality-wise the VDP is very simple. The subsystem has three main components: The <strong>VDC</strong> and <strong>VRAM</strong>, which we already discussed - and the <strong>video encoder</strong> (also called ‘VEC’, we’ll see more about it in due time).</p><p>The system can use multiple resolutions, this is because the game can alter a set of registers that act as parameters for controlling the display timings, which in turn alter when the CRT starts beaming the frame (as opposed to overscan). The minimum resolution is <strong>256 × 224 pixels</strong>, while some homebrew has proved this system can go as high as <strong>512 × 240 pixels</strong>.</p><p>Now let’s see how a frame is drawn step by step, for this, I’ll borrow <em>Bonk’s Adventure</em>’s assets.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-tiles">Tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-storing-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-storing-tiles">Storing tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-background-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-background-layer">Background Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-sprite-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-sprite-layer">Sprite Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-5-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-5-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-tiles"><h4>Tiles</h4><p>As a quick reminder, tiles are just <strong>8x8 pixel bitmaps</strong> that the renderer fetches to draw portions of the screen. With the VDC, the frame is composed of two planes: The background layer and the sprite layer.</p><p>Inside VRAM there’s an area called <strong>Character generator</strong> where tiles exclusive to the background layer are defined. Each pixel of a tile occupies four bits, so it can use up to 16 colours. In theory, up to 4096 background tiles can be defined, but this is less in practice due to VRAM being much smaller.</p><p>Sprites, on the other hand, are drawn using tiles from a separate memory location in VRAM, this is called <strong>Sprite Generator</strong> and differs from the previous Character generator as tiles here are <strong>16x16 pixels</strong> wide.</p><p>The video encoder is a separate chip that stores <strong>32 colour palettes</strong> (16 for the background and 16 for sprites), each palette stores 16 colours and each colour is 9-bit wide (3 bits for Red + 3 bits for Green + 3 bits for Blue).</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-storing-tiles"><h4>Storing tiles</h4><p>(This section is written for those interested in how Hudson took advantage of 64 KB of VRAM with that 16-bit granularity, but you don’t have to understand it completely to be able to follow the rest of the article).</p><p>So far we’ve discussed that each pixel of a tile is stored using 4 bits (or a half byte, also called a <strong>nibble</strong>). Now, Hudson dictates that <strong>tiles are composed of four 8x8 bitmaps</strong> (called ‘CH0’, ‘CH1’, ‘CH2’ and ‘CH3’, respectively). Each map is 1-bit wide, but once the four are combined, they form the final tile with 4-bit pixels.</p><p>Also, remember the 16-bit alignment on VRAM? <strong>Each 16-bit word stores a single row of two 1-bit bitmaps</strong> (8 rows + 8 rows). So, after writing eight entries, two maps will be stored (instead of just one). Please have a look at the diagrams to help understand this better.</p><p>The same happens with Sprite tiles, but since they are 16x16 bitmaps, each bitmap occupies 16 words. To put it another way, to store a single sprite tile, 64 words are taken (equivalent to 8 bytes in VRAM).</p></div><div id="tab-2-3-background-layer"><h4>Background Layer</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/pcengine/graphics/background.08352a4808c29a6f3a808ab30c0e82af9dc2528ac88d7f6ec5816f2caa6af9d8.png"><picture>

  <p>At Shopify we aim to make what most merchants need easy, and the rest possible. We make the rest possible by exposing interfaces to query, extend and alter our Platform. These interfaces empower a rich ecosystem of Partners to solve a variety of problems. The primary mechanism of this ecosystem is an “App”, an independently hosted web service which communicates with Shopify over the network. This model is powerful, but comes with a host of technical issues. Partners are stretched beyond their available resources as they have to build a web service that can operate at Shopify’s scale. Even if Partners’ resources were unlimited, the network latency incurred when communicating with Shopify precludes the use of Apps for time sensitive use cases.</p>
<p>We want Partners to focus on using their domain knowledge to solve problems, and not on managing scalable web services. To make this a reality we’re keeping the flexibility of untrusted Partner code, but executing it on our own infrastructure. We choose a universal format for that code that ensures it’s performant, secure, and flexible: WebAssembly.</p>

<p>What is WebAssembly? According to <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" title="WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly.org</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.”</p>
<p>To learn more, see this series of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/" target="_blank" title="A cartoon intro to WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">illustrated articles written by Lin Clark of Mozilla</a> with information on WebAssembly and its history.</p>
<p>Wasm is often presented as a performant language that runs alongside JavaScript from within the Browser. We, however, execute Wasm outside of the browser and with no Javascript involved. Wasm, far from being solely a Javascript replacement, is designed for <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/" target="_blank" title="Non-Web Embeddings - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web and Non-Web Embeddings alike</a>. It solves the more general problem of performant execution in untrusted environments, which exists in browsers and code execution engines alike. Wasm satisfies our three main technical requirements: security, performance, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Executing untrusted code is a dangerous thing—it's exceptionally difficult to predict by nature, and it has potential to cause harm to Shopify’s platform at large. While no application is entirely secure, we need to both prevent security flaws and mitigate their impacts when they occur.</p>
<p>Wasm executes within a sandboxed stack-based environment, relying upon explicit imports to allow communication with the host. Because of this, you cannot <strong>express</strong> anything malicious in Wasm. You can only express manipulations of the virtual environment and use provided imports. This differs from bytecodes which have references to the computers or operating systems they expect to run on built right into the syntax.</p>
<p>Wasm also hosts a number of features which protect the user from buggy code, including protected call stacks and runtime type checking. <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/" target="_blank" title="Security - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">More details on the security model of Wasm can be found on WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In ecommerce, speed is a competitive advantage that merchants need to drive sales. If a feature we deliver to merchants doesn’t come with the right tradeoff of load times to customization value, then we may as well not deliver it at all.</p>
<p>Wasm is designed to leverage common hardware capabilities that provide it near native performance on a wide variety of platforms. It’s used by a community of performance driven developers looking to optimize browser execution. As a result, Wasm and surrounding tooling was built, and continues to be built, with a performance focus.</p>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>A code execution service is only as useful as the developers using it are productive. This means providing first class development experiences in multiple languages they’re familiar with. As a bytecode format, Wasm is targeted by a number of different compilers. This allows us to support multiple languages for developer use without altering the underlying execution model.</p>
<h2>Community Driven</h2>
<p>We have a fundamental alignment in goals and design, which provides our “engineering reason” for using Wasm. But there’s more to it than that—it’s about the people as well as the technology. If nobody was working on the Wasm ecosystem, or even if it was just on life support in its current state, <strong>we wouldn’t use it</strong>. WebAssembly is an energized community that’s constantly building new things and has a lot of potential left to reach. By becoming a part of that community, Shopify stands to gain significantly from that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We’re also contributing to that enthusiasm ourselves. We’re collecting user feedback, discussing feature gaps, and most importantly contributing to the open source tools we depend on. We think this is the start of a healthy reciprocal relationship between ourselves and the WebAssembly community, and we expect to expand these efforts in the future.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered WebAssembly and why we’re using it, let’s move onto how we’re executing it.</p>
<p>We use an open source tool called <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime" target="_blank" title="Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lucet</a> (originally written by Fastly). As a company, Fastly provides a programmable edge cloud platform. They’re trying to bring execution of high-volume, short-lived, and untrusted modules closer to where they’re being requested. This is the same as the problem we’re trying to solve with our Partner code, so it’s a natural fit to be using the same tools.</p>
<h3>Lucet</h3>
<p>Lucet is both a runtime and a compiler for Wasm. Modules are represented in Wasm for the safety that representation provides. Recall that you can’t <em>express</em> anything malicious in Wasm. Lucet takes advantage of this and uses a validation of the Wasm module as a security check. After the validation, the module is compiled to an executable artifact with near bare metal performance. It also supports ahead of time compilation, allowing us to have these artifacts ready to execute at runtime. Lucet containers boast an impressive startup time of <em>35&nbsp;</em><em><span>μs</span></em>. That’s because it’s a container that doesn’t need to do anything at all to start up.&nbsp; If you want the full picture, Tyler McMullan, the CTO of Fastly, did a great talk which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdWaQOgvd-g" target="_blank" title="Lucet: Safe WebAssembly Outside the Browser by Tyler McMullen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gives an overview of Lucet and how it works</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing how Shopify uses our Wasm engine: Lucet wrapped within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390">
<figcaption>A flow diagram showing Shopify's Wasm engine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We wrap Lucet within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules, which we call the Wasm Engine. This engine is called by Shopify during a runtime process, usually a web request, in order to satisfy some function. It then applies the output in context of the callsite. This application could involve the creation of a discount, the enforcement of a constraint, or any form of synchronous behaviour Merchants want to customize within the Platform.</p>
<h3>Execution Performance</h3>
<p>Here’s some metrics pulled from a recent performance test. During this test, 100k modules were executed per minute for approximately 5 min. These modules contained a trivial implementation of enforcing a limit on the number of items purchased in a cart.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showcasing the time taken to execute a module. The x axis representing the time over the test was running and the y axis is the time represented in ms" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321">
<figcaption>Time taken to execute a module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates a breakdown of the time taken to execute a module, including I/O with the container and the execution of the module. The y-axis is time in ms, the x-axis is the time over which the test was running.</p>
<p>The light purple bar shows the time taken to execute the module in Lucet, the width of which hovers around 100 μs. The remaining bars deal with I/O and engine specifics, and the total time of execution is around 4 ms. All times are 99th percentiles (p99).To put these times in perspective, let’s compare these times to the request times of <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storefront Renderer, our performant Online Store rendering service</a>:</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showing Storefront Renderer Response time" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459">
<figcaption>Storefront Renderer response time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates the request time to Storefront Renderer over time. The y-axis is request time in seconds. The x-axis is the time over which the values were retrieved. The light blue line representing the 99th percentile hovers around 700 ms.</p>
<p>Then if we consider the time taken by our module execution process to be generally under 5 ms, we can say that the performance impact of Lucet execution is negligible.</p>
<h2>Generating WebAssembly</h2>
<p>To get value out of our high performance execution engine, we’ll need to empower developers to create compatible Wasm modules. Wasm is primarily intended as a compilation target, rather than something you write by hand (<a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html" target="_blank" title="Writing WebAssembly By Hand" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">though you can write Wasm by hand</a>). This leaves us with the question of what languages we’ll support and to what extent.</p>
<p>Theoretically any language with a Wasm target can be supported, but the effort developers spend to conform to our API is better focused on solving problems for merchants. That’s why we’ve chosen to provide first class support to a single language that includes tools that get developers up and running quickly.At Shopify, our language of choice is Ruby. However, because Ruby is a dynamic language, we can’t compile it down to Wasm directly. We explored solutions involving compiling interpreters, but found that there was a steep performance penalty. Because of this, we decided to go with a statically compiled language and revisit the possibility of dynamic languages in the future.</p>
<p>Through our research we found that developers in our ecosystem were most familiar with Javascript. Unfortunately, Javascript was precluded as it’s a dynamic language like Ruby. Instead, we chose a language with familiar TypeScript-like syntax called <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/" target="_blank" title="AssemblyScript" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AssemblyScript</a>.</p>
<h2>Using AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>At first glance, there are a huge number of languages that support a WebAssembly target. Unfortunately, there are two broad categories of WebAssembly compilers which we can’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilers that generate environment or language specific artifacts, namely node or the browser. (Examples: <a href="https://github.com/tweag/asterius" target="_blank" title="Asterius: A Haskell to WebAssembly compiler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asterius</a>, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" title="Blazor Build client web apps with C#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Blazor</a>)</li>
<li>Compilers that are designed to work only with a particular Runtime. The modules generated by these compilers rely upon special language specific imports. This is often done to support a language’s standard library, which expects certain system calls or runtime features to be available. Since we don’t want to be …</li></ul></div></div>

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>:</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

    def test_example_2():

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

		<p>12 <strong>African</strong> nations have come together pledging to build a 9 mile wide band of trees that will stretch all the way across Africa, 4750 miles, in order to stop the progressive advancement of the Sahara.</p><!-- START-WP-ADS-ID: 2 --><!-- END-WP-ADS-PRIO -->
<p>Senegal is leading a 12 African nations to build a living defense system appropriately named the Great Green Wall of Africa.</p>
<p>The Sahara is currently the 2nd largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, 60 % of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, significantly expanding the current 9 million square km’s. Even if these estimations prove aggressive, the effects of farmland exploitation on a region already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level.<br>
With this danger in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an remarkable effort to prevent approaching disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg"><img src="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg" alt="Africa" width="300" height="239"></a></p>
<p>Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) extending across the entire region.<br>
9 miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as committed as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stands guard in Northern Senegal, and has cost the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the enormous defense system.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jI_nRHg-0l4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just defense from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to poor communities, and has already transformed usually useless land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries.</p>
<p>The increase of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available to needy people.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'webgl'</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>debugInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getExtension</span><span>(</span><span>'WEBGL_debug_renderer_info'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>vendor</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>

<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past. Core Estimator also provides the Javascript libraries on github <a href="https://github.com/oftn-oswg/core-estimator">[8]</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>
