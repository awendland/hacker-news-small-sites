<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide. Each year <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million</a> people die of tuberculosis, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-malaria#:~:text=Almost%20half%20the%20world's%20population,global%20malaria%20control%20is%20slipping." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">445,000</a> die of malaria, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">290,000-650,000</a> die of influenza. In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale.

Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>

Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>. It is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as deadly</a> as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>



<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover. Millions of Baby Boomers have been forced into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/11/19/nearly-30-million-baby-boomers-forced-into-unwanted-retirement/?sh=4fb8019d5d7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early retirement</a> without adequate savings. Many Americans are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/americans-are-forced-to-raid-retirement-savings-during-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dipping into their retirement funds early</a>. The Congressional Budget Office projects that $2.8 trillion in Social Security funds will be <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/528268-covid-19-damage-to-social-security-to-extend-beyond-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used up in a decade</a> due to the impact of un- and underemployment on lowering contributions.</p>

		“Income is the main determinant of covid mortality.”    </p>
</div>


<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by. Subscription platforms like OnlyFans saw a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-took-their-jobs-away-OnlyFans-let-15175650.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in accounts</a> at the beginning of lockdown. In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>. Lockdown has made OnlyFans a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/celebrities-like-cardi-b-could-turn-onlyfans-into-a-billion-dollar-media-company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion dollar business</a>, but the majority of creators make less than <a href="https://www.xsrus.com/writing/explain/onlyfans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$145 a month</a>.&nbsp;</p>






<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods. This devastation will be compounded by famine and the increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread of untreated diseases</a> like <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624103257.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>. In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction. Many on the left chose to ignore the Biblical scale of the destruction that economic stoppages would cause, arguing that the covid crisis was an <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/quarantine-coronavirus-economy-left-organizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity</a>. Today the left continues to advance the illusion that <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meaningful relief</a> is possible, while workers’ pensions are plundered, children’s futures disappear, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/economy/global-poverty-rate-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 …</a></p></div></div>

Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I'm forever looking for where Henry Miller's Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don't want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p>First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_35196"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_33388"><div><p>I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn't a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple's three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p>They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn't strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn't in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p>What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren't interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14048"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14342"><div><p>Some years later I had a friend who worked at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/" target="_blank">Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</a> on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock</a> and his wife, fellow artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner" target="_blank">Lee Krasner</a>, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" target="_blank">Peggy Guggenheim</a> provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_45411"><div>

He was on his third wife when he settled in at Big Sur and that marriage ended in divorce as well. Once his two children were grown he was an older man living in a small cottage in the forest alone much of the time. Miller helped establish the mystique of Big Sur, but the wealth that followed made his lifestyle difficult for others to replicate on a normal budget.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_59524"><div>

<p>In the United States, there is something of an intense debate over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be pronounced. Many people pronounce it /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ (or, to use fauxnetics, “JAI-roh’). Many other people, however, insist that it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ (that is, “YEE-roh” in fauxnetics). This debate even made it into the recent Disney Pixar animated film&nbsp;<em>Soul</em>, which includes a flashback scene in which a mischievous unborn soul named “Twenty-Two” is portrayed as arguing with the spirit of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes (lived c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) over the correct pronunciation of the word.</p>



<p>If I were an ordinary pedant, I would simply tell you that the pronunciation /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ is correct and that the people who say /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ are wrong. I, however, am no ordinary pedant. On the contrary, I am the most obnoxious and loathsome kind of pedant: a pedant who has spent years studying the Greek language at the university level and who knows far too much about it for my own good.</p>



<p>Therefore, I feel the need to point out that<em>&nbsp;neither&nbsp;</em>of the pronunciations given above is reflective of the actual pronunciation of the word in Modern Greek, since the nominative singular form of the word in Greek is actually γύρος (<em>gýros</em>), with an /s/ sound on the end, and the nominative plural form is actually γύροι (<em>gýroi</em>). Moreover, I feel the need to explain exactly&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;the way the word is spelled in English is so different from how it is pronounced in Greek and to explain precisely how the debate over the pronunciation of the word arose.</p>



<p><strong>A little background</strong></p>



<p>In order to understand the roots of the present controversy over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;should be pronounced, we need to understand why Greek words are often transliterated in ways that don’t reflect how they are actually pronounced.</p>



<p>In order to understand this, we need to go all the way back to Classical Attic Greek, the dialect of the Greek language that was spoken in the region of Attike, which includes the city of Athens, in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, since, as strange as it may sound, the modern system of transliterating Greek words into English is based primarily on equivalences between Greek letters as they were pronounced in the Classical Attic dialect and Roman letters as they were pronounced in Classical Latin over two thousand years ago.</p>



<p>In Classical Attic Greek, γυρός was not the name of a particular kind of sandwich, but rather simply an adjective meaning “round.” Here’s the breakdown of how the word would have been pronounced in Athens in the fifth century BCE:</p>



<ul><li>In Classical Attic Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩ was usually pronounced as the voiced velar plosive /g/ like the letter ⟨g⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>got</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨υ⟩ was usually pronounced as the close front rounded vowel sound /y/ like the letter ⟨ü⟩ in the German word&nbsp;<em>über</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨ρ⟩ was pronounced as the voiced alveolar trill /r/ like the letter ⟨r⟩ in Modern Spanish or Italian.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨o⟩ was pronounced as a short close-mid back rounded vowel /o/ similar to the sound made by the letter ⟨o⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>tote</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨σ⟩, which is conventionally written ⟨ς⟩ when it occurs at the end of a word, was pronounced as the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/ like the letter ⟨s⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>this</em>.</li></ul>



<p>Thus, in Classical Attic Greek, the word γυρός was pronounced /ɡyː.rós/.</p>



<p>During the Hellenistic Period (lasted c. 323 – c. 30 BCE), a new dialect of the Greek language known as “Koine” developed. Koine Greek was based primarily on Classical Attic Greek, but it was also influenced to some extent by other ancient Greek dialects. It became widely spoken throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean.</p>



<p>In Koine, the adjective γυρός was nominalized to become the second-declension masculine noun γῦρος, which means “circle,” “ring,” or “rotation.” Through this nominalization, the accent shifted from an acute accent on the ultima (i.e., the last syllable) to a circumflex accent on the penult (i.e., the second to last syllable), resulting in the noun form being pronounced /ɡŷː.ros/.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Diagram </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle-withsegments.svg"><em>from Wikimedia Commons</em></a><em> of a circle. The word γῦρος or γύρος in Greek literally means “circle” or “rotation.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Sound shifts in Koine and Medieval Greek</strong></p>



<p>At some point between the second century BCE and the third century CE, the consonant sounds represented by the letter ⟨γ⟩ shifted. From roughly this period onwards, ⟨γ⟩ became pronounced as a voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ before the vowels ⟨α⟩, ⟨ο⟩, and ⟨ω⟩. Meanwhile, it became pronounced as a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ before the front vowels ⟨ε⟩, ⟨η⟩, ⟨ι⟩, and ⟨υ⟩. This is a sound very similar to, but slightly different from, the voiced palatal approximant, which is generally represented in English by the consonantal ⟨y⟩.</p>



<p>Other changes in the pronunciation of the Greek language took place during the Middle Ages. By the Middle Byzantine Period, it seems that uneducated people in the countryside of Greece had begun to pronounce the letter ⟨υ⟩ as the close front unrounded vowel /i/, which is the sound made by the letter ⟨i⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>machine</em>. This shift occurred as part of a well-attested process known as “iotacism,” which resulted in the letters ⟨ι⟩, ⟨η⟩, and ⟨υ⟩, which had originally represented three different sounds in Classical Attic Greek, coming to all eventually represent the same sound in Standard Modern Greek.</p>



<p>This shift in the popular rural pronunciation seems to have greatly perturbed the educated elites at the time. In around the eleventh century CE, the Greek writer Michael the Grammarian wrote a satirical poem in which a speaker complains about the way uneducated people in the countryside were pronouncing the letter upsilon. He declares:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Ἐμοὶ πατρίς, βέλτιστε, τραχὺ χωρίον,<br>ὅπου περ ἀνδρῶν καὶ βοῶν ἶσαι φρένες,<br>οἳ το κρύον λέγουσιν ἀφρόνως κρίον,<br>καὶ τὸ ξύλον λέγουσιν ἀγροίκως ξίλον.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This means (in my own translation):</p>



<blockquote><p>“My fatherland, oh dearest one, is a coarse village,<br>where the minds of men and cows are just the same.<br>They foolishly say ‘κρίον’ instead of ‘κρύον’<br>and they boorishly say ‘ξίλον’ instead of ‘ξύλον.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Over time, the pronunciation that Michael derided as coarse and uncivilized seems to have won out; in Standard Modern Greek, the letters ⟨υ⟩ and ⟨ι⟩ are both pronounced /i/. Thus, in Standard Modern Greek, the word γύρος is pronounced /ˈʝiros/.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Scene of everyday agricultural workers from an eleventh-century Greek manuscript of the gospels. It’s very likely that such laborers would have pronounced ⟨υ⟩ as /i/, while the scribe who copied the manuscript probably pronounced it /y/.</em></p>



<p><strong>Origin of the gyros sandwich</strong></p>



<p>Now that I’ve explained the origin of the Greek word γύρος and the history of its pronunciation, I should probably explain where the sandwich of this name originates from and how the name came to be applied to the sandwich.</p>



<p>Today in modern Greece, a cook who is preparing a gyros begins by roasting the meat vertically on a skewer and slicing pieces of meat away when they are done cooking. In Greece and Kypros, gyroi are normally made using pork, but a cook may sometimes choose to use chicken, beef, or lamb meat instead. Once the meat has been removed from the skewer, the cook usually serves it wrapped in pita bread as a sandwich. Often, it is served with tzatziki sauce, onions, and tomatoes.</p>



<p>The modern gyros didn’t arise all at once; many innovations had to be made before the gyros as we know it today could be invented. The first of these innovations was the invention of the idea of cooking meat on spits. This idea is extremely ancient; we know that people in the Aegean Islands were already roasting meat on horizontal spits at least over 3,600 years ago, and they were probably doing it long before that as well. Archaeologists excavating the Bronze Age site of Akrotiri on the Greek island of Thera unearthed stone firedogs dating to the seventeenth century BCE or earlier with notches clearly designed to hold skewers for roasting meats.</p>



<p>The<em>&nbsp;Iliad</em>, an ancient Greek epic poem that was most likely composed in around the early seventh century BCE, describes Chryses, the Trojan priest of the god Apollon, roasting meat on horizontal wooden skewers in book one, lines 458–466. The Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes (lived c. 446 – c. 386 BCE) references similar cooking practices in his plays&nbsp;<em>Acharnians</em>&nbsp;(line 1007),&nbsp;<em>The Clouds</em>&nbsp;(line 178),&nbsp;<em>The Wasps</em>&nbsp;(line 354), and&nbsp;<em>The Birds</em>&nbsp;(lines 388 and 672). Today, meats grilled on horizontal spits are known in Greece as&nbsp;<em>souvlakia</em>; they are distinct from, but similar, to gyroi.</p>

<p>The various other ingredients that are used in gyroi today also had to be introduced to Greece. Some of these ingredients were introduced to the Greek diet relatively early. Notably, pita bread—or at least a very similar kind of flatbread—is known to have existed in ancient Greece. The Greek Egyptian writer Athenaios of Naukratis, who wrote sometime in around the late second or early third century CE, quotes a description of the cooking process for a kind of flatbread known as&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;in his book&nbsp;<em>Wise Men at Dinner</em>&nbsp;3.110b. The description reads as follows, as translated by S. Douglas Olson:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;is more delicate than wafer bread. This type too is probably produced on top of coals, like what Attic authors refer to as an&nbsp;<em>enkryphia</em>. The inhabitants of Alexandria offer it to Kronos and put it out in his temple for anyone who wants some to eat.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Similarly, onions, which are often served on gyroi today, were fairly common in ancient Greek cuisine and they are often mentioned as an ingredient in surviving ancient Greek recipes.</p>

<p>The last year has been particularly annoying for nocoiners—those of us who don’t hold crypto and view bitcoin as a Ponzi, like a Ponzi, or <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme/">something more complex</a>.</p>



<p>We have had to endure Tether minting tethers with abandon ($17 billion worth in 2020 alone) and bitcoiners obnoxiously cheering bitcoin’s new all-time highs, the latest being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever">$33,000</a>. Considering bitcoin began 2020 at around $7,500, that is a long way up. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/">Things went full crazy in March</a>.) But we believe 2021 will be a year of comedy gold when this giant hill of dung all comes tumbling down.  </p>



<p>I’ve spoken with several notable bitcoin skeptics, gathered their thoughts, and compiled a list of new year predictions. They shared their prophecies on Tether (a stablecoin issuer that has so far minted $21 billion in dubiously backed assets to pump the crypto markets), new regulations and the future of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is what they had to say:</p>



<h2><strong>Nicholas Weaver: T’will be the year the music stops</strong></h2>



<p>“This is the year the music stops,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told me.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5212" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/nicholas-weaver-2/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nicholas-weaver-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="257" height="257" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=257 257w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Weaver has been following bitcoin since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. He believes the bitcoin ecosystem is running low on cash. (This is the fate of all Ponzi schemes. Ultimately, they run out of new investors and when that happens, the scheme collapses.) In the case of bitcoin, he believes real dollars in the system are rapidly being replaced by fake ones in the form of tethers.</p>



<p>“Tether has been squeezing every dollar out of the system, and there aren’t enough suckers,” he said, meaning there aren’t enough folks waiting in line to buy bitcoin at its ever increasing prices. “When the dollar stock goes to zero, the system will collapse completely because you get a mining death spiral.”</p>



<p>Miners reap 900 newly minted bitcoin per day in the form of block rewards. If they can’t sell those for enough fiat money to pay their monstrous power bills, it makes no sense for them to stay in business. And since their job is to secure the bitcoin network, bitcoin will become vulnerable to repeated attacks.</p>



<p>Also, governments are finally waking up, said Weaver, alluding to new global efforts to clamp down on money laundering, capital outflows, and the financing of terrorism via cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He foresees Tether getting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a> any day now. He also thinks China will decide “screw it, bitcoin is evading capital controls as a primary purpose, let’s cut off the subsidized electricity.” </p>



<p>Without cheap electricity, bitcoin miners—most of whom are in China—may find it difficult to stay afloat.&nbsp;Already bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia <a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity">no longer receive electricity at subsidized rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jorge Stolfi: I can’t make price predictions</strong></h2>



<p>A computer science professor in Brazil, Jorge Stolfi wants to avoid making predictions on bitcoin’s price. He’s been following bitcoin since 2013—and has seen it through two prior bubbles—so he knows too well that anything can happen. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="5227" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/stolfi/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="stolfi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“I really don’t know how far the insanity can go. The crypto market is 100% irrational, sustained entirely by ignorance and misinformation,” he said. “How can anyone make predictions about that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi is a denizen of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/">r/Buttcoin</a>, a subreddit that makes fun of bitcoin, where he painstakingly explains the finer points of crypto nonsense to the unenlightened. In 2016, he submitted a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/srcboebzx2018040-4064523-169183.pdf">letter</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warning against the risks of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and comparing bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. (The SEC has shot down every bitcoin ETF proposal to date on the basis that bitcoin’s price is too easy to manipulate.)</p>



<p>“And since price determines everything else in the crypto space, I can’t make predictions on pretty much everything else,” Stolfi continued. “For example, If the price were to crash below $10,000, I bet that we would have a lot of comedy gold coming from MicroStrategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the enterprise software company, has funneled $1.2 billion of its funds into bitcoin. As a result, Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, now spends most of his time on Twitter shilling bitcoin.&nbsp;In September, Saylor <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1307029562321231873">compared</a> bitcoin to “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.”</p>



<p>Stolfi also thinks that we will probably forget about several coins that were big in the past, like Bitcoin SV (BSV) and IOTA, maybe even bitcoin cash (BCH). “And we will also forget about blockchain technology.”</p>



<h2><strong>Frances Coppola: Crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last week, Frances Coppola has been battling an army of bitcoin trolls and sock puppets on Twitter after suggesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/status/1345395222243586050">bitcoin is not scarce</a> in any meaningful sense.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5222" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/frances-coppola/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg" data-orig-size="260,260" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="frances-coppola" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg 260w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Scarcity is a key part of the myth bitcoiners perpetuate to make people think bitcoin is valuable in the same way gold is and to create a sense of buying urgency—quick, grab some before it’s all gone!—so naturally, bitcoiners responded by dog piling on her. She isn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope bitcoin crashes and burns because I am so bloody furious, but I think it will be a while yet before it does—maybe about June,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coppola is a UK-based freelance writer, who spent 17 years in the banking industry. She wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Peoples-Quantitative-Easing/dp/1509531300">The Case For People’s Quantitative Easing</a>,” and has 58,000 Twitter followers.</p>



<p>The cause of bitcoin’s upcoming crash, she believes, will be an epic battle between the Wild West of crypto and regulators, a topic she covered in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-financial-system-fight-it">Coindesk article.</a></p>



<p>If the regulators win, crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks and have to comply with things like the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping law that reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crash, she said. On the other hand, if the regulators lose, she believes their next move will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>“We’d see drastic restrictions on what interactions banks can have with crypto, perhaps a total ban on retail-deposit-takers having crypto exchanges and stablecoins as clients,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might also see something akin to a Glass-Steagall Act for crypto exchanges and stablecoins, so that retail deposits are fully segregated by law from trading activity.” By that, she means exchanges won’t be able to lend retail deposits to margin traders or use them to fund speculative positions in crypto derivatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>David Gerard: Bitcoiners will get their big boy wish</strong></h2>

<p>After years of begging for bitcoin to be taken seriously as a form of money, bitcoiners will be getting exactly what they asked for, said David Gerard, a bitcoin skeptic and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Shrugged-Facebook-Tried-Money-ebook/dp/B08KK9SZP6">“Libra Shrugged,”</a> a book on Facebook’s attempt to take over the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year will see more regulation of crypto, as coiners discover to their dismay just how incredibly regulated real-world finance is, he said. “Just wait until someone sits them down and explains regulatory real-time compliance feeds.”</p>



<p>What does Gerard think about Tether? “I could predict the guillotine will finally fall on Tether, but I predicted that for December 2017, and these guys are just amazing in their ability to dodge the blade just one more day,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2018, the New York Attorney General has been investigating Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud. Over the summer, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the companies need to hand over their financial records to show once and for all just how much money really is underlying the tethers they keep printing. The NYAG <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">said</a> Bitfinex/Tether have agreed to do so by Jan. 15.</p>



<p>Gerard also foresees that there will continue to be no use cases for crypto that absolutely anything else does better. “Everything the <a href="http://buttcoinfoundation.org/">Buttcoin Foundation</a> was talking about in 2011 is still dumb and broken,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk says he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-highly-confident-spacex-will-land-humans-on-mars-by-2026.html">“highly confident”</a> that his company SpaceX will be sending humans to Mars in six years. Naturally, Musk wants to set up a self-sustaining city on the red planet. And, come to think of it, the city will need its own crypto, something like Dogecoin or <a href="https://www.marscoin.org/">Marscoin</a>. Otherwise, how else will its citizens pay for things?</p>



<p>Pseudonymous crypto blogger Trolly McTrollface has this prophecy for 2021: “Elon Musk creates its own cryptocurrency, and adds it to the<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $TSLA</a> balance sheet. It ends the year in the top 10 crypto list by market cap.”</p>

<h2><strong>Nouriel Roubini: Bitcoin’s bubble will explode</strong></h2>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, doesn’t mince words when it comes to crypto predictions. He simply told me: “The Bitcoin bubble will burst in 2021. Triggers will be reg/law enforcement action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is good reason to take him seriously. Roubini famously warned of the 2008 financial crisis, a prophecy that earned him the moniker “Dr. Doom.”&nbsp;He is also <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/dr-doom-s-bubble-burst-nouriel-roubini-s-hot-tub-gets-heave-ho">known for his parties</a>, which leads a few of us nocoiners to believe that bitcoiners’ are fundamentally driven by bitterness over the fact that we have better soirées.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>After the JPEG standard was released in 1992, JPEG images became synonymous with digital photography and are used in almost every application which works with photo quality images. The reason the adoption of the standard was fast and nearly universal is that it makes use of multiple techniques simultaneously to reduce the compressed file size. One of those is an understanding of the limits of the human visual system and which information is important to preserve versus which is less important and can be removed.</p><h2 id="the-jpeg-coding-algorithm">The JPEG coding algorithm</h2><p>There are several steps needed to compress an image using the JPEG method (see image below). To begin, it is usually converted from RGB into the YCbCR colorspace. The reason this is necessary is to allow sub-sampling of the pixels. The human eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance than changes in chrominance. This allows the chroma channels to be downsampled while keeping the luma channel at full resolution. The image can lose 50% of its data with this step and the perceived degradation is quite minimal. The image is then divided into 8x8 MCUs or minimum coded units (the equivalent terminology for video codecs is Macro Blocks). These MCUs are square blocks of pixels which are compressed based on the similarity to each other. The pixels in each MCU are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discrete Cosine Transform</a> (DCT). The operation allows for the easy removal of high frequency information (fine detail) to further compress the image. The more high frequency coefficients are removed, the smaller the file and the blurrier the image becomes. This effectively controls the “Q Value” or compression amount used by encoders.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding@2x.png 2x" alt="JPEG coding steps"><figcaption>JPEG coding steps</figcaption></figure><p>One of the many clever ideas incorporated into the standard is to use the similarity in DC value (essentially the brightness) between adjacent MCUs to further reduce the data size by compressing just the change from one to the next instead of encoding the entire value. This is depicted above in the “DPCM coding” block. This is a great idea, but it creates a small problem. By having each successive MCU’s DC value(s) depend on a delta from the previous, it means that if there is an error in the data, the MCUs from that point on down will all be wrong.</p><p>Making matters slightly worse is that the compressed symbols which encode the image data (shown above as “Huffman coding”) are Variable Length Codes (VLC). A single wrong bit can corrupt the data from that point forward. Back in the ‘old’ days when JPEG was invented, this was a very real concern because images were often transmitted over channels (e.g. acoustic modem) that may not have had robust error correction or stored on media (e.g. floppy disks) that were prone to errors. Knowing that the data may suffer from errors, a feature was added to the standard to mitigate the amount of the image that would be corrupted by bad data. The idea was to periodically reset the previous DC value to 0, forcing the next MCU to encode its entire value as a delta from 0. This means that any corrupted DC values will only affect pixels up to the next restart point.</p><p>This is implemented with Restart Markers. They are 2-byte markers placed in between the MCUs at regular intervals (e.g. every 100 MCUs). If a data corruption occurs, it’s easy to scan forward in the file to the next restart marker (JPEG markers are always on byte boundaries and preceded by 0xFF). Once the next restart marker is found, the image can be properly decoded from that point on since the number of MCUs between each restart marker is known.</p><h2 id="the-ever-evolving-use-of-digital-images">The ever evolving use of digital images</h2><p>Starting not long after the JPEG standard was released, computer networks and storage were getting more reliable and incorporated error detection and correction (e.g. TCP/IP). The solid state storage cards used in digital cameras were quite reliable and the restart markers were ‘forgotten’ for a while since they made the files slightly larger without giving much perceived benefit. During that period, computer software was mostly designed to run on a single processor using a single thread. The fact that a JPEG image needed to be decoded in a single pass due to its use of variable length codes and a string of successive delta values for the MCU didn’t cause any problems for software since it was designed to run as a single thread anyway.</p><p>In the last few years however, computers and our use of JPEG images have changed dramatically. Nearly every computing device has multiple CPUs and runs an operating system with multiple threads (even phones). The other change is that people are taking, editing and viewing billions of JPEG photos on their mobile phones. Each generation of phones produce larger and higher resolution images. For anyone working with tons of photos, the time to encode and decode them has become increasingly important because of the sheer volume and size of new images being generated.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart@2x.png 2x" alt="The sum of transfer size kilobytes of all external images requested by the page."><figcaption>The average transfer size of images requested by the web page. Data source: <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Archive</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="repurposing-a-good-idea-into-an-even-better-idea">Repurposing a good idea into an even better idea</h2><p>Computers have been getting more powerful on a mostly continuous trajectory since the 1970s. A general term used to describe the continuous improvements in silicon processing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moore’s Law</a> was coined many years ago to commemorate Gordon Moore’s prediction that computers will double the number of transistors every 18 months. This has held mostly true for the transistor count, but the maximum speed of computers has basically hit a dead end due to the physical limitations of silicon and power+heat issues. Since individual processor speed hasn’t advanced much in the last few years, the emphasis has shifted to employing many processors to complete tasks faster by working in parallel. In today’s computing environment, it’s advantageous to be able to divide a task into sections and assign them to multiple CPUs. Not all tasks are possible to divide because each successive part may depend on the results from the previous. JPEG encoding and decoding are normally difficult to divide into pieces and run in parallel because of the way each successive MCU depends on the previous one and the use of variable length codes.</p><p>However… A convenient benefit of restart markers is that the VLC data is reset to a byte boundary (after the marker) and the MCU DC delta value is also reset. This means that both JPEG encoding and decoding could be divided into multiple threads with the use of restart markers. For encoding, the image could be divided into symmetrical strips and each strip could be encoded by a different processor. When each processor completes that task, the output of each can then be ‘glued’ together using restart markers. For decoding, the task can be spread across as many processors as there are restart markers. The only extra effort needed is to scan forward in the compressed data looking for the restart markers first since the size of the compressed data between each varies and there is no ‘directory’ in JPEG files showing where the restart markers are located.</p><h2 id="real-world-example">Real World Example</h2><p>With multi-threaded applications, the performance rarely scales 1:1 with the number of CPUs utilized (e.g. splitting a task into 12 threads on 12 CPU cores doesn’t mean it will run 12x faster). There is extra overhead in managing the threads and the memory is usually a single entity shared among the processors. Let’s run a test on the following image:</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-timings-image.jpg" alt="JPEG timings example image"><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@matthewhenry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Henry</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Among other techniques, at Optidash we incorporate this idea of using restart markers to greatly accelerate both the decoding and encoding of images. The image above was run through one of our testing tools on a 2018 MacBook Pro 15” laptop with a 6-core Intel i7 processor. Here are the results:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Number of CPUs</td><td>Image decode time</td><td>Image encode time</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>53ms</td><td>264ms</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>25ms</td><td>104ms</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>18ms</td><td>61ms</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see in the table above, there is a measurable advantage to splitting JPEG coding into multiple parts and assigning them to different CPUs. Depending on the task, the speed rarely scales linearly when using more CPUs. In this case, the intense use of large areas of memory limits how much benefit multiple CPUs can improve the overall speed.</p><p>Here’s some pseudocode which demonstrates how a multi-threaded JPEG encoder might look:</p><pre><code>void ThreadedWriteJPEG(assorted JPEG parameters, int numThreads) {
    int slice;
    pthread_t tinfo;

    // set completion counter
    sliceRemaining = numThreads;

    // Start a thread for each slice
    for (slice = 0; slice &lt; numThreads; slice++) {
        pthread_t tinfo;

        // Use a ‘slice’ structure to hold info about each thread’s work
        // This includes a pointer to the start of that strip of pixels
        // and the number of lines to compress

        &lt;setup slice structure for each thread’s work&gt;

        pthread_create(&amp;tinfo, NULL, JPEGBuffer, &amp;slices[slice]);
    } // for each slice

    // wait for all worker threads to finish
    WaitForThreads(&amp;sliceRemaining);

    // merge slices into a single file and write it
    WriteJPEGBuffer(slices, numThreads);
}
</code></pre></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Obsidian is described as “A second brain, for you, forever”. It is a desktop app (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that acts as a knowledge base working on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>



<p>The app is developed by the hugely talented Licat (Shida Li) and Silver (Erika Xu) who also brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynalist</a>&nbsp;(an outliner note-taking tool similar to <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">Logseq</a>).</p>



<p>The app is offered as a free download, although sponsoring the devs is possible by upgrading your license through a one-time payment (USD 25+). By upgrading the license, we gain insider builds (early releases) and access to the exclusive dev channel on Discord.</p>



<h2>Why Obsidian?</h2>



<p>Your notes are saved locally on your machine in plain text markdown format, allowing you to easily transfer your notes to other apps or open them with Notepad, in essence, there is no vendor lock-in. You are in complete control of your notes and files and can use Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox etc. to sync your notes between different machines.</p>



<p>Having control over my notes gives me peace of mind. I am free to do what I want with them, and even though with the Obsidian app I can use various functions (backlinks, graph view, etc.) I know that should the app disappear, the content is mine and will forever be mine.</p>



<p>The ease of using the app could not be more straightforward. Once downloaded and installed, you are greeted with a welcome screen similar to the one below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="650" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>From here you can either create a new vault (notes repository) or open an existing vault. You can also open the “help vault” which includes several help files such as a formatting guide, and appearance customisation guides amongst other how-tos.</p>



<p>Once you have created / opened a vault, you can start taking notes at your heart’s content. You are free to choose to structure your notes the way you wish. You can have folders similar to traditional note-taking tools or go structure free and store all your notes in one main directory.</p>



<p>The beauty of creating links between your notes (with a simple [[“name”]] link) means that you should always be able to find what you are looking for and generate ideas (see <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">Personal Knowledge Management</a>) from your notes.</p>



<p>The app works in markdown format with the possibility of rendering the preview side by side, as shown below. You can also have more than one note open simultaneously by opening additional panes that can be infinitely split and resized. This is great if you want to cross-reference notes or create a work product from multiple notes.</p>

<p>The markdown format may feel a little overwhelming at first, but things get easier after taking a few notes. The other benefit of having notes in markdown or rendered view is that it is easy to copy and paste the text into an online blogging platform or a Word document. For instance, I created this post in Obsidian and copied and pasted the text to WordPress and voila.</p>



<p>Having said the above, the lack of a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type interface is a little annoying in my point of view. Sometimes the markdown format is confusing to read, or if you are in preview mode, you need to go back to edit mode to tweak the text. The good news is that this is on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>. Fingers crossed this comes soon.</p>



<p>In addition to the devs being hugely talented and ever-present to answer questions and chat on the Discord, the speed of development is phenomenal. Nearly every other week, we are presented with an update that includes new features and bug fixes.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>



<p>There are a significant amount of features available in Obsidian, so I thought to include below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Offline – <em>can access whether connected or not. Notes are stored offline and are yours</em></li><li>Backlinking – <em>easily see which pages link to the page</em></li><li>Random Note – <em>opens a random note which is useful for discovering old content</em></li><li>Daily Note – <em>create today’s note at the click of a button</em></li><li>Starred Notes – c<em>an star “favourite” notes for easy access</em></li><li>To-do list – <em>easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Outline – <em>see the structure of your note and easily navigate to other sections by clicking</em></li><li>Search – <em>easily find what you are looking for</em></li><li>Graph View –&nbsp;v<em>isualise a page or your notes collection in a graph with many different filter / view options</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video I did of the main features available in Obsidian.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Obsidian Introduction - A alternative Roam Research app for Notes / PKM / To Do / Journal" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJYHMCbqZbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the above main features, there are a couple of additional features which warrant a separate mention. These are:</p>



<h2>Publish</h2>



<p>A useful feature of Obsidian is Obsidian Publish where you can take your notes and convert them into an online digital garden / blog. The simplicity of doing this through “no code” means that there is no prior technical knowledge required. You only need to sign up (USD 8 per month per site (early-bird price)), choose a name, select which notes to publish and there you have it – your own personal online space.</p>



<p>The outcome can look something like this <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>. Developments are in the pipeline to allow for custom domains and other tweaks to make it more personal and improve the experience.</p>



<h2>Plugins</h2>



<p>With the ability to install and use third-party plugins and such a large community of users, many plugins are available to choose from to customise the app to suit your needs. The plugins are easily installed in the app (simply click install on the plugins browser page within Obsidian) and allow you to do things like:</p>



<h3>Mind Map</h3>



<p>View your note as a mind map. For example, activating the mind map view on this article results in the following diagram:</p>







<p>I find this plugin great as although you can see the note’s outline using the Obsidian outline feature, this allows you to visualise it differently.</p>



<h3>Calendar</h3>



<p>Enables a Calendar View to visualise and navigate between daily notes and easily create a daily note for a past, or future date.</p>







<h2>Areas of Improvement / Wish List</h2>



<p>There are a few areas of improvement which I feel would elevate the app even further. These improvements include:</p>



<ul><li>A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type editor interface,</li><li>Mobile app to view / take notes on mobile,</li><li>Ability to see more information on notes in bulk (like date created, last modified, word count).</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a few tweaks and the addition of a WYSIWYG interface, this app has the potential to become a top note taking app. Notes are stored locally, so are yours and forever yours. The features available in the app allow you to take notes, visualise your notes and generate ideas easily.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is meant to help find clues as to who is calling you when you’re receiving calls from an unknown phone number (a number that is displayed on your phone’s screen, but you don’t recognize).</p><p>It’s quite short and simple, and I hope it helps, as it’s written with the intention of tracking whoever may be bothering or harassing you.</p><p>First I’d like to clear up the following meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>unknown phone number</strong> – a phone number that is displayed on my phone’s screen but I don’t have the caller’s information</li><li><strong>private phone number</strong> – a number that’s not displayed on my screen when someone is calling because the caller is withholding their number.</li></ul><p>I wanted to quickly clear this up because I suspect some interpret the term of <strong>unknown phone number</strong> as <strong>private phone number/call</strong>, and I don’t want to take up someone’s time with information that’s not useful to them.</p><h2 id="method-1-finding-the-facebook-account-associated-with-the-unknown-number">Method 1 – Finding the Facebook account associated with the unknown number</h2><p>With this method we’ll try to have Facebook show us the account associated with the phone number by trying to login with it and then clicking <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Forgot Password?</code>, which will lead us to the next page where Facebook shows us the associated account.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert in this area. Although I don’t think that investigating an unknown phone number in this manner is an offence in any way, I do think you should proceed at your own risk.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that even though this method probably has a good chance of working, the number may not be associated with a Facebook account.</p><p>Also, since it will look like you’re trying to log in, Facebook will probably notify the user in some form. In my case I just got notified that I can enable one click login, for security reasons.</p><p><img width="593" height="532" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" alt="word image 7" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 12" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w"></p><p>I’m not certain of other cases, however.

Add the unknown number to your contact list</h3><p>I assume it doesn’t have a high success rate, but it’s pretty low effort and I think it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Just add the phone number to your contacts under whatever name you’d like, and then look up that contact in WhatsApp to check out if they have a profile pic.</p><p>That profile pic may be either a selfie or something that can help you identify if you know that person.</p><h3 id="2-reverse-image-search-the-profile-picture-video">2. Reverse Image Search the Profile Picture [Video]</h3><p>If you think the image is not very generic, and it’s likely they used it on other websites, such as social media, you can also perform a reverse image search using <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a> and see if something comes up.</p><p>I know this is probably nothing new, but an additional thing you can do is limit the image search to a specific site.</p><p>For example if you search someone’s profile picture and get a good deal of results with all sorts of websites, and additional similar images that aren’t an exact match, you can limit the search to just one social media site, such as Twitter.</p><p>To do this you use the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:example.com</code> operator.</p><p>For example if we want to limit our reverse image search to Twitter, we’d search for the image first, and then replace the existing text in the Google search bar with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code></p><h4 id="quick-demo-video-2">Quick Demo Video</h4><p>The steps are:</p><ol><li>Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a></li><li>Drag the image onto the search bar, or click the little camera icon and insert the URL to the image, or select <strong>Upload an image</strong> and then <strong>Choose File</strong> and then browse for the picture on your computer.</li><li>Next, Google will show us what matches were found.I’ll use this website’s social media profile pic as an example.<p>As you can see, Google sees our profile pic as being similar to many other images, and provides a list of many other websites associated with those images.</p><p><img width="665" height="683" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="word image 12" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 19" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w"></p></li><li>Since we’re interested in mainly social media websites to have a good chance of identifying someone, we’ll filter the results by limiting the search only to Twitter, in this example.<p>You can, of course, try other social media websites popular in your region.</p><p>So in the search bar we’ll just remove the text, in this case <strong>digital alberta</strong>, and replace it with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code>.</p><p>After the search is complete, we can see that even though it’s not the first result, we’ve still found the Twitter profile associated with the image.</p><p><img width="732" height="1270" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" alt="word image 13" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 20" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w"></p></li></ol><p>I hope these methods come in useful or give you some peace of mind in some cases when you’re having issues with numbers you don’t recognize.</p><h2 id="other-methods">Other Methods</h2><p>Here I’ll just list other methods that could work.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>Every time I go back to Rust, I have to figure out how the module system works again. Here are some of my notes comparing it to Python’s module system.</p>

<p>These notes are for Rust 2018.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#crates" id="markdown-toc-crates">Crates</a></li>
  <li><a href="#packages" id="markdown-toc-packages">Packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-layout" id="markdown-toc-file-layout">File layout</a>    <ul>
      <li><a href="#crate-roots" id="markdown-toc-crate-roots">Crate roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="#module-lookups" id="markdown-toc-module-lookups">Module lookups</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nested-modules" id="markdown-toc-nested-modules">Nested modules</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crates">Crates</h3>

<p>A <strong>crate</strong> is a build target in Rust. A crate can either be a library or a binary. It can be built with <code>cargo build</code>.</p>

<p>In Python, libraries are called “packages”. Binaries are an entirely heterogenous concept, typically installed by configuring <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>. Such a binary doesn’t even need to be Python code (for example, it can be a shell script instead).</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>A <strong>package</strong> in Rust consists of up to one library crate and any number of binary crates. (It’s required that there be at least one library or binary crate.)</p>

<p>In Python, a single “distribution package” (i.e. one that you can <code>pip install</code>) can contain multiple “import packages” (i.e. one that you can <code>import</code>), while Rust allows at most one import package per distribution package.</p>

<h3 id="file-layout">File layout</h3>

<h4 id="crate-roots">Crate roots</h4>

<p>Python places <code>__init__.py</code> at the root of a package to indicate that it’s importable as a package. Similarly, Rust conventionally puts <code>lib.rs</code> at the root of a crate as the library <strong>crate root</strong>. (Unlike Python, the name can be re-configured, but <code>lib.rs</code> is the default.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>__main__.py</code> corresponds to the main entry point for the module when run with <code>python -m</code>. Rust conventionally puts <code>main.rs</code> as a binary crate root. (This can also be renamed, which is probably desirable if you have more than one binary.)</p>

<h4 id="module-lookups">Module lookups</h4>

<p>In Python, all modules are available by importing them via their filesystem path name. For example, <code>import foo.bar</code> first looks for a <code>foo/</code> directory on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Then it looks for a <code>bar/</code> package or a <code>bar.py</code> module underneath the <code>foo/</code> directory.</p>

<p>In Rust, modules also correspond to their paths on the filesystem (by default; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute">you can use the <code>path</code> attribute</a> to change this behavior). However, they are not immediately <code>use</code>-able just because the corresponding file is present! They must be declared with a <code>mod foo;</code> declaration in the crate root file (e.g. <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>

<h4 id="nested-modules">Nested modules</h4>

<p>In Python, a nested module <code>foo.bar</code> is implemented either by <code>foo/bar.py</code> or <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code>. You can’t use both. If you want to have sub-modules of <code>foo.bar</code>, you’ll place additional modules or packages under <code>foo/bar/</code>.</p>

<p>A statement like <code>from foo.bar import qux</code> could either be importing a symbol declared in <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code> or the module <code>foo/bar/qux.py</code>. Some developers choose to explicitly re-export the public interface of <code>bar</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> for clarity, and prefix sub-modules with underscores (e.g. <code>_qux.py</code> instead of <code>qux.py</code>).</p>

<p>In Rust, you use <code>foo/bar.rs</code> to declare members of the namespace <code>foo::bar</code>. If you also want to have sub-namespaces of bar (e.g. <code>foo::bar::qux</code>), then you additionally create the <code>bar/</code> directory alongside <code>bar.rs</code>. To access a sub-namespace <code>qux</code> inside <code>bar.rs</code>, the line <code>mod qux;</code> must be added to <code>bar.rs</code>. (This is similar to how we have to add <code>mod foo;</code> at the top-level <code>lib.rs</code>.)</p>

<p>To re-export the namespace and make it available to all users outside of <code>bar</code>, it should be changed to <code>pub mod qux;</code>.</p>

<p>The main take-away is that Rust requires the explicit re-exporting of nested modules using <code>mod</code> at each step of the hierarchy, while Python does not.</p>

January 2, 2021
☼ <a href="https://ylukem.com/tagged/writing">writing</a>
</p>
<p>This Christmas, a family member sent me a <span>URL</span> to a family Zoom call. However, they didn’t send me a direct link to Zoom. Instead, they sent me a<span></span> <span>“</span>tinyurl.com” link.</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link, my <span>URL</span> bar flashed an intermediate domain that was neither Zoom nor TinyURL. Later, I used cURL to see where this <span>URL</span> was really going.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v https://tinyurl.com/examplezoom
...
&gt; GET /examplezoom HTTP/2
&gt; Host: tinyurl.com
...
&lt; location: https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC</code></pre>
<p>
<em>(all <span>HTTP</span> responses abridged for clarity)</em>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the redirect wasn’t clean at all. TinyURL was first sending me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigLink" target="_blank">VigLink</a><a href="#footnote-1WA7" id="ref-1WA7"><sup>1</sup></a>. VigLink is an advertising (tracking) company that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Following the redirect in cURL reveals another unsavory fact. VigLink <em>sets cookies</em> before they send me to the intended destination on Zoom.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v <span>'https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC'</span>
&gt; GET /?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: redirect.viglink.com
...
&lt; Set-Cookie: vglnk.PartnerRfsh.p=; Domain=.viglink.com; Path=/; SameSite=None; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Secure
&lt; Set-Cookie: vglnk.Agent.p=v-c935c520ecc561fe60a9418874e023b7; Domain=.viglink.com; Path=/; SameSite=None; Expires=Mon, 01 Feb 2021 16:52:34 GMT; Secure</code></pre>
<p>These cookies give them the ability<a href="#footnote-2WA7" id="ref-2WA7"><sup>2</sup></a> to track me across every other site that uses their advertising tech. Who knows what VigLink is doing with my data, but I personally wouldn’t trust an advertising company to keep my browsing history to themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t give me a chance to opt-out of this tracking. I’m currently based in Europe and I would expect to see at least an interstitial asking for consent to be tracked. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">TinyURL’s privacy policy</a>, last updated in 2012, has no mention of either third party data-sharing nor the cookies they share from affiliates.</p>
<p>This isn’t a phenomenon limited to TinyURL. More common <span>URL</span> shorteners like t.co (Twitter) and bit.ly set cookies when you click on a link. While neither redirect you to an advertising company like TinyURL, Twitter’s primary business model is advertising, and <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank">bit.ly’s privacy policy</a> says they share data with third parties to<span></span> <span>“</span>…provide advertising products and services…”</p>
<p>Don’t use <span>URL</span> shorteners. And if you click on a link from a <span>URL</span> shortener, I recommend using tools like the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/" target="_blank">Temporary Containers Firefox extension</a> to limit the scope of ad tracking. Personally, I took the time to send Sovrn (VigLink’s parent company) a <a href="https://ylukem.com/files/_viglink-gdpr-email.png"><span>GDPR</span> request</a>, and made sure to give them my tracking cookie. I’ll update this blog and <a href="https://ylukem.com/newsletter">my newsletter</a> if I actually get anything substantive back.</p>

<p>Speed and safety without garbage collection, reference counting, or borrow checking!</p>

<p>
Vale's <b>hybrid-generational memory</b> is a new memory model that combines all the best parts of existing memory strategies: it's as easy as garbage collection, as deterministic as reference counting, and could even be as fast as borrow checking. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a> <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>
<p>
The <b>generational reference</b> is the keystone of the entire approach, the lynchpin that makes it all work. Keep reading to learn how it works!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Note that hybrid-generational memory is <b>still in development</b>. We have some very promising early results, so we're sharing the idea to show you where Vale is headed. If you want to be part of this and bring hybrid-generational memory into the world, come <a href="https://vale.dev/contribute">join us</a> and help make it happen!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it. <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want.
</p>
<p>
Our goal here is to make it so when we dereference a non-owning reference, the program safely halts (or does something else <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>) instead of triggering memory unsafety. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To keep the language simple and the learning curve easy, we explicitly don't want to force a borrow checker on the user. However, we'd like an approach that has as little <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory#afterword-how-might-it-compare-to-rust">run-time overhead</a> as the borrow checker.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a><a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Vale has three release modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Resilient mode, which is fast and memory safe; it will halt the program when we try to dereference a freed object.
</li>
<li>
Assist mode, for development, to detect potential problems even earlier.
</li>
<li>
Unsafe mode, which turns off all safety.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilient mode uses hybrid-generational memory.

Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.

This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.

and the person who opens the door says:

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used genHeap.c for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
								<p>Concept creep has to be one of my biggest pet peeves.</p>
<p>What’s concept creep? It’s pretty much what it sounds like. Concept creep occurs when a concept that originally meant something very specific later comes to encompass a much broader set of unrelated, or only loosely related, phenomena.</p>
<p>Psychology has been particularly plagued by concept creep. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418?journalCode=hpli20&amp;">According to Nick Haslam</a>, who is credited with coining the phrase:</p>
<p>Many of psychology’s concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.&nbsp; Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms: concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena…In each case, the concept’s boundary has stretched and its meaning has dilated.&nbsp;Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated, concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood.</p>
<h2>Codependency, Narcissism, and Emotional Labor Are Very Specific Things</h2>
<p>Many concepts have fallen prey to this effect. One notable example is&nbsp;<a href="https://poly.land/2018/04/13/polyamory-helped-ditch-codependence-find-healthy-interdependence/">codependency,</a>&nbsp;which had a very specific meaning when it was first coined in substance abuse circles (the state of another person being co-addicted to substances by proxy, owing to their close relationship with an addict) but now is used by the general population to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing to do with the original concept and aren’t necessarily even pathological depending on the particular context (thinner than average boundaries, people pleasing, dependence in general, etc.).</p>
<p>A similar fate has befallen&nbsp;<em>narcissism.&nbsp;</em>There are actually pretty specific criteria for narcissistic traits, behavior, and of course the full blown personality disorder. However, it’s fashionable now for lay folks to label anyone that behaves like a jerk a “narcissist,” where many times the person in question is actually showing a pattern of behavior more consistent with other cluster B disorders (i.e., antisocial, borderline, histrionic). Or they’re just being kind of jerky and inconsiderate — but in a way that’s divorced from anything that’s really beyond the diagnostic pale. Because just because someone’s annoying or acting in a hurtful way, it doesn’t make them disordered.</p>
<p>It’s happening virtually everywhere you look. The Atlantic ran a piece recently on how <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/arlie-hochschild-housework-isnt-emotional-labor/576637/?fbclid=IwAR02EtM3N1RaZiq3fF48-uz32pWWoJ0iCxM-Tab6N7WPHV7-np4Vxl406zM">emotional labor has suffered concept creep</a>, an article which features an interview with the sociologist who originally coined the term.</p>
<h2>Not All Psychological or Emotional Invalidation Is Gaslighting.</h2>
<p>However, I would have to say that in my own work these days, I’m most frequently dealing with concept creep in regards to gaslighting.</p>
<p>The term <em>gaslighting</em> originally referred to a very specific form of psychological manipulation. Its origins stem from a play from the 1930s called&nbsp;<em>Gaslight</em>, in which a man tries to make his wife and other people think she’s insane by messing with small aspects of her environment and then telling her she’s wrong and possibly insane when she later points it out to him. In one instance, this literally involves <em>dimming gaslight</em>s in the house while he’s up to some shenanigans (he’s not a nice dude and also killed another lady and is rooting around looking for the dead woman’s jewels), thus the name.</p>
<p>So the term gaslighting informally came to describe an effort to manipulate someone’s perception of reality in a way that can make someone else feel crazy and doubt their own sanity. Where classically this process was dependent on a person messing with physical objects in one’s external environment, it’s also come to be understood that it’s possible to gaslight someone through less concrete methods: Lying, misdirection, denial, etc.</p>
<p>This is fine and a fairly minor extension of the original more literal use.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> a problem, however, is that people have started to use it refer not just to this specific form of manipulation but instead to refer to <em>any</em> form of psychological invalidation.</p>
<p>One common misapplication I’ve seen many times in my travels is the following: In situations in which your partner disagrees with you about a subject that’s actually quite ambiguous and you get hurt by it, people are quite eager to jump in and say that the partner is gaslighting you. But that’s not what gaslighting is. Not every hurtful interpersonal conflict is (in fact, while gaslighting certainly happens, it’s relatively rare compared to other more common forms of maladaptive relating).</p>
<h2>Emotional Invalidation Versus Gaslighting</h2>
<p>However, it’s trendy so people are using the word&nbsp;<em>a lot —&nbsp;</em>whether they really&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>or not. Often what’s being mistakenly described as gaslighting these days is at best an honest disagreement over something ambiguous — or at worst, it’s an instance of emotional invalidation.</p>
<p>What’s emotional invalidation? It’s when someone else tells you that your emotions or thoughts aren’t valid. This can happen in a number of ways. Someone can simply ignore them and go about their merry way without considering them. Or they can outright judge you for them (“that’s a stupid way to feel”). They can even reject your own assessment of your emotional state by telling you, “Oh that’s not how you really feel.”</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation hurtful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation gaslighting? Nope, not really.</p>
<p>A better example of gaslighting would be if someone told you that they never had conversations with you that you know you did and tell you that you must be crazy or overworked if you think that actually happened. Or if they’re hiding things on you and telling you that you must be mistaken about those items getting lost (especially if they put them back in their original place later, causing you to doubt your sanity).</p>
<h2>But What Does It All Mean, Basil?</h2>
<p>Okay, so <a href="https://poly.land/2018/11/02/that-doesnt-need-to-be-a-word-is-an-incredibly-boring-stance/">language is evolving</a>. Whoop de freaking doo. That’s what language does, right? Maybe it’s annoying to prescriptivists (like a lot of other things), but what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Well, concept creep has consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to Nick Haslam’s concerns above about pathologizing the everyday, I also find myself frustrated by the difficulty concept creep poses to communication. Where those terms once held some utility in talking with others, I find more often than not that when I’m attempting to problem-solve relationship issues with an individual that I absolutely cannot take any of that at face value. If they say that their partner is gaslighting them or they tell me that their ex was a narcissist, that ends up being <em>incredibly</em> low-yield information. Instead of learning anything important from those descriptors, I find myself expending considerable energy in followup questions, uncovering exactly what they think those words mean. What happened? What behaviors are we talking about?</p>
<p>Where several years ago, I was much more likely to have the individual describe the actual behavior at default, it’s more likely these days for people to start using labels instead as a shortcut. And ones they are often not applying correctly.</p>
<p>To be fair, there’s always going to be a place for that kind of followup in the helping professions. And people are generally unreliable narrators, incredibly biased and subjective sources of information, something you basically always have to keep in mind when you’re working with them and talking over complex social issues with them.</p>
<p>But concept creep really does seem to have gotten worse in recent years.</p>

  		<p>At around this time last year, I was being flooded with various articles on new year's resolutions and yearly summaries - as is typical in early January. I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my 'roadmap to becoming a better human' google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I'm making <em>most</em> of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year's resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<h4>You did what!?</h4>
<p>I logged my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<p>Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just "Life"):</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/spreadsheet_banner.png" alt="A screenshot of a google sheet I used to track my data with different activities coloured differently" title="Life"></p>
<h3>Why would you do this!?</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn't sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into <em>quality</em> time.</p>
<p>It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p>
<h3>Ok, sure, whatever. How much effort did this take?</h3>
<p>Not that much actually!</p>
<p>When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p>
<h4>Technicalities</h4>
<p><a href="#data">I don't care, I want to see the data.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn't want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</li>
<li>I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBUFCJGVL73kFvD0yO5e63fLfRuebemcqhnQoafXad4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.
For me, the categories were:
<ul>
<li><strong>sleeping:</strong></li>
<li><strong>focused work</strong> - what I really understand as productivity:
<ul>
<li><strong>uni</strong> - university (until June) and PhD (since October)</li>
<li><strong>self-improvement</strong> - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</li>
<li><strong>organising</strong> - things like organising events for a society, conferences and other extracurricular things</li>
<li><strong>German</strong> - to track language learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>low-focus work</strong> - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn't require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</li>
<li><strong>socialising</strong></li>
<li><strong>culture</strong> (with subcategories: <strong>books</strong>, <strong>films</strong>, <strong>documentaries</strong>, <strong>TV shows</strong>, and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>human function</strong> - the boring stuff I need to do to stay alive (showering, making food, eating and things like that. On trips also setting tents etc)</li>
<li><strong>other quality time</strong> - things that didn't really fit into the other categories. Subcategories: <strong>blogs</strong>, <strong>podcasts</strong>, <strong>news</strong>, <strong>games</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>chilling</strong> (for the times when I needed to just lie down or stare at the wall), and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>travelling</strong> - time spent in buses/cars/planes etc</li>
<li><strong>exercising</strong> - deliberate exercise - running, cycling, exercise routines</li>
<li><strong>exercising (lower intensity)</strong> - mostly walking/slow cycling, but also stretching</li>
<li><strong>procrastinating</strong> - mostly social media</li>
<li><strong>idle</strong> - waiting in queues etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let's use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p>
<h4>What did I do in 2020?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/year_props.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time in total I spent on different activities"></p>
<p>Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I'm very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can't decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.
The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p>
<p>Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as 'extra days' on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn't spend them on human function.</p>
<p>Some of the categories from the plot above were divided into more helpful subcategories:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/High_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within focused work">
<img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Low_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within low-focus work"></p>
<p>By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p>
<p>Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a <em>lot</em> of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/culture.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within culture"></p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I'm quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads<sup id="fnref1">
<a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can't really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the 'documentaries' are really just Louis Theroux and I don't regret a single minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Quality.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within quality time" title="Other quality time subcategories"></p>
<h4>How did the time spent on different activities change over the months?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/hrs_per_month_timeline.png" alt="A stacked plot showing how the average daily hours spent on different activities changed throughout the months"></p>
<p>As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can quite clearly identify the 'hard lockdown' times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master's thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p>

<h4>Hacking my monkey brain to increase productivity</h4>
<p>As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.
Inspired by <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">this post</a> I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.
I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun <em>now</em> and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.
Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</li>
<li>3 points for reading books</li>
<li>2 points for reading blogs, listening to podcasts, lower intensity work etc</li>
<li>0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</li>
<li>-4 points for procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are my points for this year:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points.png" alt="A calendar with days coloured according to the amounts of points I got on a given day"></p>
<p>and their distributions throughout the months:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points_per_month.png" alt="A plot of the distributions of points throughout the months"></p>
<p>Turns out my monkey brain is <text><strong>crazy</strong> </text> about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, …</p></article></div>

source code on laptops. Development happens strictly on workstations inside
their private networks, with some using their text editor’s support for
remote file editing and others running editors on those machines via SSH.</p><p>Adapting to this situation has indirectly led me into a bit of a rabbit
hole, forcing me to acknowledge my core values, better understand the
relation between progress and human flourishing, and ponder about the
question: why technology?</p><p><em>(Chapters are mostly self-contained.)</em></p><h3 id="the-computing-experience">The computing experience</h3><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 3: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 3: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p><h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><h3 id="searching-files">Searching files</h3><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root
for a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if
the buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it
return <code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote
buffers.</p><p>Emacs</p></div></div>

Anyone with a reference to the original can always count on it being the same.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>my-vector</code></pre><p><code>conj</code> returns a new vector with the arguments appended.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-new-vector <span>(</span><span>conj</span> my-vector <span>"four"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>my-new-vector<br></code></pre><p>The original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector<br></code></pre><p>Functions like <code>reverse</code> return a new vector, rather than mutating the original.</p><pre><code><span>const</span> myArray <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>"two"</span><span>,</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>myArray<span>.</span><span>reverse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>myArray</p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>reverse</span> my-vector<span>)</span><br></code></pre><p>Our original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector</code></pre><p>This encourages us to use compositions of functions instead of functions that mutate objects. The benefit of this might not be immediately obvious, but this shift encourages writing programs in a way that's simpler. Programs made up of small reusable components are easier to change later. We just need to focus on the scope of the function, the inputs, and the outputs. We don't need to worry about prior state.</p><p>The first thing you will notice in Clojure is how many parens there are and how dense the code is. It takes some getting used to, but the parens have a lot of benefits.</p><p>We can always rewrite syntax repetition with macros and there are plenty of techniques for reducing the number of parens including "threading" operators like <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>. The following is equivalent to the header.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span> but<br>     there<br>     are<br>     so<br>     many<br>     parens<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Function calls are different in Clojure than most languages. It is represented by a list where the first element is the function and the rest are the arguments to that function.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> arg1 arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>The syntax is extremely regular. It's natural to wrap a function in another function.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>my-function <span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span> <span>"third"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span>my-if <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span><span>(</span><span>arg1<span>,</span> arg2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>arg1<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg1<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg2<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>not</span> <span>(</span>blank? arg1<span>)</span><span>)</span><br>     arg1<br>     arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted or use a transpiler but in Clojure it could by implemented by anyone as a library.</p><pre><code>messages <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><br><span>go</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> messages <span>&lt;-</span> <span>"ping"</span> <span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>msg <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;-</span>messages<br>fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span>def c <span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>go</span> <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>!</span> c <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>!</span> c<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Clojure is really good at extracting data from maps and sequences. It is a really good for "data programs", that are mostly calling an API, transforming a sequence, and calling another API.</p><h2>Positional Destructuring</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> large-list '<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>]</span> large-list<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2>Destructuring with named optional parameters and defaults</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> configure <span>[</span><span>val</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span><span>:keys</span> <span>[</span>debug verbose<span>]</span><br>       <span>:or</span> <span>{</span>debug <span>false</span><span>,</span> verbose <span>false</span><span>}</span><span>}</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>"val="</span> <span>val</span> <span>" debug="</span>debug <span>" verbose="</span>verbose<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>configure <span>"foo!"</span> <span>{</span><span>:debug</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Having a fast feedback loop is crucial to be productive. When I first started programming I would write some code, compile, then manually test my changes, maybe with a debugger. Then I discovered TDD with an auto test runner, which gave me a faster feedback loop, since I could be reasonably confident my program worked without having to recompile for every change. The fastest feedback loop I've discovered so far is the Clojure REPL with editor integration. With Emacs and CIDER I can execute code in my editor as I write it. Having a fast feedback loop for exploratory coding before writing tests helps me be a lot more productive and write higher quality code. Other languages also have REPLs but I feel Clojure is uniquely well suited to this workflow because of its immutable functional nature.</p><p>Testing is simpler when most things are maps and pure functions. This is an example from the "Gilded Rose Kata".</p><pre><code>    <span>@Test</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span><br>        <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span> qualityControl <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>shouldNeverIncreaseQualityToMoreThanFifty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>Item</span> backstagePass <span>=</span> <span>anItem</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>withName</span><span>(</span>BACKSTAGE_PASS_ITEM_NAME<span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setSellIn</span><span>(</span>FIVE_DAYS<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setQuality</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        qualityControl<span>.</span><span>updateQualityFor</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        <span>assertThat</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>.</span><span>getQuality</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>is</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> max-quality-pass<br>  <span>{</span><span>:quality</span> <span>50</span><br>   <span>:sell-in</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><p> <span>(</span>deftest test-backstage-pass-peak<br>  <span>(</span>testing <span>"Quality never goes over 50"</span><br>    <span>(</span>is <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>50</span> <span>(</span><span>:quality</span> <span>(</span>i/update-item max-quality-pass<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Clojure has good interop with the worlds most popular languages. You can tap into the Java ecosystem for foundational libraries like the AWS SDK or database clients. Clojurescript has an excellent wrapper around React called Reagent. You can write your entire stack in Clojure, meaning a single person can be extremely productive. The interop story isn't perfect though: although it works technically, the difference between the programming models does have some friction. This can usually be solved by writing a wrapper.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>System/getProperty <span>"java.vm.version"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now that Moore's Law is ending, we can't rely on speed increases of a single core anymore. We need to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and that can correctly run in parallel. I don't feel good about using some languages like Python or Javascript that are single inherently single threaded. Languages like Java or C++, which weren't designed with concurrency in mind are hard to use correctly. Clojure's data structures are thread safe by default and it has numerous concurrency primitives. The language design de-emphasis the us of state and emphasizes the use of values instead.</p><p>I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. If you use types you have to consider their downsides and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program. After using Clojure, I find things like the "builder pattern" contrived. There is usually only a few types of true "data" and the rest of the program are subsets and combinations of the data, which don't always deserve an explicit name or type. I feel using languages that encourage classes encourages you to make abstractions too early, and making the wrong abstraction is much worse than repetition. A lot of the "bugs" you catch at compile time are often self inflicted bookeeping mistakes due to the increased complexity. I think testing is a much stronger form of software validation and will catch the errors that types would have.</p><p>The design choices and tradeoffs in Clojure were made deliberately. There are much fewer sharp edges and historical accidents in Clojure than any other language I've used. Clojure is opinionated on the way you write software but if you buy into that opinion, using pure functions and immutable data structures, the experience is very streamlined.</p><p>I remember having to learn the difference between comparing primitives and objects in Java. Code like this feels unintuitive.</p><h2>Equality</h2><pre><code><span>Integer</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>Integer</span> b <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a <span>==</span> b<span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Comparing object equality is almost never what I want to do and I don't think it's a good default behavior.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>===</span> <span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This does what I expect, and I don't need to know the difference between <code>=</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>deepEqual</code>, and <code>deepStrictEqual</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is only <code>=</code> for structural equality and no assignment operator.

              <p>I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. Often they result in conflicts and people being offended by others' behavior.</p><p>Some people take action and implement their idea. Act fast, fail fast, and learn quicker. But this doesn't work when two or more people discuss how to implement a change or use new hyped technology. When people only talk a bit and implement a new hype, it often ends up with resentment. When we act and embrace failing that fast, we cannot keep someone accountable.</p><p>On the other hand, some people try to get everyone's confirmation to implement something that affects a large group. This strategy doesn't work either. Because it's impossible to get everyone on the same page, each person has a different opinion. When we try convincing everyone, we cannot implement anything at all. We just talk, and decisions come later than we need.</p><p>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process. I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called <strong>Request For Comments (RFC). </strong>It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language.</p><p>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has <strong>a specific timeframe</strong> and <strong>everyone can give feedback</strong> on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted <strong>publicly</strong>. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.</p><p>While the initial goal of the RFC is collecting feedback, I think it achieves a way more significant benefit by only <strong>writing the document itself</strong>. Writing shapes thoughts. Everyone has an opinion on any topic. But people who write their ideas form them into great content that is based on the facts.</p><p>Writing helps to clear the mind. When we write on any topic, we separate our proposal from ourselves. It's still part of us. But since we plan to present it to the public and leave it there forever, we start being careful. And most of the time, we are not starting with blank white paper.</p><p>The RFC processes use either a template or follow one standard style in documents. The aim is to help the authors to explain their plan in a structured way and, at the same time, make giving feedback easier. Each section of the document has its own goal, which helps separate the intent from the idea in a certain way.</p><p>We used <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/educ303x/wiki-old/uploads/Main/SRI_NABC.doc">the NABC model from Stanford</a>. The model starts with defining the <em><strong>N</strong></em>eed, followed by <em><strong>A</strong></em>pproach, <em><strong>B</strong></em>enefits, and lastly, <em><strong>C</strong></em>ompetitors. Separating the Need from the Approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages. Since most people focus on them when they talk about ideas, it's also easy to write. Then the competition section comes. It is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it's not the only one.</p><p>Everyone has different needs. Therefore the formats might differ. Our manager at work also came up with a way more straightforward structure with only four questions to answer. It was only for our team, while the engineering department had the RFC process for a wider audience.</p><p>The RFCs have another effect on the organization. The process seeks a <strong>consent-based </strong>environment,<strong> not a consensus-based </strong>one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.</p><p>The process brings <strong>accountability</strong>, as well. Whoever writes the proposal should be kept accountable. When people know that they will be accountable, they tend to approach more carefully and consider different aspects seriously. Holding someone accountable doesn't mean that there will be a blame in case of failure. It only means that they have to follow up on their proposals, make sure it results in some way, and answer questions on the way. Also, most of the time, the RFC process is separated from the implementation process. While the author is accountable for the RFC itself, the implementation can be done by different people, and the RFC author might not be involved in it at all.</p><p>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates. The culture changes with it as well. Instead of endless debates, we create discussions and solutions based on facts. The process prevents people from talking and doing nothing. Even though the RFC process might not be perfect itself, writing is enough to halt the endless and meaningless discussions. It also helps build trust in the community. So, if you are new to the RFC system, start with writing down your proposal. I'm pretty sure that the result will be way better than expected.</p><hr><p>Check out the comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149">HackerNews</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@30daysreplay">30daysreplay Marketingberatung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <h2 id="what-does-varlink-provide">What does varlink provide?</h2>

<p>Everybody understands it. Varlink uses a simple human and machine readable <a href="https://varlink.org/#interface">text file</a> to
describe an interface with all its data types, method calls and errors. The text file, in its simplicity,
does not require any specific knowledge to join a discussion about design, development, and
maintenance of an API.</p>

<p>It documents itself, in the sources and on the wire. Varlink interfaces describe themselves readable to
humans and reliably consumable by machines. Varlink services are introspectable at runtime. Varlink
interfaces provide their documentation along with the interface description.</p>

<p>Everything is readable. Varlink uses plain text messages, has no magic numbers, no unnamed values, is
easily debuggable with things like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>,
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>

<p>Varlink itself is simpler than the service that uses it. Varlink uses direct connections, has no
central message handling component, it is easily debugged, secured, isolated, tested.</p>

<h2 id="which-transports-can-be-used-to-speak-varlink">Which transports can be used to speak varlink?</h2>

<p>Varlink can be implemented on any connection-oriented transport.The most common example are streaming
sockets, but it can also be implemented on kernel special files like device nodes or encapsulated in
other protocols, like HTTP, GSS-API or SASL.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-monitor-changes-or-subscribe-to-signals">How can I monitor changes or subscribe to signals?</h2>

<p>Varlink connections can be turned into monitor connections, they are soft-negotiated between the
client and the service. The client asks the server to possibly reply with more than one reply, the
server replies and indicates that it might have more replies and the client should wait for them.</p>

<p>To avoid race conditions between the reading of the current state and subscribing to updates, a
typical varlink monitor method call first returns the current state and then sends changes in
subsequent replies to the same request on the same connection.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-sequence-numbers-in-calls-and-replies">Why are there no sequence numbers in calls and replies?</h2>

<p>Varlink operates on connections, all messages are strictly in order on the same connection and always
received in the order they are sent. Connections support message pipelining, but not multiplexing.
Complex interfaces can use multiple connections at the same time.</p>



<p>The varlink message <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> can be extended by vendors if needed. Added keys should use
the reverse-domain notation including the vendor’s name. The concept is similar to the X-prefix used for
HTTP headers, but neither they nor naked keywords should be added by vendors, since they may clash with
other vendors or future varlink protocol specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-records-separated-by-a-nul-character-and-do-not-specify-a-length">Why are records separated by a NUL character and do not specify a length?</h2>

<p>The simplest possible transport of varlink messages is a raw streaming socket, which forwards JSON
records separated by a NUL character. Conceptually the NUL character belongs to the transport not to
the varlink message. If varlink messages are encapsulated in HTTP, HTTP will specify the record length
and not use a NUL byte.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-unsigned-integers-and-why-are-there-no-integer-sizes-specified">Why are there no unsigned integers, and why are there no integer sizes specified?</h2>

<p>Like JSON, varlink is intentionally underspecified in this regard. The implementation should use
integers large enough to carry the signed integer value, and return an error if it cannot handle the
received number.</p>

<h2 id="the-varlink-type-system-specifies-features-which-do-not-directly-map-to-json-how-are-they-serialized">The varlink type system specifies features which do not directly map to JSON, how are they serialized?</h2>

<p><a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Enums</a> are serialized as a JSON name/value pair, with the enum value as a
string. <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Maps</a> are serialized as JSON objects, every map element is
represented as a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-transmit-file-descriptors">Can I transmit file descriptors?</h2>

<p>Varlink intentionally does not support features or side-effects specific to transports. Encapsulating
varlink messages in other protocols, passing them over proxies is a requirement of varlink.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-reference-a-file">How can I reference a file?</h2>

<p>Varlink should be remotable, therefore you should not point a remote service to a file, which is local
to the client. Just send the content and an identifier/name of the file.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-transfer-larger-amounts-or-foreign-data">How can I transfer larger amounts or foreign data?</h2>

<p>You can either send the data as a string, or use the “upgraded” connection feature, where you opt-out
of the varlink protocol after calling a method with the <code>upgrade</code> <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> field set
to <code>true</code>. After sending this message the connection is yours for sending whatever you want. To
speak the varlink protocol to the service again, you need to open a new connection. Upgraded varlink
connections are similar to the websocket concept.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-a-oneway-request-useful">When is a <code>oneway</code> request useful?</h2>

<p>Setting <code>oneway</code> in a <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">method call</a> means that the service will not send a reply. This
might be useful when many messages are sent as part of one transaction, and only one single reply is
needed to confirm the transaction. It might also be useful for non-critical data like a debugging
interface, to minimize round-trip handling.</p>

<p>The most important reason to add this feature right from the start is, that it could not be added to
the protocol at a later time, because all implementations need to support it right away to correctly
handle the strict message ordering requirement.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-error-numbers-or-human-readable-messages-in-errors">Why are there no error numbers or human readable messages in errors?</h2>

<p>Varlink errors are interface-specific and identified by a string. If required, Interfaces could add a
<code>message</code> field to the error parameters which contain human readable text. The primary focus of
varlink errors is machine consumption, in most cases a carefully chosen descriptive CamelCase error
sufficiently describes the error to humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-service-which-implements-a-local-interface">How do I find the service which implements a local interface?</h2>

<p>On systems with the <code>org.varlink.resolver</code> interface reachable on a defined varlink URI, the
client can call the <code>method org.varlink.resolver.Resolve(interface: string) -&gt; (address: string)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-varlink-services-accessed-from-a-remote-machine">How are varlink services accessed from a remote machine?</h2>

<p>The varlink command line tool, as well as some varlink language bindings offer the possibility to
connect to a service via a <code>bridge</code>.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Python:
<a href="https://varlink.org/python/#varlink.Client.new_with_bridge">varlink.Client.new_with_bridge()</a></li>
  <li>Rust:
<a href="https://docs.rs/varlink/4.0.0/varlink/struct.Connection.html#method.with_bridge">Connection::with_bridge()</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge command normally is <code>ssh &lt;host&gt; varlink bridge</code>, calling <code>varlink bridge</code> on the
remote host. The <code>varlink bridge</code> command parses all method calls on stdin, queries the
<code>org.varlink.resolver</code> on the remote system for the interface address, connects to this address
and forwards all method calls matching the interface name to the local service on the remote machine.
It reads the replies and passes them back to stdout. Instead of <code>ssh</code> any other connection command
 could be used. Instead of <code>varlink bridge</code> any other utility, which offers an equal
 functionality, could be used.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-version-number-of-an-interface">How can I get the version number of an interface?</h2>

<p>Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a feature set described in detail by
the interface definition, which is part of the wire protocol.</p>

<p>If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only extend it, never remove or
incompatibly change things which might be already in use. Clients can fully introspect a service and
figure out which features the interface supports; this is more expressive than any simple numbering
scheme. If you break the API or remove stuff, just release it with a new name, commonly done by adding
a number to the interface name, like <code>org.example.interface2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-extend-an-interface-in-a-backwards-compatible-way">How do I extend an interface in a backwards compatible way?</h2>

<p>Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in its interface definition or on the
 wire, all parameters are identified by their name and can be extended later.</p>

<p>Things like this are not needed:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
       /* … */
       /*
        * Reserved space to allow possible future extensions without
        * breaking the ABI. You should not touch these, because the
        * names of these variables may change.
        */
       uint32_t reserved_int1;
       uint32_t reserved_int2;
       uint32_t reserved_int3;
       uint32_t reserved_int4;
} my_service_struct_foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields (nullable type, maybe). The result of
the methods, when passed parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected behavior for omitted
fields/parameters should be documented. Removing fields, types, errors or methods are not backward
compatible and should be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-socket-activation-work">How does socket activation work?</h2>

<p>Varlink language bindings commonly implement the systemd socket activation protocol. The environment
of the started service will be augmented with the variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_NAMES, LISTEN_PID.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-implement-exit-on-idle-for-my-service">How do I implement exit-on-idle for my service?</h2>

<p>Services can be started on-demand with socket activation. When there is no background task running and
no clients connected to the service, the service can decide to close the listening socket and exit. A
new connection from a client will activate the service again. Because varlink is strictly
point-to-point, there is no buffering involved and the service activator will queue all incoming
messages, exit-on-idle can be implemented in a race-free manner.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-restrict-the-access-to-my-service">How can I restrict the access to my service?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method is to rely on the permissions of a UNIX socket in the file system.
Services which need a more fine-grained access control can check the connection credentials of a unix
socket and decide per call if they want to act on behalf of the client.
If varlink would be wrapped in GSS-API, e.g. kerberos tickets could be used for more fine grained
access control.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this chapter we will introduce simple but useful basic widgets and explain the
widgets which we introduced earlier in more detail. All these widgets are really easy
to use. We have constructor functions with names which starts with "new" like
newButton(), we can add these widgets to containers, and connect them directly to
signals or map them to GActions. You should also study the C API documentation of
these simple widgets to learn about all the other functionality that is also
available, like provided functions, available signals or widget properties.  Remember
that GTK widgets build a class hierarchy so functionality may be provided by parent
classes.  For example the GtkCheckButton is a subclass of GtkToggleButton and both
are of course widgets, so you may have to consult all that API documentation to find
functions or properties that you may desire. Also consider using the devhelp tool to
navigate the C API docs. For the more advanced and complicated widgets like
GtkTreeView, GtkListView and GtkDrawingArea we will give only minimal examples in
this chapter to give you a basic feeling what they are and how they can be used.
GtkTreeView and GtkListView are powerfull widgets to display larger textual and other
data sets. And the GtkDrawingArea is a widget where we can draw arbitrary two
dimensional graphics by using drawing functions of the cairo graphics library. We can
use the GtkDrawingArea for pure display purpose, or we can combine it with user input
activities to create advanced CAD tools. One more advanced GTK widget is the
GtkGLArea which can be used to display three-dimensional OpenGL graphics.  But as
creating graphics with OpenGL is a wide area for which many whole books have been
written, we will not try to cover that topic in this book.</p>
<p>The GTK widgets can be grouped into container widgets which arrange other widgets
like GtkBox or GtkGrid, into mostly passive widgets for displaying data like the
GtkLabel, and into the active widgets which accept user input like GtkEntry. For an
overview you may visit the widget gallery page:</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_label">Label</h3>
<p>The GtkLabel is a simple widget that can display some text. The text can have
multiple lines when desired, can wrap automatically and can support style attributes
like italic or boldface. The label widget is mostly used to label other widgets or to
display some textual messages to the user.  GtkButtons use a label widgets to display
its text.  For the actual text display the pango library is used, which supports many
advanced text renderings like right to left text and many attributes like
strike-though, underline, overline (since pango v 1.46) and many more.  GtkLabels
like all GTK widgets support utf8 unicode text which allows display of glyphs of
exotic languages as well as a large range of symbols.</p>
<p>The GtkLabel is one of the simplest GTK widgets and the C API documentation should be
easy to understand and can be used in Nim straight forward:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_properties">Properties</h4>
<p>GTK uses the concept of properties to set or modify the internal state of GTK widgets
or other entities.  For most properties GTK offers setter and getter functions which
we use when available, so we have not to deal with properties that often. But in some
cases it is necessary, so we will introduce the basics at this point already. GTK
properties have textual names like "wrap" or "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and
a typed state like boolean true/false, integer states or states of other types. In C
code most often the function g_object_set() is used to set one or multiple
properties. That function uses multiple untyped arguments. As it is not type safe it
is not provided by gobject-introspection and is not available in most high level GTK
bindings including Nim. Instead we use g_object_set_property() called just
setProperty() to set single properties in Nim.  Unfortunately that procedure needs a
GValue as third parameter which makes it use a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The following example program defines a helper procedure called toBoolVal() to create
a GValue with matching type and content from a Nim bool value. We use the resulting
GValue to set the wrap property of our label and the
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" property of our whole application. Both
properties expects a boolean GValue.</p>

<p>In our toBoolVal() proc we have to create a GType variable first. For this we can use
the typeFromName() proc to which we have to pass the correct GTK type name, or with
recent gintro versions we could use getType() procs like gBooleanGetType() directly.
Guessing the right name is not always easy — for string types we would have to use
gStringGetType() or typeFromName("gchararray"). With that GType we can first init() a
GValue variable and then set its value. GValues are used a lot in gtkListView and
GtkThreeView widgets, we will learn more about GTypes the GValue variables later when
we explain these widgets.  In the above example program we use the function
setProperty() two times. First we set the property
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" for our whole application to true. To do that we
query the default settings with a call of getDefaultSettings() and then set that
boolean value. The result is that our whole app uses a dark color scheme when
available. The second use of setProperty(), again for a boolean variable, is to set
the "wrap" property of one of our label widgets. For this the label class provides
the function setWrap() which we generally would use. We used a GtkBox to arrange our
two labels vertically in our window. We will learn more details about the GtkBox
containers in the next section.</p>
<p>While GtkLabels are most of the time passive entities, they provide some signals like
"activate-link" and "move-cursor".  By default label text can not be copied to the
clipboard, but we can call setSelectable() on a label widget to make it selectable.
Then we can click with the mouse on the text, we can select all or part of the text
and the label widget will get a popup menu which pops up when we press the right
mouse button allowing to select and copy the label text to the clipboard. This can be
useful when a label displays messages which we may want to copy elsewhere.  One of
the many useful functions offered by labels is setEllipsize() which determines how
text not fitting into the available are is handled. That function is often used in
conjunction with setMaxWidhChars() or setWidhChars().  Our second example program
below displays some chess pieces using utf8 unicode glyphs, and an ordinary text
which is displayed in a small font and which is shortened by showing ellipsis when
the enclosing window is small. The label widget with the chess pieces is made
selectable, so you can copy the content into another window, maybe into an instance
of the the gedit text editor.</p>

<p>In both label texts we use html tags like &lt;big&gt; or &lt;small&gt; to modify the text
display. Currently we have to additional call setUseMarkup() on the label to tell it
that html tags should be used. We may expect that for the case that we use
setMarkup() that should be not necessary — maybe it is a bug of early GTK&nbsp;4
release? Modifying the label display with enclosed tags directly is convenient, but
restricted to only a few attributes. In the next section we will lean how we can use
XML UI files to do more advanced text customization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_gtklabels_and_xml_ui_files">GtkLabels and XML UI files</h4>
<p>Earlier in this book we used already XML files to describe the structure of popup
menus.  And we said at the beginning of the book that GTK allows to declare the whole
GUI or parts of it with XML UI files which is then loaded by the GTK builder. Below
you can see such an XML UI file which describes a label and two buttons, which are
arranged into a GtkGrid widget.</p>

    <div><p>A colleague of mine has repeatedly called for some of the controllers in our project to be refactored. He says they're messy, but what I think he means is that they're hard to understand. At first glance they do seem complex yes but upon closer inspection:</p><ul>
<li>There are step-by-step instructions in the comments explaining what's going on.</li>
<li>Variable and method names are descriptive but not overly verbose.</li>
<li>The code is spaced, formatted and indented correctly.</li>
</ul><p>I can see why my colleague might see the code this way; it does have multiple concerns, but it came to be this way iteratively over the course of two years. Everything it does relates to a previously-defined requirement i.e. it does what it's supposed to. We also haven't made any changes to it for several months because it hasn't caused any bugs nor are there any major performance bottlenecks.</p><p>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. You've never heard anyone say the phrase "legacy code" without contempt in their tone. I <i>can</i> appreciate that sometimes old code doesn't conform to newer practices agreed on by a team. For example, legacy PHP code might use the now-deprecated PSR-2 standard, but the tech lead might want everyone to write PSR-12. But is this really a good enough reason to potentially jeopardise a piece of working functionality?</p><p>I think the reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember. Developers yearn for clarity but if they're not immediately able to recall <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/building-software-sharing-knowledge" target="_blank">under what circumstances some code was written</a> (in a few seconds or less), they only see ambiguity.</p><div id="posthaven_gallery[1659795]">

<p>Even when we talk about code, when we're able to recall previous conversations/decisions/motivations quickly, we can talk about it confidently and convey to others that we understand it well. Unfortunately saying, "I need five to ten minutes to refresh my memory of this" doesn't convey the same sense of confidence. (Always prepare.)</p><p>Part of the solution to reducing this "time to recall" is through better internal documentation, ideally right alongside your code. We use a tool like <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank">Codestream</a> but I'll admit that not all context is captured. In my opinion, good old-fashioned comments work best. I try to write mine like a numbered set of instructions. Of course you can also convey meaning with git commits.</p><p>The other part of the solution is to agree as a team under what circumstances code should be refactored.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-ratio-heatmap.png" alt="Compressed bytes divided by original bytes, always less than 30%">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-headline-figures.png" alt="Savings from compressing logs as they enter the logging pipeline, several thousand dollars a month">

<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

<a href="#stage-0-deepstream-baseline">#</a></h2><p>To recap, we got peak throughput with the DeepStream pipeline by using a hybrid model — a TensorRT-optimized SSD300 front-end with postprocessing code running in TorchScript in the libtorch runtime. All processing on GPU, of course. Here’s a reminder of some of the throughput milestones from the last article:</p><p>Why did we need TorchScript? Several common object-detection postprocessing operations — including thresholding and non-max-suppression (NMS) — can’t be seamlessly exported from Pytorch to ONNX and compiled with TensorRT. Leaving these operations in TorchScript allowed us to get great performance without rewriting any model code or creating TensorRT plugins.</p><p>Looking at the performance trace from Nsight Systems, we can see the TorchScript postprocessing comes in just under 10 ms. When we compiled the inference step with TensorRT we saw around 43 ms of TorchScript turn into about 16 ms equivalent processing — so anything executing in TorchScript seems ripe for optimization.</p><p>Here’s what it looked like in Nsight Systems:</p><a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch.png"><figure><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_489589_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520"><figcaption><small></small></figcaption></figure></a><p>Let’s eliminate the TorchScript postprocessing and get the entire model running end-to-end in TensorRT.</p><h2 id="stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">Stage 1: End-to-End TensorRT
<a href="#stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">#</a></h2><p>The baseline Pytorch SSD300 model (including postprocessing) cannot be easily compiled with TensorRT for several reasons, all of which involve missing (or impossible) support for tensor operations:</p><ul><li><p>Subscripted tensor assignment results in <code>ScatterND</code> (indexed assignment) nodes in ONNX.</p></li><li><p>Score thresholding uses a mask operation, which cannot be expressed in the fixed-dimension world of TensorRT.</p></li><li><p>Torchvision’s batched non-max suppression (NMS) operation has no exact equivalent in TensorRT.</p></li></ul><p>We can fix the first by tweaking model code and re-exporting to ONNX, but to fix the other issues we’ll have to modify the ONNX computational graph — replacing these operations with a TensorRT plugin.</p><h3 id="11-rewriting-subscripted-tensor-assignment">1.1 Rewriting Subscripted Tensor Assignment

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

  <article>
	<header>
		
		<time date="2020-12-22">December 2020</time>
	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, someone with the handle “entha_saava” posted this question on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23791152">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone knowledgeable explain how are lisp REPLs different from
Python / Ruby REPLs? What is the differentiating point of REPL
driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is that there is a <a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/2020/02/03/programming-as-teaching.html">particular kind of programming</a>
in which you build a program by <em>interacting</em> with it as it runs, and
there are certain languages and runtimes that are designed from the
ground up to support that kind of programming.</p>
<p>Python and Ruby are not examples of such languages.</p>
<p>Why not? That’s the crux of entha_saava’s question, right? What are
these <strong>repl-driven</strong> programming systems, and what makes them
different from Python and Ruby and every other language that offers a
repl?</p>
<p>For that matter, what’s a repl?</p>
<p>The word <strong>repl</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>read-eval-print
loop</strong>. The term comes from the history of Lisp. From the start, sixty
years ago, the standard way of working with a Lisp has been to start a
language processor, type expressions at its prompt, and wait for it to
evaluate the expressions and print their results, before prompting for
another expression. Read, eval, print. Loop.</p>
<p>Nowadays, repls are all the rage. Every language and its brother
offers a repl. There’s a website, <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>, whose
entire purpose is to provide all the repls.</p>
<p>It doesn’t actually provide <em>all</em> the repls, of course. What’s
particularly ironic is that it doesn’t provide either of the canonical
repl-driven development environments: Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>That brings us back to entha_saava’s question: if Common Lisp and
Smalltalk are repl-driven environments, and Python and Ruby are not,
what’s the difference? What do Lisp and Smalltalk have that Python and
Ruby don’t?</p>
<p>What they have is a language and runtime system that are designed from
the ground up with the assumption that you’re going to develop
programs by starting the language engine and talking to it, teaching
it how to be your program <em>interactively</em>, by changing it <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>I can hear the objections formulating already. I’ve seen them
before. Yes, every language with a repl can do some things in the
repl. Obviously that’s true; if it weren’t, then the repl would be
entirely useless.</p>
<p>Being able to do <em>some</em> things in the repl does not make an engine
into a repl-driven programming environment. What distinguishes
old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk environments is that you can do
<em>everything</em> in the repl. They place no gratuitous limitations on what
you can do; if the language and runtime can do it, then the repl can
do it.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask the current version of Clozure Common Lisp to
rebuild itself from scratch by evaluating the following expression at
the repl prompt:</p>
<pre><code>(rebuild-ccl :full t)
</code></pre>
<p>CCL responds by completely rebuilding itself from source.</p>
<p>The point is not that you would want to rebuild CCL this way all the
time. The point is that there are no artificial limitations on what
the repl can do. The full range of the development system’s
capabilities is accessible from the repl.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things I notice when using newer, lesser
repls: I’m always running into things I can’t do from the repl.</p>
<p>It’s not just about freedom from restrictions, though. Proper support
for interactive programming means that the language and its runtime
have positive features that support changing your program <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, <code>foo</code>, that calls some other function, <code>bar</code>, that
is not yet defined. Now call <code>foo</code>. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to <code>foo</code> breaks, because <code>bar</code> is not defined. But
what happens when it breaks? What happens next?</p>
<p>If your favorite repl is Python’s or Ruby’s or any of a few dozen
other modern repls, the answer is most likely that it prints an error
message and returns to its prompt. In some cases, perhaps it crashes.</p>
<p>So what’s my point, right? What else could it do?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the “differentiating point” of
repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk
environment, the break in <code>foo</code> drops you into a <strong>breakloop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakloop</strong> is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the
tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment
of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down
the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically
visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data
in the running program.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can <em>edit</em> all live data in the program. If you think
that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable
or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended
function. If it now works correctly, then congratulations; you found
the problem!</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are
available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing
function <code>bar</code>, resume <code>foo</code>, and get a sensible result.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a style of programming, well known in Lisp and
Smalltalk circles, in which you define a toplevel function with calls
to other functions that don’t yet exist, and then define those
functions as you go in the resulting breakloops. It’s a fast way to
implement a procedure when you already know how it should work.</p>
<p>If you’re a user of old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk systems then this
all sounds obvious to you, but that reaction is not common. Surprise
is much more common, or even suspicion: what’s the catch?</p>
<p>The catch is that the designers of your language system had to think
that facility through in the planning stages. You don’t get a decent
implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need
<em>full</em> access to the <em>entire</em> development system, interactively, with
a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s
environment.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example of a facility designed to support
interactive programming. Once again, try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a datatype. I mean a class, a struct, a record type–whatever
user-defined type your favorite language supports. Make some instances
of it. Write some functions (or methods, or procedures, or whatever)
to operate on them.</p>
<p>Now change the definition of the type. What happens?</p>
<p>Does your language runtime notice that the definition of the type has
changed? Does it realize that the existing instances have a new
definition? When something touches one of them, does it automatically
reinitialize it to conform to the new definition, or, if it doesn’t
know how to do that, does it start a breakloop and ask you what to do
about it?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” then you’re probably using a Lisp or Smalltalk
system. If the answer is “no,” then you’re missing a crucial element
of repl-driven development.</p>
<p>Remember: the point is to support programming <em>interactively</em>. You
don’t want to have to kill your program and rebuild it from scratch
just because you changed a definition. That’s silly; adding and
changing definitions is most of what you do! If your development
environment is going to support interactive development, then it had
better know how to keep your program running when you change some
definitions.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk system know how to do that. There are
also a few other kinds of systems, mostly older ones, that know how to
do it.</p>
<p>These are not eccentric new ideas out of left field. They’ve been
around for half a century. They contribute materially to productivity
in interactive development.</p>
<p>They’re what sets <strong>repl-driven development</strong> apart from mere
development with a repl.</p>
<p>Now, not every programmer prefers that kind of development. Some
programmers prefer to think of development as a process of designing,
planning, making blueprints, and assembling parts on a
workbench. There’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, a
multibillion-dollar international industry has been built upon it.</p>
<p>But if you prefer interactive development, if it’s more natural to
you, then it can make you enormously more productive, not to mention
happier in your work.</p>
<p>Interactive development with a proper repl-driven environment is the
exception. Most programming is done in other ways.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there are a lot of programmers out there who’ve
never even heard of it, who have no idea that it exists. My intuition
is that some fraction of those programmers would prefer well-supported
interactive programming, and would benefit from it, if they just knew
what it was.</p>
<p>Maybe if enough programmers are exposed to that style of programming
then we’ll begin to see new tools that embrace it.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman">Superhuman</h3>

<p>Superhuman is an invite-only $30/month email client.<sup id="fnref:pricing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pricing">1</a></sup> People like it for its sleek design, responsive speed, and suite of keyboard shortcuts to improve a user’s email efficiency. People justify this purchase over free alternatives by the fact that they spend hours on email everyday. Part of Superhuman’s feature offering includes read statuses, which is useful for executives and sales people who like to keep a pulse on their conversations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.growthalytics.com/images/2021-01-02-the-sublime-text-editor-of-x/superhuman.png" alt="Superhuman Product Screenshot"></p>

<p>Users love Superhuman. Take a quick peak on Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitter">2</a></sup> at the effusive praise the company gets. Andreessen Horowitz led the latest investment round in the company with a valuation of roughly $260 million.</p>

<p>Following in the tailwind of this prosumer email client that has taken Silicon Valley and Twitter by storm are a suite of companies claiming to be “Superhuman for x”.<sup id="fnref:superhumanofx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superhumanofx">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As identified by Todd Goldberg, the “Superhuman of X” has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for speed.</li>
  <li>Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.</li>
  <li>Driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  <li>Beautiful and thoughtfully designed.</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Built as a modern alternative to a product that has legacy distribution effects</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Positioned as a premium product vs. free alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I present Sublime Text: a piece of software more than a decade older than Superhuman, that shares the above attributes. Sublime can be driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts. It’s as thoughtfully designed as I have been shamefully unwilling to purchase the non-trial version for 80 USD. The similarities lie much deeper than that. Sublime has two close-to-instant-speed search-bars: one for opening a file in your project [goto] and one for executing commands.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is also simultaneously opinionated but also configurable. It is simple enough for a programmer to install, open, and “hit the ground running” on a big project with a combination of GOTO (⌘+P) and project search (⌘+Shift+F).</p>

<h3 id="the-sublime-text-of-x">The “Sublime Text of X”</h3>

<p>Without futhur ado, I present a case study sampling of “Sublime Texts of X”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once worked in highly regulated environments and needed a way to recall dozens of complex passwords that changed frequently. I tried to use a password manager, but could not due to the burdens and insecurity of some common design flaws. I wrote a Deterministic Password Generator <a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG</a> to address this.</p><p>If after reading this you still wish to use a traditional password manager, I suggest that you put your passwords into a plain text file and symmetrically encrypt it with <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> or use <a href="https://www.pwsafe.org/">Password Safe</a>. I have no relation with either.</p><p>Here are three common design flaws in password managers:</p><ol><li>Password storage</li><li>Reliance on remote systems</li><li>Web browser integration</li></ol><h2 id="password-storage">Password storage</h2><p>When passwords are stored, they must be encrypted and then retrieved later when needed. Storage, of any type, is a burden. Users are required to backup stored passwords, synchronize them across devices and implement measures to protect them.</p><p>Users must also devise a master password to unlock the encrypted passwords stored by the password manager. This is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_keying">master key</a>. It is generally accepted that master keyed locks are less secure than non-master keyed locks. If the master password is exposed, then confidence (in all the passwords that it unlocks) is lost.</p><p>And, are we certain that the encryption used to store the passwords is implemented correctly? Has the encryption been externally validated? Some password managers are closed-source and proprietary and cannot be examined.</p><p>Encryption is hard. Even respected, expert developers with many years of experience (who seldom make mistakes) <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html">do make mistakes</a> that render encryption weak or in some cases almost useless.</p><h2 id="reliance-on-remote-systems">Reliance on remote systems</h2><p>Ironically, password managers rely on remote systems largely because they store passwords. The first design flaw causes the second.</p><p>Remote systems are outside the user’s control. They are opaque and cannot be examined and should not be trusted with password management. These systems may not be available when needed. They may not be storing or transmitting passwords correctly.</p><p>Externally, the systems may seem correct (strong HTTPS, reasonable CSP) but behind the scenes, no one really knows what’s going on. How are the passwords being transmitted, generated and stored internally? Who has access to them?</p><p>Several popular cloud-based password managers have reported security breaches: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/onelogin-breach-reignites-concerns-over-password-managers/d/d-id/1329034">1</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/potent-lastpass-exploit-underscores-the-dark-side-of-password-managers/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/">3</a>.</p><h2 id="web-browser-integration">Web browser integration</h2><p>Web browsers today have “everything but the kitchen sink” capabilities built-in and are becoming more and more complex each year. They are turning into whole platforms that have browser plug-ins and extensions for every possible need known to humankind.</p><p>While many of these add-ons are handy and useful, we should not trust them with password management. Browsers are just too complex and have far too much going on.</p><h2 id="dpg">DPG</h2><p>I wrote DPG (The Deterministic Password Generator) around 2010 to address the design flaws described above. Here are its key concepts.</p><ol><li>Never store passwords. Rather, generate them as needed based on user input. The need to backup, synchronize and properly encrypt passwords is removed. There is no master password that immediately unlocks all of the other passwords. There is nothing to become lost, stolen or corrupt.</li><li>Only run locally on end-use devices. No reliance on remote systems or web browsers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG is open-source</a> and has several implementations. The passwords it generates can be verified and validated by external implementations in multiple programming languages.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>DPG removes many of the flaws that I have experienced with traditional password managers over the years. Try it. You may like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/compliance">compliance</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		<p>Writing in a thick notebook can be troublesome when you get close to the end of a page. If you're like most people you will encounter a zone where the palm, fingernails or wrist (which I will refer to collectively as "palm") of your writing hand have nowhere to rest, and you may find yourself trying to "float" your hand over the page. As a result, control of the pen-tip becomes enough of an effort to hamper the free-flow of thoughts from the brain through the nervous system to their final conversion to written word.</p>

<p>At best, you get your point across, but usually not without some effort, frustration, and sloppy penmanship.</p>

<p>I suppose one could simply turn to a fresh page before this becomes an issue. That would probably be ok with cheap notebooks, but if you are reading this, yours is probably not cheap, and you intend to wring out all of its value by using every bit of its space.</p>

<p>Thus, as your palm starts to drift off the bottom edge of the page, it needs somewhere to rest...two possible solutions come to mind...one is free, the other cheap:</p>

<p>1. The Smart Phone Trick (free)</p>
<p>2. The Writing Mat (cheap)</p>


<p><strong>The Smart Phone Trick</strong></p>

<p>Placing your smartphone at the bottom of the book at the right point serves as a rest for your palm. It feels like instant relief, at least compared to the alternative of doing nothing at all. It's as if your hand lost its balance at the edge of the page, and the phone is there to catch it.</p>

<p>A smart phone is also a very good thickness (about 10mm) for this purpose. At some point it will be lower than the page you are writing in, and at other points higher, but the differential will never be very great because you won't always need it.</p>

<p>A thin paperback also works well for this purpose, but it can't be too wide or long because it will use up a lot of desk space and may even dig into your forearm. And you'll have to always remember to have it on hand. So, a smartphone is nearly the perfect size....and it is very handy for many of us most of the time. It may take some trial-and-error to figure out exactly when and where you need to deploy the device, but once you do, you will once again find your thoughts freely flowing to any point on the page.</p>

<p>And, as a pen-and-paper person, you may gain some satisfaction from knowing that technology doesn't always exist just for its own sake.</p>


<p><strong>The Writing Mat</strong></p>

<p>Writing mats (sold on this site) are great for enhancing the pen-to-paper connection, and if while writing you press hard with fine points it will protect the lower pages from impressions.</p>

<p>They are also great as a lower extension of the page you are writing on. For that purpose the thin plastic mats seem to work better than the soft mats because they are stiffer and give more support to the palm. But the soft ones work fine too. As you get to that troublesome point on the page, you just keep moving the mat down as long as you need to, and it provides a gentle slope on which your palm can rest.</p>

<p>The mat should be at least the same size as the paper. It can be larger, but larger doesn't have any real advantage other than being able to work with more notebook sizes. They are also harder to carry around. But even if you have the perfect size mat, you have to remember to have it with you, so you may prefer the smart phone trick anyway.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many folks that don't write in notebooks because of this very issue, but given these simple solutions it doesn't have to be hard at all. There is also a certain feeling of satisfaction, security and abundance when writing in a thick notebook, and anyone can deploy these or similar tactics in order to get the full experience.</p>

The model is deterministic—given a set of parameters the output is always the same. Optionally the model can include randomness by perturbing the amount of vapor mass in every site at each step.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>
<li>client -&gt; client 2.5MiB/s</li>
<li>ping 32 milliseconds</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>

<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer.

This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>

<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:

<p>How can your early stage startup use technical debt to survive and thrive? How does technical debt in young startups look and where does it come from?</p>



<p>It’s hard to avoid technical debt completely but you can manage it and use it to your advantage. Let us have a look how technical debt is created in startups and how you can keep it in check even when your company is in hyper growth.</p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-1024x648.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-300x190.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-768x486.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt-648x410.jpg 648w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/survive-technical-debt.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>The paradox of success</h2>



<p>The most common way for startups to create technical debt is ironically the very thing that makes them succeed: A validated idea. You build things and test them out. Most ideas don’t stick. You move on. Until suddenly you have something that people really want and things spin out of control. That hacked together throwaway prototype is so sticky you can’t afford to lose your momentum. There is no time to rebuild it. You build upon it. That’s your first piece of technical debt – your prototype turned MVP.</p>



<h2>The right kind of technical debt</h2>



<p>The successful prototype sounds much like a eulogy of failed startups but it doesn’t have to be. Up to this point your technical debt is manageable and it’s enabling you to stay in business. You have turned your throwaway prototype into a bridge loan to get to the next milestone. You can use it to close the next funding round or spend money on customer acquisition to grab a foothold in the market.</p>



<h2>Paying the interest on your technical debt</h2>



<p>If you keep funding your success with debt it will catch up to you once one of two things happen. Either your growth will slow down or your technical debt has accumulated and development slows down. Both lead to you struggling to pay the interest on your debt. So it’s vital so reduce your technical debt <em>before</em> it spirals out of control. Here is a strategy to do exactly that.</p>



<h2>Balancing the short term with the long term</h2>



<p>When you build out your product you will come across technical debt. At this point don’t work around it but work through the technical debt. You need to <a href="https://killalldefects.com/2019/12/24/technical-debt-as-risks/">understand the risk your technical debt carries</a> and not get lost in the short term opportunities ahead. As a lead engineer or CTO it’s your responsibility to advocate maintenance work as a <em>Must have</em>, not a <em>nice to have</em>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately this ties the faith of your startup’s technical debt to one single person – you. To mitigate this we can try to bake it into the organisation’s behaviour by designing a process which balances the short term and long term thinking.</p>



<h2>Manage technical debt through your product</h2>



<p>When you build something new you should commit to do two things with it: Either you remove the feature if it does not bring in the expected results or you iterate on it. Axe any code before it turns into a liability or grant yourself the time to fix it and redo it properly. This strategy is effective because when you build a new feature you know the least about it, so even if you tried you probably couldn’t build it completely <em>right</em>. But once you’ve released it you have learned a lot more which will help greatly paying back that technical debt.</p>



<p>With this commitment the burden of fixing technical debt is not solely on you anymore. The product side is now your party in crime. However, in an early startup that probably just means two people instead of one. Once your organisation grows you need to ensure this attitude survives.</p>



<h2>Culture can beat technical debt</h2>



<p>When your company grows you want to fight technical debt before it gets out of control. Unfortunately the rapidly changing structures in a fast growing startup are a great breeding ground for technical debt.</p>



<p>You can try to establish specific roles like architects and lead engineers and processes like code reviews to fight your technical debt. But an engineer can’t manage technical debt unless the organisation enables them to. You need to create a culture which balances the short term with the long term thinking. A culture where engineers can take pride in their craft and not have to be the bad guys who say No all the time. Here are some hints how such a culture could look like.</p>



<h3>Do less but do it well</h3>



<p>Instead of getting <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">trapped in a fear driven culture</a> focus on your strengths. What makes your startup stand out from the competitors? Hone that skill. This is important to cut out distractions. It also keeps the technical debt at bay because you’re not racing from one feature to the next.</p>



<h3>Celebrate your engineering</h3>



<p>What your startup celebrates and rewards is what it creates more of. So if you only celebrate sale numbers and growth rates but none of your engineering accomplishments you end up with stunted engineering. So celebrate the engineering solutions and put the engineers in the spotlight. They are behind the scenes of product too often.</p>



<h3>Hire the best and train them</h3>



<p>Your technical debt is rarely caused by just bad engineering. But it can be part of the problem. Great engineers can avoid many forms of careless technical debt. You should leverage their skills to keep the growth of your technical debt in check. We all want to hire the best engineers. That’s easier said than done. But you can work with what you already have. Invest in training your engineers the best you can. This not only avoids technical debt but greatly improves the satisfaction of your engineers and their retention.</p>







<p>What makes startups successful is often the root of their technical debt. If your startup struggles with technical debt it’s important to note that this is neither a death&nbsp;sentence nor something to be ignored. Use it wisely and give your organisation room to tackle it so your startup can continue to thrive.</p>

<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> When you are bored in face-to-face conversations or don’t want to interact with others, do you slowly start using your phone and divert your attention away from the person? Snubbing another person in favor of your phone is called <em>phubbing</em> (phone + snubbing) and it is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300704" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">common complaint in relationships</a>. <em>Phubbing your partner is called Pphubbing or Partner phubbing and research acknowledges that it worsens relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, and could also add to depression.</em> Phubbing could be a form of social exclusion and researchers argue that <a href="https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/12590/11560" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">even watching others phub</a> can induce stress and lower regard for the phubbers.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_phone_addiction">What is phone addiction?</span></h2>



<p>Let’s first understand what is phone addiction and what counts as excessive phone use.  Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way. </p>



<p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00175/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">become an addiction</a> in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p>



<p>Not all phone use is a sign of addiction, even if the volume of use is high. A <em>loss of control</em> in how the phone is used and <em>psychological dependency</em> is an indicator of addiction. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article-abstract/42/3/441/4064735?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Recreational phone use</a> and productive phone use isn’t the problem, it’s the inability to regulate usage and unhealthy coping for larger problems that usually makes screen-time problematic. If you are addicted to your phone, you probably can’t let go of phone-related activities no matter how often you tell yourself you need to let go.</p>




<p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and low self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction. Social media addiction usually comes down to these “internet reward points.”</p>

<h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3>



<p><strong>There is no cut-off point to show you are addicted to your phone which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p>



<ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li><li>You feel bad about yourself and you go online to feel good but you end up feeling worse looking at what others are doing.<em> Such compulsive phone use is likely to emerge from other mental health issues.</em></li></ol>



<h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3>



<ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol>



<h2><span id="Statistics_on_phone_and_internet_use">Statistics on phone and internet use</span></h2>



<ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

<h2><span id="Important_research_highlights_on_phone_addiction">Important research highlights on phone addiction</span></h2>



<p>Phone addiction goes <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08934215.2020.1780456" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">hand in hand</a> with anxiety and that anxiety often lowers the motivation to engage with people in real life. This is a huge problem because re-connecting with people in the offline world is a solution that improves the quality of life. The unnecessary drop in motivation because of addiction makes it that much harder to maintain social health.</p>



<p>Phone addiction can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460319311839" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cause poor cognitive performance</a> in day-to-day life. That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p>




<p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction. And improving mental health can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4354213/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">counter addiction</a>. Proneness to boredom <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439317741087" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">can increase</a> the likelihood of problematic phone use but not the frequency of phone use. This ultimately makes boredom a pathway between problematic phone use and anxiety or depression.</p>







<h2><span id="9_Ways_to_overcome_phone_addiction_and_reduce_screen_time">9 Ways to overcome phone addiction and reduce screen time</span></h2>



<h3><span id="1_Schedule_a_time_for_un-monitored_phone_use">1.&nbsp;<strong>Schedule a time for un-monitored phone use</strong></span></h3>



<p>Grant yourself as much time as you want within a fixed daily limit at a specific hour of the day. As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p>




<h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>His two children could lose their father for the rest of their lives</strong></p>



<p>Although important legal principles are at stake in the extradition trial of Julian Assange, for which a ruling will be handed down on January 4, it should not be forgotten that there are important human issues at stake as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such issue is Assange’s health, which has progressively worsened under what seems to be cruel and even sadistic maltreatment by the British government, including the refusal of appropriate medical care and confining him in his cell for 23 hours a day, seven days a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other is that, if the Judge’s ruling is adverse, Julian’s two children may never see their father again.</p>



<p>Many stories have been written about the legal issues in Julian’s case, and the chilling effect that his extradition to the U.S.—where he will almost certainly be imprisoned for life—would have on journalists around the world who seek to expose the lies and crimes committed by their own governments.</p>



<p>Most of those stories present Julian, primarily, as a symbol, a hero to his principles, and an ominous example in how far tyrannical governments and corrupt politicians will go to keep their citizens ignorant and submissive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Julian is more than a symbol. He is also a father, a husband-to-be (even if he may have to be married in prison) and, most importantly, a human being—one who, as the world watches in horror and shame, is being subjected to calculated assaults on his physical and mental health in hopes that he will quickly die and spare the British and American governments the embarrassment of having to deal with him.</p>



<p>For nearly three years Assange and his partner, Stella Moris, had successfully kept their personal relationship and the existence of their two children a secret. Moris only revealed it (on April 11)&nbsp;because&nbsp;“Julian’s poor physical health puts him at serious risk, like many other&nbsp;vulnerable people, and I don’t believe he will survive infection with coronavirus”—which had been spreading rapidly through the British prison system, especially at Belmarsh, the high security prison in which Assange is being held.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a prison, Belmarsh has a very bad reputation, and is ordinarily reserved for the most violent and dangerous prisoners, which Assange was certainly not. Once known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/julian-assange-being-held-in-uk-belmarsh-prison-known-as-britains-guantanamo-bay-2019-4">“Britain’s Guantanamo Bay,”</a> a number of its inmates participated in high profile terrorist attacks, and at least one ISIS executioner, nicknamed “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/terror-attacks-uk-prison-belmarsh-streatham-radicalisation-a9332531.html">Jihadi John”</a> resides there.</p>



<p>For much of his stay at Belmarsh, Assange has been forced to remain in his cell for 23 hours a day and has even been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/06/julian-assange-trial-extradition/">deprived of a radio</a>. Three prisoners have died at Belmarsh this year under unexplained circumstances, and another was discovered dead in his cell just last month.&nbsp;With Coronavirus spreading throughout the facility, the danger to Assange increases every day.</p>

<p>Noting Assange’s growing fragility, Moris said that, “I have discovered that love makes the most intolerable circumstances seem bearable but this is different, I am now terrified I will not see him alive again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stella Moris, 37, is a South African-born attorney who met&nbsp;Assange in 2011, after she had been engaged by his legal team to help fight his extradition.</p>



<p>“Over time,” she said, “Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his.” Their actual relationship began in 2015, under what she described as “extraordinary circumstances.” They became engaged in 2017.</p>

<p>Moris had been raising their two children on her own, as a single mother, and did her best to shield them from the harmful publicity she knew would surround them if their existence became known. But she changed her mind and finally went public, she said, because their lives were now “on the brink,” with Assange facing death every day as a result of his rapidly deteriorating health, which made him all the more vulnerable to the wave of Covid-19 spreading through Belmarsh.</p>



<p>“Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life,” she said. “I have lived quietly and privately, raising Gabriel and Max on my own and longing for the day we could be together as a family. Now I have to speak out because I can see that his life is on the brink.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8210957/WikiLeaks-boss-Julian-Assange-fathered-two-children-inside-Ecuadorian-embassy-lawyer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video interview with the Daily Mail</a>, Moris revealed that, via a secret video hookup, Assange was able to observe the births of both of his children in real time, at the hospital in London. He later was also able to meet Gabriel in person after Moris smuggled him into the embassy, without revealing that Assange was the father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She further revealed that both boys had visited their father in prison, and that the couple planned to marry, even if Assange had to spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>



<p>Moris says they were told by someone on the Ecuadorean embassy staff that the CIA (which had illegally planted spy cameras all over Assange’s quarters, including his bathroom) had tried to steal some of Gabriel’s DNA from his diaper because they suspected that Assange might be the father and wanted confirmation.</p>



<p>There were also reports that the U.S.&nbsp;plotted to kill Julian Assange and make it look like an accident, and that spies discussed kidnapping or poisoning him in the Ecuadorean embassy. That story appeared in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8041597/US-plotted-kill-Julian-Assange-make-look-like-accident.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 25 Daily Mail</a>, but was surprisingly (or not so surprisingly) not followed up by corporate media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although not often covered, the human side of Julian Assange, even when reported, has too often been presented by the media in lurid tabloid fashion, not for sympathy but for sensation.</p>



<p>There has, in fact, been precious little sympathy for Assange in the media, and as a result his case has not been widely—or fairly—covered. The BBC, especially, has virtually buried all mention of the trial, even though it is taking place in their own backyard, and will have a huge impact on the way their reporters will be able to cover the news in the future.</p>



<p>What we and the rest of the world—especially members of the working press—will now have to do is simply bite our nails until Judge Vanessa Baraitser (a notoriously “hanging judge” with a 96% record of approving extraditions) hands down her ruling on January 4.</p>

So for the foreseeable future my workstation will be pulling double-duty for macOS-based software development with a MacBook Pro and Windows-based gaming on a PC.</p> <p>Modern monitors come with a lot of interesting features. Did you know you can connect a MacBook to a monitor using a single USB-C cable and transmit USB, power, audio <strong><em>and</em></strong> video?</p> <p>Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as knowing whether a monitor supports USB-C. Many monitors support USB-C but don’t have any sort of way to pipe the audio out from the monitor (for example, to a sound bar). And some monitors have USB-C and audio out, but only provide 15W of power.</p> <p>With enough features, the monitor effectively acts as a KVM+audio, like so:</p> <p><img src="https://jamejone.github.io/public/usb-c-monitor-diagram.png" alt="USB-C monitor diagram"></p> <p>So I set out to identify a monitor that meets all of my criteria. Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>Has a built-in KVM switch that lets me easily switch between my PC and MacBook.</li> <li>Provides at least 60W power over USB-C (the bare minimum to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro).</li> <li>Some sort of audio output (almost always analog).</li> <li>Upstream USB-B Port so that I can plug my keyboard and mouse into the monitor and pipe PC audio through the monitor to the sound bar.</li> <li>VESA mountable.</li> <li>IPS panel. The viewing angles on my TN panel are so bad it interferes with my work so IPS is a must.</li> <li>27” or 34” ultrawide @ 1440p. Good for gaming and happens to be <a href="https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays/">the ideal non-retina DPI for macOS</a>. Full retina @ 5k instead of 1440p would be nice, but unfortunately I couldn’t find such a monitor that meets all the minimum criteria. Awkward DPIs are a deal-breaker due to scaling and “shimmering” effects mentioned in the linked post.</li> </ul> <p>Nice-to-haves:</p> <ul> <li>Adaptive sync (AS).</li> <li>144hz refresh rate. At 60hz I lose track of my mouse cursor in League of Legends and we can’t have that!</li> <li>90W power delivery over USB-C.</li> <li>Reasonable price.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I found after about 15 hours of research:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Size</th> <th>Pros</th> <th>Cons</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>ViewSonic VP2771</td> <td>27” 1440p</td> <td>$200-$450</td> <td>60hz, 60W USB-C</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LG 34WK95C-W</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>Adaptive Sync</td> <td>75hz, 60W USB-C, ~$1,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dell U3421WE</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>90W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LG 34WK95U</td> <td>34” 4k UW</td> <td>85W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,300, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dell U3219Q</td> <td>32” 4k</td> <td>90W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$800, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BenQ PD3220U</td> <td>32” 4k</td> <td>85W USB-C</td> <td>60hz, ~$1,200, awkward DPI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Razer Raptor 27</td> <td>27” 1440p</td> <td>AS, 144hz, HDR</td> <td>15W USB-C, No VESA mount, $700</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Philips 346B1C</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td>90W, AS, $450</td> <td>100hz, VA panel</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Acer Predator X34 S</td> <td>34” 1440p UW</td> <td><strong>200hz</strong>, AS, 85W</td> <td>Not available (yet)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I can’t guarantee this is an exhaustive list, but it might be. I left off monitors that are no longer for sale or lack crucial features like an audio output or upstream USB-B port.</p> <p>As you can see, there’s no ideal monitor except for the Acer Predator X34 S, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-predator-x34-s-a-34-inch-200hz-nano-ips-curved-monitor-w-05ms-response-time">isn’t available in the US yet and currently costs ¥9999</a> (roughly $1,500). In terms of what’s available today, you ultimately need to choose whether you want to sacrifice refresh rate, VESA mounting, USB-C charging, or panel type.</p> <p>As luck would have it, I ended up snagging a ViewSonic VP2771 on eBay for $200 shipped. After all, I still have a 144hz TN panel that I can keep plugged into the gaming PC. It’s not ideal but it’ll work until I get my hands on that Acer.</p> <p>Let me know in the comments if you find a monitor that should be in this list. If you want to play League of Legends together you can find me under the summoner name JamesJonesJrJr.</p> <p>Stay safe out there, friends.</p> <h3>Thanks for reading.

      <div>
        <p>This article describes the approach I’m following to set personal goals for myself, in the form of Objectives and Key-results (OKR).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are new to OKR, scroll down to the <strong>Resources</strong> section for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://hackpravj.com/images/pageimage-setting-up-personal-okr-jfm-2021.png" alt="Personal OKR for JFM 2021" title="Personal OKR for JFM 2021"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A publically available worksheet for my personal OKRs for January-February-March 2021 is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hN5ldi0SgoGFyvXwyLCmf98337AyIt1xzbynVicGH-8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve worked them out in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a better grip on the concept by implementing them in a relatively newer setting/environment outside of the work</li>
<li>Effectively set goals in the personal life where it’s easy to measure progress and find out weeker/strong areas to work on</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue updating this article and the attached document in case of any changes or updates. If you want to discuss more, or in case of any feedback, please reach out to me at <a href="https://twitter.com/hackpravj">@hackpravj</a></p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>Start with the themes representing the different areas of life. For example, in your case, it can be Personal-finance, Health, Creativity, and more. You can have your own personal reasons behind selecting the final themes.</p>
<p>Here are the 7 separate themes in my current plan.</p>
<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Habits</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="backlog">Backlog</h3>
<p>For each of the themes, I came up with a backlog of aspirations and ideas.</p>
<p>This has helped me connect the ideas with each other if there is any such possibility, OR ruling out ideas that are duplicate to each other.</p>
<p>Some of the themes or ideas that didn’t make it to the current plan, will be considered during the next quarter’s OKRs.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>To come up with the objectives associated with the themes, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you want to reach? (in relation to this theme or some specific area related to the theme)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a rule-of-thumb, objectives are ambitious and qualitatively represent an end state. It’s more of an outcome, rather than an output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if you’ve selected “Health” as one of the themes, the following can be an objective for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective-1: Get in a better shape</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-results">Key-results</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided your objective, the key-results will be a mechanism to show your progress towards that objective.</p>
<p>To come up with the key-results associated with the objective, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>How will I know I am getting there (<em>reaching the objective</em>)?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Key-results are milestones that will move you closer to the objective if achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the earlier example of the Objective (<em>Get in a better shape</em>), here are two representative key-results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-result-1: Reduce weight by 10 kilograms (<em>or pounds</em>)</li>
<li>Key-result-2: Achieve a daily step count of 10K steps walked</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="initiatives">Initiatives</h3>
<p>Once you know the key-results, ask yourself the following question to come up with the initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we doing to get there (to the milestone set by the key-result)?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the common mistake during OKR planning is; ignoring the difference between the initiatives/key-results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, consider the first key-result (<em>Reduce weight by 10 kilograms</em>), there can be different initiatives (that you can do to reach the milestone set by the key-result).</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiative-1: Limit total meals per day to 2</li>
<li>Initiative-2: Stop eating after 7 PM</li>
<li>Initiative-3: Start intermittent-fasting every other day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="okr-check-in">OKR check-in</h3>
<p>As you’re moving ahead with your OKR planning, you need to ensure that you’re regularly measuring your progress.</p>
<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can provide different weights to the key-results associated with an objective.
<ul>
<li>For example, the first key-result (<em>Reduce weight by 10 kilograms</em>) can take up 70% (<em>relatively higher</em>) weightage than the second key-result (<em>Walking 10K steps daily</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The progress for a key-result can be measured based on the % completion of the same.
<ul>
<li>A typically considered “sweet-spot” for OKRs is 60-70%.</li>
<li>If a key-result’s progress is higher than 70%, it might be a sign of lower ambitious objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>OKRs can also be implemented in personal life, out of the business/work (refer to Manas’s work on personal OKR [<a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html">start</a>] [<a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/31/okrs-2020-update.html">final update</a>]).</li>
<li>They serve as a goal-setting tool that helps you assess your progress on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bb49bdb516c4ad0f99fa5fc3909b4f5caf8d5253/1dd14/images/uploads/ad-test-results-2.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

			<p>I don’t usually do Happy New Year posts, but given how “well” 2020 went I thought it was appropriate to start 2021 with a whimsy post.&nbsp; This post is probably going to date me since it’s been a few years – OK, decades – since these were current.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not the actual computer, but the same model. I was first exposed to computers during the personal computer heyday of the early 1980s. Back then, my school had two computers, one <a href="http://www.trs-80.org/model-3/">TRS 80 Model 3</a> and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">Sinclair ZX81</a>. The ZX81 was used to teach pupils rudimentary programming. I wouldn’t be surprised if one of the teachers actually built it from a kit as that was the cheapest way to get into one.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I grew up in Europe where computers like the Apple ][ were very expensive and didn’t gain much traction in the educational field. Or with hobbists, either. Yes, there were some around but you saw a lot more VIC20s, C64s or Ataris. A lot of schools including mine bought European manufactured computers like Sinclairs and later, Amstrad/Schneider CPC 464s.</p>

<p>Either way I probably watched too many retro computing videos on YouTube and ended up finding a Timex 1000 on eBay. For those not well versed in personal computer history, Timex sold variants of Sinclair computers in the US. Here it is, in all its glory:</p>

<figure id="attachment_1759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1759"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81/" rel="attachment wp-att-1759"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81.jpg" alt="My Timex 1000/Sinclair ZX81" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81.jpg 1024w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-380x253.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1759">My Timex 1000 (nee Sinclair ZX81) in all it’s glory</figcaption></figure>
<p>I actually bought this computer a couple of year ago. Between a house move, work and a bunch of other projects it mostly sat in its box. It is very clean and doesn’t appear to have seen a lot of use, so I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to get it working with minimal effort. If not, well, it’s a cheap way to polish my soldering skills.</p>
<p>As the ZX81 only came with 1KB of RAM – which included the video RAM – there isn’t that much that you can do with one out of the box. Fortunately this one came with the humongous 16KB RAM expansion that connects on the back.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1758"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81-16k/" rel="attachment wp-att-1758"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k.jpg" alt="ZX81 with 16KB RAM expansion" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k.jpg 1024w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-16k-380x253.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1758">ZX81 with 16KB RAM expansion</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those expansions were notorious for causing involuntary resets if you looked at the computer funny. They actually connect straight the motherboard and are only held on by the connector itself, so any movement is, well, not great.</p>
<p>Also, I guess the warranty has run out:</p>
<figure id="attachment_1757" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1757"><a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2021/01/01/i-bought-the-first-computer-i-ever-wrote-a-program-on/zx81-warranty/" rel="attachment wp-att-1757"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty.jpg" alt="Timex 1000 warranty slip" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty.jpg 683w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/zx81-warranty-173x260.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1757">The warranty.

<p>Anyway, Happy 2021. Normal service with be resumed soon.</p>

		<p><a href="http://multicians.org/"><b>Multics</b></a>, the <i>Multiplexed Information and Computing Service</i>, is the quintessential interactive time-sharing mainframe operating system. </p><!--running on 36-bit General Electric GE-645, Honeywell 6180, Honeywell Series 60 Level 68 <small>(Level 68/DPS, DPS-68)</small> and Honeywell-Bull DPS-8/M hardware.-->

<p> Multics began in 1965 as a pioneering research project, a joint effort of the best and brightest minds in academia, government, and industry. 
</p><p><b>Without exaggeration, one could say Multics was the <i><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/"><b>Project Apollo</b></a></i> of operating system development.</b></p><p>

Virtually every operating system from 1965 forward was heavily influenced by Multics. Nearly every feature associated with modern computing — the hierarchical file system, interprocess communication, single-level storage, dynamic linking, high-availability, online reconfiguration, ACL-based access control, multilevel isolation, and even the relational database — is a Multics innovation. 
</p><!--Despite networking not being "baked-in" to the original design, the modular structure of the system allowed rapid development and deployment of communication and network technologies including serial links, modem dialin/dialout, HASP/RJE, BSC, TCP/IP, NCP, X.25, CHAOS, and DSA.
<br><br>-->

<p><b>MIT Multics was the sixth system to join the Internet &nbsp;</b>(<i><small>ARPAnet</small></i>)<b>&nbsp; in September of 1971.</b></p><p>

Unlike most research projects, the Multics system graduated from academia, becoming an acclaimed commercial product of Honeywell <small>(later Bull)</small>, and finding success in education, government, and industry. Multics sites included MIT, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Pentagon, NSA, the Canadian Department of National Defense, Bell Canada, Ford, General Motors, the University of Calgary, and Oakland University.
</p><!--Many Multics sites were on the cutting edge of computing, pushing the limits of technology, expanding their installations with additional novel hardware. Multics was at the heart of early massively-parallel processing and vector supercomputing installations, integrating and interfacing with systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARAN">Goodyear STARAN</a>, the first commercial massively parallel system, and the famous <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/supercomputers/10/7">Cray-1</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_X-MP">Cray X-MP</a> machines.<br><br>-->

<!--<code><b>BAN.AI Public Access Multics</b></code> hopes to fulfill the role envisioned by the <a href="http://multics50.org">Multics50 initiative</a> of "a practical, living exhibit of one of the most influential contributions to computer science".<br><br>-->

<!--As noted by the <a href="http://multics50.org/">Multics50 initiative</a>,--><p> Although the Multics system software and the hardware on which it ran spanned multiple commercial generations and was used in critical production until the year 2000, the overall body of knowledge for Multics  primarily consists of the <a href="https://ban.ai/multics/doc">papers, reports, and books</a> written about the academic iterations of the system, as it existed from 1965&nbsp;-&nbsp;1972.</p><p><span size="+1">By providing the <b>BAN.AI Public Access Multics</b> service, we hope to challenge misconceptions and myths by providing access to an actively developed, maintained, and functional example of a Multics production system, operating in the intended role of a computing utility — not a mere historic artifact.</span></p><p>

<p>Clearly, this stuff must be really hard to get right.  I also must be a moron, since,
after having written some thousand lines of Python, I don’t even know what problem we are
trying to solve here, and the abundance of relevant programs with subtly different names
has deterred me from reading up on it so far.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-virtual-environment">So what <em>is</em> a virtual environment?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" title="The Python Tutorial: Virtual Environments and Packages">official docs’ tutorial</a> describes a virtual environment as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular
  version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it’s a directory with a Python interpreter?  Easy enough.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mkdir virtual_env
<span>$ </span>cp /bin/python3 virtual_env/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s see.  Directory?  Check.  Contains a Python installation?  Check.  Contains a number
of additional packages?  Zero is a number!  (Check.)  Particular version?  Um…</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>virtual_env/
<span>$ </span>./python3 --version
Python 3.6.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I think that will do.  Is it self-contained, though?  It doesn’t contain itself…</p>

<p><span>
<img src="https://meribold.org/assets/russell.png" alt="Another nerd: Bertrand Russell in 1916" title="Consider the directory containing all directories that don't contain themselves.">
</span></p>

<p>Jokes aside, there are only two things missing to actually make our directory a virtual
environment as specified by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/" title="PEP 405 -- Python Virtual Environments"><abbr title="Python Enhancement Proposal">PEP</abbr> 405</a>, the proposal that integrated a standard mechanism
for virtual environments with Python.<sup id="fnref:before-405"><a href="#fn:before-405">1</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>A file named <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> containing the line <code>home = /usr/bin</code></li>
  <li>A <code>lib/python3.6/site-packages</code> subdirectory</li>
</ol>

<p>(Both paths are subject to the <abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr> and the second one also to the Python version used.)</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>'home = /usr/bin'</span> &gt; pyvenv.cfg
<span>$ </span>mkdir -p lib/python3.6/site-packages
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I will also move the Python binary into a <code>bin</code> subdirectory.<sup id="fnref:why-tho"><a href="#fn:why-tho">2</a></sup></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mkdir bin <span>&amp;&amp;</span> mv python3 bin/
</code></pre>
</div>

<!-- >   [T]he internal virtual environment layout mimics the layout of the Python installation
>   itself on each platform.  
>   ---<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/#creating-virtual-environments> -->

<p>Fair.  We have a directory that formally qualifies as a virtual environment:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>tree --noreport
.
├── bin
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── python3
├── lib
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── python3.6
│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── site-packages
└── pyvenv.cfg
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This leads us to the next question.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point">What’s the point?</h2>

<p>When we run our copy of the Python binary, the <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file changes what happens
during startup: the presence of the <code>home</code> key tells Python the binary belongs to a
virtual environment, the key’s value (<code>/usr/bin</code>) tells it where to find a complete Python
installation that includes the standard library.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that <code>./lib/python3.6/site-packages</code> becomes part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html">module search
path</a>.  The point is that we can now install packages to that location, in particular,
specific versions that may conflict with the dependencies of another Python program on the
same system.<sup id="fnref:python-level-isolation"><a href="#fn:python-level-isolation">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, if your project needs exactly version 0.0.3 of
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/left-pad">left-pad</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pip3 install -t lib/python3.6/site-packages/ left-pad<span>==</span>0.0.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now this will work:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./bin/python3 -c <span>'import left_pad'</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While this should raise <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError"><code>ModuleNotFoundError</code></a>, as desired:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python3 -c <span>'import left_pad'</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Another project on the same system could have a different version of left-pad in its own
virtual environment, without interfering with this one.</p>

<!--
TODO: talk about isolation from the system-level and user-level site-packages directories?
-->



<p>In practice, one does not simply create virtual environments by hand, which brings us back
to the dauntingly long list of tools above.  Fortunately, one of them is not like the
others.  While it’s predated by most of them, this one ships with Python as part of the
standard library: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" title="The Python Standard Library: venv — Creation of virtual environments"><em>venv</em></a>.<sup id="fnref:venv-and-pyvenv"><a href="#fn:venv-and-pyvenv">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In its simplest form, venv is used to create a virtual environment like so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>python3 -m venv virtual_env
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This creates the <code>virtual_env</code> directory and also copies or symlinks the Python
interpreter:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>virtual_env
<span>$ </span>find -name python3
./bin/python3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It also copies a bunch of other stuff: I get 650 files in 89 subdirectories amounting to
about 10 MiB in total.  One of those files is the <code>pip</code> binary, and we can use it to
install packages into the virtual environment without passing extra command-line
arguments:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./bin/pip install left-pad
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can read more about using venv and <em>optional</em> magic like “activate” scripts in the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python tutorial</a> or venv’s
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">documentation</a>—this post is only meant to
boil down what a virtual environment actually is.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A virtual environment is a directory containing a Python interpreter, a special
<code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file that affects startup of the interpreter, and some third-party Python
packages.  Python packages installed into a virtual environment will not interfere with
other Python applications on the same system.  The “<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/">standard tool for creating virtual
environments</a>” is venv.</p>

		<p>As you may know, I am Qt 5 maintainer in Debian. Maintaning Qt means not only
bumping the version each time a new version is released, but also making sure
Qt builds successfully on all architectures that are supported in Debian (and
for some submodules, the automatic tests pass).</p>
<p>An important sort of build failures are endianness specific failures. Most
widely used architectures (x86_64, aarch64) are little endian. However, Debian
officially supports one big endian architecture (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z">s390x</a>), and unofficially
a few more ports are provided, such as <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/PPC64">ppc64</a> and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Sparc64">sparc64</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qt upstream does not have any big endian machine in their CI
system, so endianness issues get noticed only when the packages fail to build
on our build daemons. In the last years I have discovered and fixed some such
issues in various parts of Qt, so I decided to write a post to illustrate how
to write really cross-platform C/C++ code.</p>
<h2>Issue 1: the WebP image format handler (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtimageformats/+/86275">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The relevant code snippet is:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>()</span> <span>!=</span> <span>QImage</span><span>::</span><span>Format_ARGB32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>srcImage</span> <span>=</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>convertToFormat</span><span>(</span><span>QImage</span><span>::</span><span>Format_ARGB32</span><span>);</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>WebPPictureImportBGRA</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>picture</span><span>,</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>bits</span><span>(),</span> <span>srcImage</span><span>.</span><span>bytesPerLine</span><span>()))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code here is serializing the images into <code>QImage::Format_ARGB32</code> format, and
then passing the bytes into WebP’s import function. With this format, the image
is stored using a 32-bit ARGB format (0xAARRGGBB). This means that the bytes
will be 0xBB, 0xGG, 0xRR, 0xAA or little endian and 0xAA, 0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB on
big endian. However, <code>WebPPictureImportBGRA</code> expects the first format on all
architectures.</p>
<p>The fix was to use <code>QImage::Format_RGBA8888</code>. As the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimage.html#Format-enum">QImage documentation</a>
says, with this format <em>the order of the colors is the same on any architecture
if read as bytes 0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB, 0xAA</em>.</p>
<h2>Issue 2: <code>qimage_converter_map</code> structure (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/101769">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code seems to already support big endian. But maybe you can spot the error?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#if Q_BYTE_ORDER == Q_LITTLE_ENDIAN</span>
        <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>convert_ARGB_to_ARGB_PM</span><span>,</span>
<span>#else</span>
        <span>0</span><span>,</span>
        <span>0</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It is the missing comma! It is present in the little endian block, but not in
the big endian one. This was fixed trivially.</p>
<h2>Issue 3: QHandle, part of Qt 3D module (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qt3d/+/162737">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>QHandle class uses a union that is declared as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>struct</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_index</span> <span>:</span> <span>IndexBits</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_counter</span> <span>:</span> <span>CounterBits</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_unused</span> <span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Data</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>m_handle</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The sizes are declared such as IndexBits + CounterBits + 2 is always
equal to 32 (four bytes).</p>
<p>Then we have a constructor that sets the values of Data struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>QHandle</span><span>(</span><span>quint32</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>quint32</span> <span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>
    <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>m_unused</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The value of <code>m_handle</code> will be different depending on endianness!
So the test that was expecting a particular value with given constructor
arguments was failing. I fixed it by using the following macro:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#if Q_BYTE_ORDER == Q_BIG_ENDIAN</span>
<span>#define GET_EXPECTED_HANDLE(qHandle) ((qHandle.index() &lt;&lt; (qHandle.CounterBits + 2)) + (qHandle.counter() &lt;&lt; 2))</span>
<span>#else </span><span>/* Q_LITTLE_ENDIAN */</span><span></span>
<span>#define GET_EXPECTED_HANDLE(qHandle) (qHandle.index() + (qHandle.counter() &lt;&lt; qHandle.IndexBits))</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Issue 4: QML compiler (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdeclarative/+/197746">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The QML compiler used a helper class named LEUInt32 (based on <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qleinteger.html">QLEInteger</a>)
that always stored the numbers in little endian internally. This class
can be safely mixed with native quint32 on little endian systems, but not
on big endian.</p>
<p>Usually the compiler would warn about type mismatch, but here the code used
<code>reinterpret_cast</code>, such as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>quint32</span> <span>*</span><span>objectTable</span> <span>=</span> <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>quint32</span><span>*&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>+</span> <span>qmlUnit</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>offsetToObjects</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So this was not noticed on build time, but the compiler was crashing. The fix
was trivial again, replacing quint32 with QLEUInt32.</p>
<h2>Issue 5: QModbusPdu, part of Qt Serial Bus module (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtserialbus/+/245206">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code snippet is simple:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>Invalid</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>.</span><span>readRawData</span><span>((</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>code</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>stream</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>QModbusPdu::FunctionCode</code> is an enum, so <code>code</code> is a multi-byte value (even if
only one byte is significant). However, <code>(char *) (&amp;code)</code> returns a pointer to
the first byte of it. It is the needed byte on little endian systems, but it is
the wrong byte on big endian ones!</p>
<p>The correct fix was using a temporary one-byte variable:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>quint8</span> <span>codeByte</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>.</span><span>readRawData</span><span>((</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>codeByte</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>quint8</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>stream</span><span>;</span>
<span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span> <span>code</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>QModbusPdu</span><span>::</span><span>FunctionCode</span><span>)</span> <span>codeByte</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Issue 6: <code>qt_is_ascii</code> (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/258164">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>This function, as the name says, checks whether a string is ASCII. It does
that by splitting the string into 4-byte chunks:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ptr</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>quint32</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>qFromUnaligned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>quint32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>0x80808080U</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint</span> <span>idx</span> <span>=</span> <span>qCountTrailingZeroBits</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
        <span>ptr</span> <span>+=</span> <span>idx</span> <span>/</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>ptr</span> <span>+=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>idx / 8</code> is the number of trailing zero bytes. However, the bytes which are
trailing on little endian are actually leading on big endian! So we can use
<code>qCountLeadingZeroBits</code> there.</p>
<h2>Issue 7: the bundled copy of tinycbor (<a href="https://github.com/thiagomacieira/tinycbor/pull/1">upstream pull request</a>)</h2>
<p>Similar to issue 5, the code was reading into the wrong byte:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytesNeeded</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>read_bytes_unchecked</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>bytesNeeded</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytesNeeded</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
        <span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span> <span>=</span> <span>cbor_ntohs</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>extra</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>extra</code> has type uint16_t, so it has two bytes. When we need only one byte,
we read into the wrong byte, so the resulting number is 256 times higher on
big endian than it should be. Adding a temporary one-byte variable fixed it.</p>
<h2>Issue 8: perfparser, part of Qt Creator (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt-creator/perfparser/+/305990">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>Here it is not trivial to find the issue just looking at the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>qint32</span> <span>dataStreamVersion</span> <span>=</span> <span>qToLittleEndian</span><span>(</span><span>QDataStream</span><span>::</span><span>Qt_DefaultCompiledVersion</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However the linker was producing an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>undefined reference to `QDataStream::Version qbswap<qdatastream::version>(QDataStream::Version)'</qdatastream::version></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On little endian systems, <code>qToLittleEndian</code> is a no-op, but on big endian
systems, it is a template function defined for some known types. But it turns
out we need to explicitly convert enum values to a simple type, so the fix
was passing <code>qint32(QDataStream::Qt_DefaultCompiledVersion)</code> to that function.</p>
<h2>Issue 9: Qt Personal Information Management (<a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtpim/+/319865">code review</a>)</h2>
<p>The code in test was trying to represent a number as a sequence of bytes,
using <code>reinterpret_cast</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>QContactId</span> <span>makeId</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>QString</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>managerName</span><span>,</span> <span>uint</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>QContactId</span><span>(</span><span>QStringLiteral</span><span>(</span><span>"qtcontacts:basic%1:"</span><span>).</span><span>arg</span><span>(</span><span>managerName</span><span>),</span> <span>QByteArray</span><span>(</span><span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>uint</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The order of bytes will be different on little endian and big endian systems!
The fix was adding this line to the beginning of the function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>qToLittleEndian</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will cause the bytes to be reversed on big endian systems.</p>
<h2>What remains unfixed</h2>
<p>There are still some bugs, which require deeper investigation, for example:</p>

We recently came across the study by 2015 Standard University that confirms our suspicions that they are indeed turning styrofoam into usable organic matter!</p>
<p>Their notes are not much different than ours, except their equipment (gel permeation chromatography, solid-state 13C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) was a little better than ours. I mean, we do have a microscope and a few 5-gallon buckets…</p>

Polystyrene (PS) is generally considered to be durable and resistant to biodegradation. Mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) from different sources chew and eat Styrofoam, a common PS product. The Styrofoam was efficiently degraded in the larval gut within a retention time of less than 24 h. Fed with Styrofoam as the sole diet, the larvae lived as well as those fed with a normal diet (bran) over a period of 1 month… Within a 16 day test period, 47.7% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 and the residue was egested as fecula with a limited fraction incorporated into biomass. Tests confirmed that the polystyrene was mineralized to CO2 and incorporated into lipids.</p></div></div></div><div id="x-section-3"><div><div><div><p>The mealworms are able to do this due to their gut bacteria (Exiguobacterium sp. strain YT2) that actually breaks down the polystyrene. The Stanford study uses a common mealworm (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) – we are using this same mealworm, but in addition to that we are also using what’s known as a “superworm” (the larvae of Zophobas morio), a type of darkling beetle, that has a lifespan of 3 to 15 years.</p>
<p>The superworm seems to be more aggressive, larger, more sturdy, and eats a lot more material. It also has the ability to live for up to a year in the larval stage just by keeping them all in constant contact of each other’s bodies. The other mealworm has a very short cycle.</p>

<p>Mineralization is the process of nutrients becoming available to plants. If you think about the carbon to nitrogen ratio – when it’s up 30:1 the bacteria need to the use the nitrogen to process the carbon. You often hear the term that the nitrogen is “unavailable,” “locked up,” or “bound.”</p>
<p>When the ratio drops to 25:1 the nitrogen becomes available for the plants.</p>
<p><strong>The fact that these worms are converting about half of the styrofoam they eat into carbon dioxide and the rest into mineralized organic material suggest that it has come full circle.</strong></p>

<p>We need to start thinking about how we’re going to leave a healthy planet for the generations beyond ourselves, and using mealworms to compost styrofoam is definitely thinking out of the box.</p>

We’ve done it for decades. We pick some
honored, time-tested examples—<wbr>Fibonacci numbers and factorial being leading
candidates—<wbr>and use them to teach the general idea. They’re so canonical they
come directly from the gods: you can find these in books by people like
Niklaus Wirth.</p><p>But I’m here to tell you they got it wrong, and everyone’s been getting it
wrong ever since. Students come away underwhelmed and baffled, and go on to
become the next generation of teachers who repeat this process. However, we
need not repeat this cycle; we have much better methods.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Some_.Canonical_.Examples)"></a>Some Canonical Examples</h3><p>Let’s start by looking at what’s wrong with our canonical examples.</p><h4>1.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Factorial)"></a>Factorial</h4><p>First off, almost nobody has ever needed to compute a factorial. I’ve been
programming for about 35 years and the only times I’ve needed to compute a
factorial was when doing recreational mathematics or using programming to
explore some especially thorny combinatorics problem. Otherwise, I’ve never had
any need for factorials.</p><p>Second, the answer isn’t <span>meaningful</span>. Quick, what’s the factorial of 13?
Most people have no idea and (related to the above) don’t care. There’s nothing
recognizable about the answer. The only reason most programmers recognize the
number 3628800 is because we’ve tested factorial on a “big enough number” to
confirm that it worked, not because we actually cared about it. If you adopt a
curriculum that asks students to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wk-examplar/">develop examples
before they write code</a>, students would be hard-pressed to write the answer
independently; many would resort to implementing it first and plugging in the
answer.</p><p>Third, factorial has poor numeric properties in most languages. Unless you have
built-in, automatic support for big numbers, you will soon either get answers
that print in odd-looking scientific notation, or worse, overflow (on many
languages, with default integers, factorial of 17 is -288522240).</p><p>Finally, many students have written factorial-like programs before, perhaps
even factorial itself, using loops. A natural question they (should!) ask an
instructor is, “Why should I do this again?” The answer, inevitably, is,
“Because I’m asking you to.” There’s no better way to turn off a student.</p><p>So let’s summarize the “recursion experience”: a useless problem, with
unrecognizable answers, with wonky-looking behavior, using an unnecessary new
technique that you’re forced to use “because”.</p><h4>1.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Fibonacci)"></a>Fibonacci</h4><p>Let’s turn our gaze to Fibonacci.</p><p>First off, almost nobody has ever needed to compute a Fibonacci number,
either. I’ve been programming for about 35 years and the only times I’ve needed
it was when doing recrea—<wbr>you see where this is going.<span><span><span>I do find them
useful to convert beween miles and kilometers, though.</span></span></span></p><p>Second, the answer isn’t meaningful, and students would again be hard-pressed
to write the answer independently (what, keep track of all those
calls?!?). Third, it has poor numeric properties: around 44, Fibonacci is
correct, then becomes negative (which is obviously incorrect), then immediately
again is a very reasonable-looking positive number that just happens to be
completely wrong. The main reason we haven’t cared for decades is because we
really just don’t have much use for Fibonacci numbers.</p><p>Finally, it has atrocious time-complexity.</p><p>So let’s summarize the “recursion experience”: a useless problem, with
unrecognizable answers, with wonky-looking behavior, that runs really sloooowly
(and worse, the slowness first creeps up on you stealthily and then suddenly
administers a hammer-blow to the back of your head). In fact, its main value is
as a function that you should <span>not</span> write (straightforwardly) recursively.</p><p>This is how we teach recursion.</p><h4>1.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Euclid_s_.Algorithm)"></a>Euclid’s Algorithm</h4><p>Oh, I’m not done.</p><p>Another famous mathematician, another famous function.</p><p>Okay, I’ll grant, many students have at least heard of the greatest common
divisor. They may vaguely recall using it in school for dealing with
fractions. So it has familiarity going for it.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useful in a context that <span>no longer makes
sense</span>. Once you have a programming language, you have a calculator. Unless
you’re implementing a calculator (and perhaps even then), you have no real need
to implement Euclid’s algorithm.</p><p>And even if you do, admit it: you don’t remember why Euclid’s algorithm
works. I certainly have to re-derive why it produces the right answer every
time I’ve implemented it (purely for illustrative purposes, every few
years). Otherwise, it’s just a mystical pattern.</p><p>So what’s the lesson we get from Euclid’s algorithm? That recursion is for
encoding mystical patterns for no-longer-useful functions? In fact, is
recursion useful for anything <span>other</span> than weird math functions?</p><h4>1.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Towers_of_.Hanoi)"></a>Towers of Hanoi</h4><p>Oh yes it is! Maybe that’s why we have this old standby.</p><p>First, we’ll start with some invented Eastern mysticism. Orientalism is always
a good pedagogic device, right?</p><p>Next, it’s a problem fraught with questions of representation: how exactly do
you represent the content of the towers? That is actually a somewhat
interesting question for a beginning student, but (a) it’s not obvious until
you’ve had some programming practice, and (b) it has absolutely nothing to do
with recursion. So you have a hard, unrelated sub-problem in the middle of your
example that “demonstrates” recursion. Doesn’t that utterly violate the
pedagogic principle of changing just one thing at a time so students can focus
on what’s salient? (And don’t forget, this is another problem with exponential
time behavior!)</p><p>Furthermore, if you don’t tell students the (recursive) solution and leave them
to figure it out for themselves, you haven’t given them a programming problem:
you’ve given them a puzzle. Those are different things. In particular, the
Towers of Hanoi is a particularly <span>difficult</span> kind of recursion—<wbr>oh, you
didn’t know there are different kinds of recursion? Read on.</p><p>Finally, again, does anyone care? Do students believe they would be called on
to help monks move disks around? What other problem is similar to this one? And
if there are any, do we teach them, or do we present these magnificently
isolated monks…in magnificent isolation?</p><p>What’s worse is that so many of these are fundamentally <span>static</span> problems:
there are only so many interesting inputs, and each one has a completely
deterministic solution, so once one builds up a table of outputs for standard
inputs, the problem is essentially solved. For such problems, it would be smart
(especially when the run-time complexity is exponential in the input) to just
stash the answers and never run the code again.<span><span><span>Yes, I know,
memoization.</span></span></span></p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Recursion_versus_.Cyclicity)"></a>Recursion versus Cyclicity</h3><p>Another standard, time-honored pedagogic device is the dumb joke: “to
understand recursion you must understand recursion”, and so on.</p><p>These confuse recursion with cyclicity.</p><p>If you don’t understand the difference, don’t use the dumb jokes.</p><p>If you do understand the difference, don’t use the dumb jokes then
either. They’re still <span>dumb</span> jokes.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Is_.Recursion_in_the_.Problem_)"></a>Is Recursion in the Problem?</h3><p>An attempt at a better answer might be that a <span>problem</span> is “inherently”
recursive. However, that’s just a limitation of viewpoint. There’s nothing more
inherently recursive than iterative about factorial. All the problems above can
be expressed even more declaratively, as in a mathematical specification, that
eliminates any implementation directive (e.g.: the greatest common divisor is the
<span>greatest</span>, <span>common</span>, <span>divisor</span>: the definition of the problem
says nothing about how to find it, and searching through all numbers to find
divisors that are common and taking the largest one is no less valid a
solution).</p><p>No, the essence lies elsewhere. But we’re getting closer.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.How_to_.Teach_.Recursion)"></a>How to Teach Recursion</h3><p>Wait up, I didn’t promise this. Check the title again.</p><p>But I know, I can’t just stop here. So I’ll give you a brief peek of how to
proceed.</p><p>In <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span> (<span>HTDP</span>), we have a rather different view of
recursion. The key idea is this.</p><h4>4.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Function_.Follows_.Form)"></a>Function Follows Form</h4><p>Where does recursion come from? <span>HTDP</span> argues that it arises from
<span>self-references in data</span>. That is, <span>recursive data suggest recursive
solutions</span>. This is the key insight you need for understanding recursion. Not
only does it make sense once you think about it, it also demonstrates why most
other approaches to teaching recursion are essentially incorrect.</p><p><span>HTDP</span> teaches a design “recipe”. In it, you describe your program’s (or
function’s) data structures, and identify self-references in these
data. Self-referential data are pretty straightforward: even kids can understand
them. For instance, even a child informed about biology can answer basic
questions like these:
</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p><span>- Does a child have (biological) parents?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Yes.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- How many?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Two, a (biological) male and (biological) female.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Does the female have parents?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Yes.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- How many?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Two, a (biological) mother and a (biological) father.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>- Does the male…</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>They can see where this goes. They grasp the idea of a (biological) family tree
pretty intuitively. They can similarly see other kinds of self-referential data
even at a young age, well before they program.</p><p>Next, <span>HTDP</span> explains how the structure of the data suggest a structure to the
solution. This solution structure is generic, and called the “template”. You
arrive at this entirely mechanically from the data structure, even before
you’ve contemplated the exact problem you’re trying to solve.</p><p>(The template is not a rule, it’s a suggestion. It helps you overcome the
“blank page” problem by offering the outline of a suggestion. Sometimes, the
template leads to a correct but insufficiently-efficient solution. Such a
solution is …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This is the fourth…and LAST…entry in my series of blog posts analyzing the accuracy of Ray Kurzweil’s predictions about what things would be like in 2019. These predictions come from his 1998 book&nbsp;<em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em>.&nbsp;You can view the previous installments of this series here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-1/">Part 1</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-2/">Part 2</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-3/">Part 3</a></p>



<p><strong><em>“An undercurrent of concern is developing with regard to the influence of machine intelligence. There continue to be differences between human and machine intelligence, but the advantages of human intelligence are becoming more difficult to identify and articulate. Computer intelligence is thoroughly interwoven into the mechanisms of civilization and is designed to be outwardly subservient to apparent human control. On the one hand, human transactions and decisions require by law a human agent of responsibility, even if fully initiated by machine intelligence. On the other hand, few decisions are made without significant involvement and consultation with machine-based intelligence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Technological advances have moved concerns over the influence of machine intelligence to the fore in developed countries. In many domains of skill previously considered hallmarks of intelligent thinking, such as driving vehicles, recognizing images and faces, analyzing data, writing short documents, and even diagnosing diseases, machines had achieved human levels of performance by the end of 2019. And in a few niche tasks, such as playing Go, chess, or poker, machines were superhuman. Eroded human dominance in these and other fields did indeed force philosophers and scientists to grapple with the meaning of “intelligence” and “creativity,” and made it harder yet more important to define how human thinking was still special and useful. </p>



<p>While the prospect of artificial general intelligence was still viewed with skepticism, there was no real doubt among experts and laypeople in 2019 that task-specific AIs and robots would continue improving, and without any clear upper limit to their performance. This made technological unemployment and the solutions for it frequent topics of public discussion across the developed world. In 2019, one of the candidates for the upcoming U.S. Presidential election, Andrew Yang, even made these issues central to his political platform. </p>



<p>If “algorithms” is another name for “computer intelligence” in the prediction’s text, then yes, it is woven into the mechanisms of civilization and is ostensibly under human control, but in fact drives human thinking and behavior. To the latter point, great alarm has been raised over how algorithms used by social media companies and advertisers affect sociopolitical beliefs (particularly, conspiracy thinking and closedmindedness), spending decisions, and mental health. </p>



<p>Human transactions and decisions still require a “human agent of responsibility”: Autonomous cars aren’t allowed to drive unless a human is in the driver’s seat, human beings ultimately own and trade (or authorize the trading of) all assets, and no military lets its autonomous fighting machines kill people without orders from a human. The only part of the prediction that seems wrong is the last sentence. Probably most decisions that humans make are done without consulting a “machine-based intelligence.” Consider that most daily purchases (e.g. – where to go for lunch, where to get gas, whether and how to pay a utility bill) involve little thought or analysis. A frighteningly large share of investment choices are also made instinctively, with benefit of little or no research. However, it should be noted that one area of human decision-making, dating, has become much more data-driven, and it was common in 2019 for people to use sorting algorithms, personality test results, and other filters to choose potential mates. </p>



<p><strong><em>“Public and private spaces are routinely monitored by machine intelligence to prevent interpersonal violence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Gunfire detection systems, which are comprised of networks of microphones emplaced across an area and which use machine intelligence to recognize the sounds of gunshots and to triangulate their origins, were emplaced in over 100 cities at the end of 2019. The dominant company in this niche industry, “ShotSpotter,” used human analysts to review its systems’ results before forwarding alerts to local police departments, so the systems were not truly automated, but nonetheless they made heavy use of machine intelligence. </p>



<p>Automated license plate reader cameras, which are commonly mounted next to roads or on police cars, also use machine intelligence and are widespread. The technology has definitely reduced violent crime, as it has allowed police to track down stolen vehicles and cars belonging to violent criminals faster than would have otherwise been possible. </p>



<p>In some countries, surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology monitor many public spaces. The cameras compare the people they see to mugshots of criminals, and alert the local police whenever a wanted person is seen. China is probably the world leader in facial recognition surveillance, and in a famous 2018 case, it used the technology to find one criminal among 60,000 people who attended a concert in Nanchang. </p>



<p>At the end of 2019, several organizations were researching ways to use machine learning for real-time recognition of violent behavior in surveillance camera feeds, but the systems were not accurate enough for commercial use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“People attempt to protect their privacy with near-unbreakable encryption technologies, but privacy continues to be a major political and social issue with each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>In 2013, National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden leaked a massive number of secret documents, revealing the true extent of his employer’s global electronic surveillance. The world was shocked to learn that the NSA was routinely tracking the locations and cell phone call traffic of millions of people, and gathering enormous volumes of data from personal emails, internet browsing histories, and other electronic communications by forcing private telecom and internet companies (e.g. – Verizon, Google, Apple) to let it secretly search through their databases. Together with British intelligence, the NSA has the tools to spy on the electronic devices and internet usage of almost anyone on Earth. </p>

<p>Snowden also revealed that the NSA unsurprisingly had sophisticated means for cracking encrypted communications, which it routinely deployed against people it was spying on, but that even its capabilities had limits. Because some commercially available encryption tools were too time-consuming or too technically challenging to crack, the NSA secretly pressured software companies and computing hardware manufacturers to install “backdoors” in their products, which would allow the Agency to bypass any encryption their owners implemented. </p>



<p>During the 2010s, big tech titans like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple also came under major scrutiny for quietly gathering vast amounts of personal data from their users, and reselling it to third parties to make hundreds of billions of dollars. The decade also saw many epic thefts of sensitive personal data from corporate and government databases, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. </p>



<p>With these events in mind, it’s quite true that concerns over digital privacy and confidentiality of personal data have become “major political and social issues,” and that there’s growing displeasure at the fact that “each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” The response has been strongest in the European Union, which, in 2018, enacted the most stringent and impactful law to protect the digital rights of individuals–the “General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR). </p>



<p>Widespread awareness of secret government surveillance programs and of the risk of personal electronic messages being made public thanks to hacks have also bolstered interest in commercial encryption. “Whatsapp” is a common text messaging app with built-in end-to-end encryption. It was invented in 2016 and had 1.5 billion users by 2019. “Tor” is a web browser with built-in encryption that became relatively common during the 2010s after it was learned even the NSA couldn’t spy on people who used it. Additionally, virtual private networks (VPNs), which provide an intermediate level of data privacy protection for little expense and hassle, are in common use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“The existence of the human underclass continues as an issue. While there is sufficient prosperity to provide basic necessities (secure housing and food, among others) without significant strain to the economy, old controversies persist regarding issues of responsibility and opportunity.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>It’s unclear whether this prediction pertained to the U.S., to rich countries in aggregate, or to the world as a whole, and “underclass” is not defined, so we can’t say whether it refers only to desperately poor people who are literally starving, or to people who are better off than that but still under major daily stress due to lack of money. Whatever the case, by any reasonable definition, there is an “underclass” of people in almost every country. </p>



<p>In the U.S. and other rich countries, welfare states provide even the poorest people with access to housing, food, and other needs, though there are still those who go without because severe mental illness and/or drug addiction keep them stuck in homeless lifestyles and render them too behaviorally disorganized to apply for government help or to be admitted into free group housing. Some people also live in destitution in rich countries because they are illegal immigrants or fugitives with arrest warrants, and contacting the authorities for welfare assistance would lead to their detection and …</p></div></article></div>

<p>People sometimes ask me for robotics resources. There aren’t many high quality internet-first lists available on this topic, so I made one I can link to. I’ll continually update this list so feel free to give <strong><a href="mailto:arthur@allshire.org">suggestions if things are missing or you have better links</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There’s some more interesting comments on this topic in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25608932">Hacker News discussion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-advice">General Advice</h3>
<p>Robotics can be overwhelming from the sheer number of fields involved (everything from mathematics to physics to computer science to mechanical engineering enters in). Remember: <em>you won’t start as an expert in anything; you can’t end up as an expert in everything</em>. Also learning will not be a linear path; outside of courses, acquire knowledge as you need it in projects.</p>
<p>Try as much as possible to avoid this antipattern (I still struggle)…
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An illustrated guide to learning absolutely nothing <a href="https://t.co/bKIMX2r6iU">pic.twitter.com/bKIMX2r6iU</a></p>— Eugene Vinitsky (@EugeneVinitsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/EugeneVinitsky/status/1343701831210307586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h4 id="communities">Communities</h4>
<p>Instead of attempting to pre-load your head with maximum theory, try to get as much <strong>practical experience</strong> as possible (see below), whether that be joining a club, lab, or if you’re lucky in an internship or job.</p>
<p>It is incredibly hard to do something on your own without some kind of <a href="https://dcgross.com/the-environment-diet/">environmental forcing function</a>.  If at all possible, embed yourself in a community of people working on problems of interest to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST robotics competition</a> - Simply put, FRC was the awesomest thing ever for me. If you can find a team, beg them to let you participate…</li>
<li>If you are a student at a university - try joining a lab!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately outside of these robotics is currently not an easy field to break into. The sheer number of ‘moving parts’ to a (useful) robotic system - from hardware to drivers to algorithms to user interfaces - means it’s tough to hack together a demo in a few weeks, get users, and bootstrap / apply to some accelerator like in many software projects. Making the jump from “hacker” to “career”, even with all the knowledge in the world is hard. If you know solutions to this, let me know.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><strong>Computer programming</strong> - this is essential if you want to do basically anything in robotics. Python and <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html">C++</a> are the most important languages to know - learn both.
Familiarity with basic data-structures and algorithms concepts is helpful for problem solving and in some fields like motion planning but initially less vital than you may think - it’s not necessary to be a master leetcoder.</p>
<p><strong>Maths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Linear algebra - vital in most topics beyond basic basic control. If you want to become an expert, <a href="https://linear.axler.net/">Axler’s book</a> is good (though I didn’t make it through the whole thing 😳).</li>
<li>Calculus - fundamental differential calculus and partial derivatives is required to understand optimisation algorithms which are everywhere in robo.</li>
<li>The book <a href="https://pimbook.org/">A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics</a> is actually a solid foundation if you want a quick overview of both of the above topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-concepts">Important Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> isn’t bad if you want to learn the basics (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">95%</a> of controllers used in industry are PID). Ben Recht’s <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">blog post</a> is also decent.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee392m/ee392m.1056/">These course slides</a> are good for basics and more advanced concepts like <strong>MPC</strong> .</li>
<li><a href="https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/">Control challenges</a> is a set of (very fun) challenges that will allow you to test your ability to write basic controllers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8319J1BEHwM">This talk</a> from FIRST Robotics team 254 is great for going over the basics of robot control and showing how we can improve on basic PID using simple interpolation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematics and Mechanics of Robotics &amp; Manipulation</strong> - This set of <a href="http://www.nathanratliff.com/pedagogy">notes by Nathan Ratliff</a> provides a great overview of many topics.  These <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/robotics-n-intelligent-systems/rsl-dam/documents/RobotDynamics2017/RD_HS2017script.pdf">notes on robot dynamics</a> from ETH are also great.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python">Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python</a> is a great read with interactive notebook examples throughout. Good for building intuition on both Bayesian statistics as well as how filters for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems work. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Technical_description_and_context">wiki article on the Kalman Filter</a>  and <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/">this blog post</a> is also well written if you want a shorter overview.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning &amp; Neural Networks</strong> - Focus less on the basics of machine learning than the application of neural networks as function approximators, which is their primary utility as perception and decision making modules in robotics. <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Michael Nielsen’s book</a> is my favourite resource in this regard. The <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">canonical deep learning book</a> is good reference but you don’t need to read the whole thing - pick out specific topics as required.</p>
<p><strong>Path and motion planning</strong> - Wiki has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning">decent overview</a> and details some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree">basic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">algorithms</a>. I haven’t read it but this book is apparently a <a href="http://lavalle.pl/planning/">good comprehensive guide</a>, and a course based on it is available <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/courses/winter2019motionplanning/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> &amp; more on controllers - Ben Recht’s “<a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">outsider’s tour of RL</a>” provides a nice concise overview of many relevant concepts and ties them to classical control. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/spinning-up-in-deep-rl/">Spinning up in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> is another great reference on the topic and exhibits many of the most important algorithms for research in the field.</p>
<h3 id="other-topics--resources">Other Topics &amp; Resources</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>For beginners looking for a single book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1">Elements of Robotics</a> looks like an a great resource, and I’m only sorry it didn’t exist when I was starting. Provides self-contained introductions to many topics listed, pitched at a level high-schoolers / beginning university students can understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846286414">Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25609653">apparently</a> an all time classic covering many topics listed above..</li>
<li>Convex Optimisation is used in everything from simulators to controllers and beyond. I intend to read the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">canonical book</a> (free) at some point.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="courses">Courses</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Berkley <strong><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa19/">Advanced Robotics</a></strong> course provides relatively self contained expositions of many topics in lecture format (don’t be scared off by the ‘advanced' moniker, it’s not that incomprehensible 😅.)</li>
<li>Russ Tedrake’s courses on <a href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/">Underactuated Robotics</a> and <a href="http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/">Manipulation</a> seem really high quality (I haven’t gotten around to doing them myself yet).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>The space of software is so vast I couldn’t fit it all here… <a href="http://jslee02.github.io/awesome-robotics-libraries/">this list</a> provides a much more comprehensive overview in this regard. Some utilities I’ve found useful are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ros.org/install/">ROS</a> is very widely used many projects, worth picking up the basics.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html">RLLib</a> has implementations of many reinforcement learning algorithms and support for distributed training.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="simulators">Simulators</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite">Robosuite</a> is great for robot learning and has many richly-designed built-in environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym">Isaac Gym</a> is recently released and provides extremely fast samples for reinforcement learning. It does this by running thousands of environments in parallel on the GPU (in almost all other sims physics is run on the CPU meaning you can only run one environment at once). You can train tasks in minutes that previously took hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interesting-lines-of-work">Interesting Lines of Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Randomisation</strong>  is highly underrated, and will likely get more important as we get faster simulators which are able to generalize better. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/">Learning Dexterity</a> from OpenAI is a very interesting paper, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRupIVknV-A">line</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01728.pdf">work</a> around improving simulator parameter show two different and interesting takes on this powerful approach.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> in reinforcement learning has shown promising results in getting behaviour that generalises, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08399.pdf">DeepGait</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15119">UniCon</a> paper being two interesting examples.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03135">DexPilot</a> is a really cool low-cost system for teleoperation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGE-deYfb8I">video</a>). Partially inspired <a href="https://allshire.org/teleop/">my piece on teleoperation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Probably my weakest area… up for recommendations about specific great resources.
<a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">OnShape</a> is a great resource for designing things and is great even with minimal CAD experience (even I am able to use it!)</p>
<p><a href="https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/">Open Dynamic Robot initiative</a> has many robots that you can build with off-the-shelf components.</p>
<p>Others' recommendations -</p>
<p>In the HN thread, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25612255">contingencies had some tips</a> on how to get started yourself on the hardware side.</p>
<p>I’m told cadathons such as those <a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/tech/2020/03/20-years-of-model-mania.html">organised by Solidworks</a> are a good way to get started. They also have a <a href="https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/14/cswa-exam-prep-course">series of lessons</a> on CADding fundamentals.</p>
<p><a href="https://grabcad.com/">GrabCAD</a> has big libries of pre-existing models you can use.</p>
<h3 id="business--higher-level-thinking">Business &amp; Higher-Level Thinking</h3>
<p>Very interesting side of things, however there is somewhat of a paucity of great resources (I’m pretty sure many in the space refrain from publishing their theses.) Please send if you have others I have missed!</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Dempsey has some <a href="http://www.michaeldempsey.me/archive.html">great writing</a> on the business of autonomy.</li>
<li>Trucks VC has an interesting newsletter about <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/">autonomy</a>.</li>
<li>Jessy Lin wrote <a href="http://jessylin.com/blog/">some essays</a> on topic surrounding the economics and future of autonomy and HRI.</li>
<li><a href="https://rodneybrooks.com/blog/">Rodney Brooks</a> makes predictions in the robotics space on a yearly basis and has some good rigorous thinking on there.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/">EE Times</a> has news and frequent opinion pieces in this space.</li>
<li>Though inexperienced, I sometimes try my best to <a href="https://allshire.org/">write on this topic</a> :)</li>
