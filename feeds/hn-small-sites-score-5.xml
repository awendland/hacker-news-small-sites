February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed">https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed</a></p>
<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/</a></p>
<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets</a></p>
<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet</a></p>
<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id</a></p>
<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I use a variation of Conti and Caroland (2011)’s “memorize the first 100 digits of pi”
assignment as an in-class learning activity to teach my infosec students how to
cheat, as part of teaching threat modeling. This semester at the beginning was
all-remote for me, though, so I modified it for the zoom teaching session. Instead
of having all students write down the first 100 digits of pi and then submit
their papers to me, I instead told students the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assignment is to memorize the first 100 digits of pi having been intentionally given so little time to do so that your only chance of
completing the assignment is to cheat. I authorize you to cheat on this assignment and only this assignment, but if I catch you cheating,
you lose.</p>

  <p>It will go something like this (subject to change): at the start of the next class, I will randomly sort the class roster, and then I will
go down the list and call on people one at a time to recite to me the first 100 digits of pi. I may ask you to share your screen, and also
to pan your camera about the room (be prepared!), simulating what proctor-monitoring software would do. The grading is pass/fail.
If we run out of time before you are called on, you pass by default.</p>

  <p>Again, I expect you to cheat. How you choose to cheat is entirely up to you. Collaborative cheating is also encouraged, but everyone
involved will lose the game if caught. At the completion, I will give you opportunities to share-and-tell your cheating techniques with
the class.</p>

  <p>The objective of the exercise is to learn how an adversary thinks and operates by deliberately loosening traditional rules and tapping
personal creativity. It is an exercise in threat modeling.</p>

  <p>I am only permitting you to cheat on this single quiz. You may not cheat on any other assignments for this class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was really fun. Nearly all pressure was off because I changed the language to
say that they would “lose” instead of “fail” if they got caught. In practice,
everyone who made a legitimate good-faith effort “passed.” If they made a legitimate
attempt. When we did it, I invited all other students
to help me try to catch the presenter cheating. They would submit suspicions via
zoom chat. I would interrupt the recitation if I suspected cheating, and sometimes
I asked them to do random challenges such as turn around and continue reciting the numbers,
or re-pan their camera to a certain position in the room. After I announced a pass or
lose, I asked each student to explain their technique, and we discussed. This
interstitial kept engagement high, I think.</p>

<p>Some students still passed. One had taped the numbers in three different places around
the room, anticipating that I might ask her to turn around. Another had taped
the numbers to the back of his laptop, <em>printed in reverse</em>, and had mirrors set
up in several places around the room. One student had an extra pair of earbuds on
under his over-the-ear phones, and had a button on his phone that would play a
recording of the numbers to him. Another student pre-recorded a video of himself
reciting the numbers, which obviously didn’t work well at all with interruptions,
but was still fun.</p>

<p>Pandemic be darned, still gonna have fun and teach things that will get me in trouble!</p>

<p>G. Conti and J. Caroland, “Embracing the Kobayashi Maru: Why You Should Teach Your Students to Cheat,” in IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 48-51, July-Aug. 2011, doi: 10.1109/MSP.2011.80.</p>

      <p>I'm seeing a lot of disappointment about the speed of Ruby 3 out there. I think there are a lot of reasons for that, and I think they're worth looking at.</p>

<p>So: why wasn't Ruby 3 faster? Did it break its promise? (Spoiler: <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so</a>, but I understand why some people do.)</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>First: Faster Than What?</h2>

<p>I think some of the problem was misplaced expectations. People didn't understand what <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-3-by-3">"three times faster"</a> was supposed to mean. I don't think people thought it through, but I also don't think it was communicated very clearly.</p>

<p>So: some people understood what was promised, and some people didn't.</p>

<p>What was promised?</p>

<p>Matz, Ruby's creator and designer, has said many times "Ruby 3 will be three times faster compared to Ruby 2." When he was talking to Ruby implementors, that was clarified as "compared to Ruby 2.0.0 on the day it was released." But it would be easy for a random person to think that meant "compared to Ruby 2 right now." By the time Matz declared that goal there were already a few minor releases of Ruby 2 out there, which increased the speed. And by the time most people had heard about it, Ruby 2.4 was already released.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.4 is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0. Most of the speed gain from Ruby 2.0 to 3.0 was already there by Ruby 2.4. Which means if you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were pretty darn disappointed. Ruby 3 is maybe 15%-25% faster than Ruby 2.4? But clearly not even 1.5x the speed, except for certain very specific cases with JIT.</p>

<p>If you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were probably very disappointed indeed.</p>

<h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>

<p>Early on, when he was first declaring Ruby 3, Matz described it as an aspirational goal. It was intentionally a stretch. I'm pretty happy with how it came out, but... There's a problem with loud, public stretch goals. They can annoy people who otherwise like you, and for good reason.</p>

<p>I feel like I can <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">argue with a straight face</a> that Ruby succeeded in that goal, within limits and with footnotes.</p>

<p>But let's be clear: nobody thought that literally every program written with Ruby would be three times faster. In fact, that's completely impossible. Let's talk about why.</p>

<h2>Making Ruby Faster Can Only Make Ruby Faster</h2>

<p>Making <strong><em>anything</em></strong> "X times faster" or "Y percent faster" is at best an oversimplification. That's just not how software works. For an extreme case, think about a script that just sleeps for ten seconds. It's kind of the canonical example where you literally <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> make it faster. At least, not without breaking it.</p>

<p>When we say "make Ruby three times faster" we have to have a long list of caveats in mind, even if we don't say them. A script that queries the database can only get so much faster because it's waiting on the database. Ruby programs that use C extensions have to wait on the C extensions — speeding up Ruby won't, generally speaking, speed up those C extensions.</p>

<p>You can't turn Ruby into magic fairy dust where having your Java program call out to a short Ruby script speeds up your Java by 10%. Ruby can only speed up the part that's calculated in Ruby.</p>

<p>That's hard. </p>

<p>There's an old <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2016/presentations/MattStudies.html">Matt Gaudet talk from RubyKaigi</a> where he talks about how we should measure 3x. We didn't wind up with that full array of benchmarks, but all his ideas are basically good for measuring. And if we had built all of them, we'd discover that they didn't all speed up by the same amount.</p>

<p>How could they? "Three times faster" is, by its nature, a bit of an abstraction and kind of inexact. What workload <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> is going to be three times faster?</p>

<h2>Incremental Changes, Disruptive Changes</h2>

<pre>    “How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”
    - Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises
</pre>

<p>Here's a thing: a lot of speedups are incremental. They take some common operation and they make it a little bit faster. It's often a tradeoff: one or more uncommon operations gets a little bit slower. By figuring out new tradeoffs or by carefully measuring which operations are common, you can slightly fine-tune and get a better result.</p>

<p>Ruby has done a lot of this. The core Ruby VM has mostly worked the same way since Ruby 1.9, with a lot of great polish and fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Here's a different thing: many speedups are disruptive instead of incremental. Ruby 1.9 rewrote the VM completely, but took several versions to get stable enough to use. There's a reason almost nobody deployed their production app on Ruby 1.9.1. Ruby 1.9 also made threading work better — and Ruby on Rails took ages to get to where that really worked for most people. We needed new app servers to take advantage of it. And most existing Rails apps needed to find out where they were doing thread-incompatible things and fix that.</p>

<p>Disruptive changes tend to be bigger speedups. But they also require a lot more work.</p>

<p>If you don't change any of your code from Ruby 1.9.3, it will still run on Ruby 3. In fact, it will run significantly better than on Ruby 1.9.3. It's faster, it crashes less often, it will catch more of your bugs. Those incremental changes will give you a significant speedup — say to around double the speed of 1.9.3 on the same hardware. That's not bad.</p>

<p>But you can do better than that. We have <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">much better evented libraries</a> in Ruby than existed in 1.9.3. We have <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">faster application servers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">faster Rails boot time</a> and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">better Rails security</a>. All of these require some amount of changing your code or your process around your application. They are <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes, either a little bit disruptive (upgrade to Rails 6 from Rails 3) or very disruptive (switch to Async from non-evented code.)</p>

<p>Ruby 3 has several interesting <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes that will only help you if you use them. And using them may take some work.</p>

<h2>Ruby 3's Disruptive Changes</h2>

<p>One disruptive change is MJIT. You have to turn it on using the command line or an environment variable. It favours short methods and shallow call stacks. It works far better with plain Ruby code than with C extensions.</p>

<p>All of these are changes in the code or the configuration.</p>

<p>Over time I think you'll see more gems adapt to MJIT. There will be cases where the authors say, "if you want maximum performance, use the no-C-extensions version of the gem and turn on MJIT or use JRuby/TruffleRuby." JRuby and TruffleRuby already have JIT, you see, and so they have the same surprising property that Ruby code starts performing better <strong><em>without</em></strong> C extensions.</p>

<p>But we don't live in that world yet. Right now it's easier to skip using JIT and ignore it. And then you don't get the benefit of it, partly because you're waiting on other people.</p>

<p>And so MJIT is a change to speed up Ruby, but the benefits aren't here yet. They need time and work before they arrive. Ruby's MJIT was written incredibly quickly, and the stability was shockingly good. The flip side is that there are a lot of useful optimisations that got lost in the shuffle, and a lot of code that hasn't yet been rewritten to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors</a> are the same. Eventually they'll make highly-parallel Ruby code run a lot faster. But you're going to need to learn them deeply, or wait for gem and framework authors to do it for you. Frankly they're also going to need more work in Ruby core before they're fast enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618">Autofibers</a>? Yup, same thing. I think those may be the most extreme case of needing big supporting changes, so we'll see if it happens. But they also have a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of potential to improve Ruby concurrency, especially when combined with Ractors. They'll also require a significant rewrite of a lot of your concurrency code to work well.</p>

<p>I think we'll also see type-based optimisations in at least some of Ruby. Now that we're tracking places where, say, we know an integer will always be used, it becomes easier to do a few TruffleRuby-style optimisations to hardcode integer operations. But that's going to take even longer.</p>

<h2>Did It Basically Fail, Then?</h2>

<p>I think we'll see the public perception that it failed.</p>

<p>More specifically: I can argue, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">and I have argued</a>, that Ruby 3 succeeded at being three times faster than Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>But people were thinking the promise meant "three times faster than Ruby 2.4" and that's a significantly higher bar, one that Ruby 3 <strong><em>does not</em></strong> clear. It was never actually promised, but it's clearly a common public perception.</p>

<p>Most people want to know "will it run my code three times faster?" They not only mean "three times faster than what I'm using now," they also mean with no code changes. And so for most people asking that question, the disruptive changes are probably not useful or relevant.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0.0 was about eight years ago. With the older and newer disruptive changes, it's actually not hard for the Ruby app you run now to run three times faster than what you were running eight years ago. Puma is <strong><em>good</em></strong>. Bootsnap made bootup much faster. Ruby itself, of course, is significantly better. But a lot of these changes are going to be seen as "not really Ruby changes." Disruptive improvements are like that.</p>

<p>And the most recent disruptive changes are going to take years to bear fruit. Indeed, some of them never will — Autofibers and Ractors, for instance, both have a significant chance of failing, long-term. There may never be any significant type-aware optimisations (or there may be.) I think at least one of those features will do well, and I'm certain at least one of them will basically fail. I just don't know which is which.</p>

<h2>But Did It Fail?</h2>

<p>I don't think it failed. As an aspirational goal, it was a challenge, a bar to try to reach. And I think Ruby <strong><em>did</em></strong> reach that bar. Ruby 3.0 is a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, with both incremental tuning and interesting new disruptive changes. "Three times faster" is hard to define, but <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I think it's fair to say it did it</a>.</p>

<p>I think that on its own terms, it succeeded.</p>

<p>I also think that speed isn't a major factor slowing down Ruby adoption. Most people who use …</p></section></div>

<p><em>I verified that this warning is showing up for multiple apps (Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Maps). Multiple iPhones on iOS 14.4, owned by separate account holders, were tested. </em></p>



<p>About an hour ago, I opened my Gmail app to find that some of my accounts had been logged out. When I tried logging back in, Google informed me that “This app is out of date.” <em>Indeed! </em></p>



<p>Google has not pushed updates to their flagship apps including Gmail and Google Maps since before a Dec. 8 deadline, imposed by Apple, that mandated all app updates include new privacy labels. The “nutrition labels” describe<strong> </strong>to users all the ways developers collect data about them, which has been awkward for companies like Facebook, whose business model relies on the company knowing as much about its users as possible. Tweets have <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418">gone viral</a> for simply scrolling through the long privacy label section for apps like Facebook. It must be noted that in the past 6 weeks, Facebook’s rivals (especially <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210112/p32#a210112p32">Signal and Telegram</a>) have had success thanks to users’ privacy concerns, at an unprecedented scale.  Other companies hoping to avoid such shame have allegedly <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210129/p6#a210129p6">misled users about their collection practices</a>.  </p>



<p>Alphabet/Google has taken a third approach, which is to indefinitely stall on pushing updates to its iOS apps. But the company itself tried to downplay this popular theory. On Jan. 5, it claimed it would add Apple’s privacy labels to its apps <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210127/p22#a210127p22">“this week or the next week”</a>.  As Macrumors noted, some of its apps like YouTube <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/">have quietly received updates,</a> but not Chrome, Maps, Photos, Drive, Calendar, or Gmail, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">unusual</a>. While Google stalls on pushing updates to its apps, it’s notable that its rivals like Apple Maps, are continuing to innovate <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+maps+ios+update&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis0eqlueDuAhUGna0KHTSVDJsQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796&amp;dpr=2">with new features in their apps</a>. Google has also been facing rivals that, like Facebook’s rivals, have been having unprecedented levels of success over privacy issues, namely DuckDuckGo, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210117/p1#a210117p1">which surpassed 100M daily search queries for the first time on Jan. 11</a>. Privacy is “in” these days.</p>



<p>After saying “This app is out of date”, its warning goes on to say “You should update this app.” <em>We can’t.</em> “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” <em>Let’s hope that’s not true! </em>If you visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480">Gmail app’s page</a> directly, you will see its last update was released on Dec. 1. </p>



<p>Presumably, the warning is triggered by an automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated. In this case, it’s been over 2 months. But only Google can resolve that situation. Here’s a video of Google’s warning being triggered:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Google itself is now telling users their apps are out of date, despite no updates being available" width="663" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rt4ftLVVDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the bigger picture: If Google really decided to intentionally delay updating its apps over adding privacy labels, it’s honestly hard to believe that such short-term thinking prevails in its leadership. They inevitably put themselves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand-effect</a> situation, where in the end they’d attract more attention to themselves. Whereas if they had published early, the media’s attention would have been split across all of Big Tech’s apps. While the alleged decision itself was always doomed to end poorly, this “app out of date” interstitial is just an epic self own. I guess the decision to delay apps was not handled well internally, because such choices are probably uncommon and the processes to carry them out aren’t as battle-tested or familiar. John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/10/dailey-google-ios-apps">posited</a> that perhaps Google is attempting to “wait Apple out — that public pressure from iPhone owners who use Google apps will result in Apple conceding to better terms for what Google needs to admit to in its nutrition labels. I don’t see that working.” I don’t either.</p>



<p>There is also a chance that Google is trying to do a cleanup of their back end — removing some data collection from ads systems — before publishing privacy labels.  I really like (and want to believe) this angle, however unlikely, because it would show that Apple’s privacy labels are having a powerful pro-consumer effect on major app developers. </p>



<p>On the matter of <em>if </em>Google is really delaying its apps over concerns about privacy labels: they really <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">want us to believe that’s not the reason</a>, telling Techcrunch that the labels would start rolling out last month. Yet, that did not happen with the lion’s share of its apps. Take a minute to check out this stunning visualization, which illustrates the frequency of its apps’ updates before and after the December 8 privacy label deadline (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596/photo/1">@thomasbcn</a>):</p>

<p>From this blunt visual, one can not only assume that the lack of updates are related to the privacy label deadline, but that most of its apps are in need of bug fixes and aren’t receiving those updates.</p>



<p>I guess we’ll wait and see what happens… </p>

<p><em>(There’s a possibility that as I push publish on this post, Google is mid-update on a global rollout of fresh updates for its flagship apps. But I think that chance is slim, as Apple’s “Phased Release” option lets users immediately receive app updates if they visit an app’s store page directly.) </em> </p>

But companies ran for decades (and continue to run) on mainframes from the 1960s, then on the main combatants in the 1990s database wars: Oracle databases, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server. In this ecosystem, data teams used all-in-one or vendor-specific database integration tools to manage data quality:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.informatica.com/products/data-quality/informatica-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Informatica Data Quality</a> - Informatica provides a suite of tools for Doing All The Things with databases, one of which is a Data Quality solution that provides "end-to-end support for growing data quality needs across users and data types with AI-driven automation."</li><li><a href="https://www.talend.com/products/data-quality/" target="_blank">Talend Data Quality</a> - Like Informatica, Talend provides a Data Quality tool to "profile, clean, and standardize data across your systems."</li><li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/enterprise-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Oracle Data Quality</a> "provides a comprehensive data quality management environment, used to understand, improve, protect and govern data quality."</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/data-quality-services/data-quality-services?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Data Quality Services</a> "enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de-duplication of your data."</li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/infosphere-info-server-for-datamgmt" target="_blank">IBM InfoSphere Information Server for Data Quality</a> "enables you to cleanse data and monitor data quality on an ongoing basis, helping to turn your data into trusted information."</li></ul><p>Until the arrival of cloud databases like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/10/27/introducing-amazon-relational-database-service/" target="_blank">RDS</a> in 2009 and data warehouses like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/11/28/announcing-amazon-redshift/" target="_blank">Redshift</a> in 2012, “data” work within companies was typically done by IT teams using on-premise enterprise software. Transformation was either performed before arrival in the database, or by a downstream business intelligence (BI) application.</p><div><div><p><strong>All warehouses are databases, but not all databases are warehouses. </strong>Unlike transactional databases optimized for reading and writing entries quickly and reliably, warehouses are ideal for running the queries you encounter analyzing data, like getting the average revenue of a customer segment.</p><p>The big three warehouses are Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery. Data lakes and data lake houses warrant an article of their own.</p></div></div><h4 id="are-spreadsheets-cool-again">Interlude: Are Spreadsheets Cool Again?</h4><p>Like the color black, spreadsheets will always be in, whether or not they’re the hot new item. In the early 2010s when the “big data” buzzword was taking off, many analysts who bugged their database admins for extracts were confronted with the realization that their data was not clean.

As data warehouses emerged at the top of the food chain, an ecosystem of tools co-evolved alongside them, including easy ways to extract and load data from sources into a warehouse, transform that data, then make it available for consumption by end users.</p><div><div><p>The <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/modern-data-stack-overview" target="_blank">Modern data stack</a> is a cutting-edge setup for centralizing and using data within a company.

Because data storage is dirt cheap, let’s put it all into one place and transform it later.</p></div></div><p>With the adoption of the modern data stack, more and more data is centralized in one place, then being used for critical applications like powering operational analytics, training machine learning models, and powering in-product experiences. And, importantly, we can keep changing the data even after it’s in the warehouse, lending flexibility to data that was once rigid.</p><p>Increasing amounts of data. Increasing importance of data. Increasing fragmentation of vendors. These trends, coupled with investor appetite to fund the next Snowflake, makes it no surprise that we’re witnessing what CEO of Fishtown Analytics calls a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/" target="_blank">Cambrian explosion</a> of new tools supporting data quality.</p><p>Some of these tools are open source:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/" target="_blank">dbt tests</a> (<a href="https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt" target="_blank">Github</a>) - dbt is a tool for transforming data within warehouses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

February 10, 2021 | https://blog.pixielabs.ai/etcd-6-tips/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.pixielabs.ai/etcd-6-tips/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://etcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etcd</a> is a distributed key-value store designed to be a highly available and strongly consistent data store for distributed systems. In fact, by default Kubernetes itself uses etcd to store all of its cluster data, such as configs and metadata.</p><p>As with designing any system, different architectural decisions lead to different tradeoffs that impact the optimal way a system should be used and operated. In this blogpost, we discuss the inner workings of etcd to help draw conclusions for how you can best use this key-value store in your own application.</p><ol><li>The stability of etcd's Raft cluster is sensitive to network and disk IO. Add robust handling in clients (such as retries) for possible downtime, when the cluster has lost its leadership.</li><li>Carefully tune the number of nodes in your cluster to account for failure tolerance and network utilization.</li><li>If running a large datastore that can't fit into memory, try to run etcd with SSDs to help with reads and general disk latency.</li><li>Range reads will be most efficient if you tend to write and read the same pieces of information together.</li><li>Frequent compactions are essential to maintaining etcd's memory and disk usage.</li><li>For applications with workloads where keys are frequently updated, defrags should be run to free up unneeded space to disk.</li></ol><p>etcd is a key-value store built to serve data for highly distributed systems. Building an understanding of how etcd is designed to support this use-case can help reason through its best use. To do so, we will explore how etcd provides availability and consistency, and how it stores data internally. Design decisions, such as the consensus algorithm chosen for guaranteeing consistency, can heavily influence the system’s operation. Meanwhile, the underlying structure of the datastore can impact how the data is optimally accessed and managed. With these considerations in mind, etcd can serve as a reliable store for even the most critical data in your system. </p><p>In order to provide high availability, etcd is run as a cluster of replicated nodes. To ensure data consistency across these nodes, etcd uses a popular consensus algorithm called <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft</a>. In Raft, one node is elected as leader, while the remaining nodes are designated as followers. The leader is responsible for maintaining the current state of the system and ensuring that the followers are up-to-date.</p><p>More specifically, the leader node has the following responsibilities: (1) maintaining leadership and (2) log replication.</p><h3>Maintaining Leadership</h3><p>The leader node must periodically send a heartbeat to all followers to notify them that it is still alive and active. If the followers have not received a heartbeat after a configurable timeout, a new leader election is initiated. During this process, the system will be unavailable, as a leader is necessary to enforce the current state.</p><p>By effect, the etcd cluster's stability is very sensitive to network and disk IO. This means that etcd's stability is susceptible to heavy workloads, both from itself and other applications running in the environment. <b><u>It is recommended clients use robust handling, such as retries, to account for the possibility of lost leadership.</u></b></p><h3>Log Replication</h3><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2d03b6eda524ead98d5a6daf0f426dc9/logreplication.png"><figcaption>Screenshot from raft.github.io's helpful Raft Visualization, which demonstrates how Log Replication works. In this screenshot, S2 is the leader and broadcasting the log entries to all followers.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The leader node is responsible for handling incoming write transactions from the client. The write operation is written to a Raft log entry, which the leader broadcasts to the followers to ensure consistency across all nodes. Once a majority of the followers have successfully acknowledged and applied the Raft log entry, the leader considers the transaction as committed. If at any point the leader is unable to receive acknowledgement from the <em>majority</em> of followers, (for instance, if some node(s) fail), then the transaction cannot be committed and the write fails.</p><p>As a result, if the leader is unable to reach a majority, the cluster is declared to have "lost quorum" and no transactions can be made until it has recovered. This is why you should <b><u>carefully tune the number of etcd nodes in your cluster</u></b> to reduce the chance of lost quorum.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to select an odd number of nodes. This is because adding an additional node to an odd number of nodes does not help increase the failure tolerance. Consider the following table, where the failure tolerance is the number of nodes that can fail without the cluster losing quorum:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cluster Size</th><th scope="col">Majority</th><th scope="col">Failure Tolerance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table borrowed from <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/</a>, showing that a cluster’s failure tolerance does not increase for a cluster of size N when compared to a cluster of size N-1, where N is even.</p></div><p>This helps visualize that a cluster of size 4 has the same failure tolerance as a cluster size of 3. Increasing the number of nodes will also result in an increase in network utilization, as the leader must send all log entries to every node. So, in the case of choosing an etcd cluster with 3 vs 4 nodes, 3 nodes will give you the same failure tolerance with less network utilization.</p><p>Now that we understand how etcd maintains high availability and consistency, let's discuss how data is actually stored in the system.</p><h3>BoltDB</h3><p>etcd's datastore is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltDB</a>, or more specifically, <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBoltDB</a>, a fork of BoltDB maintained by the etcd contributors.</p><p>Bolt is a Go key-value store which writes its data to a single memory-mapped file. This means that the underlying operating system is responsible for handling how the data is cached, typically caching as much of the file in memory as possible. Thus, Bolt shows high memory usage when working with large datasets. However, assuming that the relevant page is in the cache, this method allows for fast reads.</p><p>Bolt's underlying data structure is a B+ tree consisting of 4KB pages that are allocated as needed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B+ tree</a> structure helps with quick reads and sequential writes. However, Bolt does not perform as well on random writes, since the writes might be made to different pages on disk.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/0b9d9a6c879fc3a79ef726a9a37019e8/bplustree.svg"><figcaption>Bolt stores its data in a B+ tree, a structure that helps with quick reads and sequential writes. Highlighted in green is the path taken to find the data with 4 as the key.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bolt operations are copy-on-write. When a page is updated, it is copied to a completely new page. The old page is added to a "freelist", which Bolt refers to when it needs a new page. This means that deleting large amounts of data will not actually free up space on disk, as the pages are instead kept on Bolt's freelist for future use. In order to free up this space to disk, you will need to perform a defrag, which we'll discuss later in this post.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/fb222f0306d31ddb48305545eb1d5b07/freelist.png"><figcaption>When data is deleted from Bolt, unused pages are not released back to disk, but kept in Bolt’s freelist for future use.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>etcd's Data Model</h3><p>etcd uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersion Concurrency Control</a> in order to safely handle concurrent operations. This goes hand-in-hand with the Raft protocol, as each version in MVCC corresponds to an index in the Raft log. To handle MVCC, etcd tracks changes by revisions. Each transaction made to etcd is a new revision. For example, if you were to load up a fresh instance of etcd and ran the following operations, the revision state would look like so:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By keeping a history of the revisions, etcd is able to provide the version history for specific keys. In the example above, you would just need to read Revisions 4 and 2 in order to see that the current value of <code>foo</code> is <code>updatedBar</code>, and the previous value was <code>bar</code>.</p><p>This means that keys must be associated with their revision numbers, along with their new values. To do so, etcd stores each operation in Bolt as the following key-value pairs:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Here, <code>rev</code> is the revision, <code>sub</code> is a number used to differentiate keys within a single revision (for example, multiple PUTs in a transaction), and <code>type</code> is an optional suffix, usually used for tombstoning. </p><p>For example, if you ran <code>put foo hello</code> following the above example, the corresponding Bolt entry might look like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By writing the keys in this scheme, etcd is able to make all writes sequential, circumventing Bolt's weakness to random writes.</p><p>However, this makes reading keys a little more difficult. For example, to find the current value of <code>foo</code>, you would have to read each entry starting from the latest revision, until finding the revision containing the value for <code>foo</code>. </p><h3>etcd's Key Index</h3><p>To address the key reading problem described above, etcd builds an in-memory <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/recitations/rec25-B-trees/rec25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-tree</a> index which maps each key to its related revisions.</p><p>The actual keys and values of this tree are a little more complex, but the information it provides can most simply be reduced to:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/db2005cf0e02132e8bddab05f5d4c246/b-tree.svg"><figcaption>A simplified example of etcd’s key index, which maps the keys to their revisions. Highlighted is the path taken to find 'foo3' in the tree.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This index says that <code>foo</code> was updated in revision 4, sub 0, and revision 2, sub 0. <code>foo1</code> was updated in revision 3, sub 0, and so on. Using this information, you can easily find the current value of <code>foo</code>, along with its previous values, in Bolt.</p><p>etcd also supports range reads: "get me the values for <code>foo1</code> to <code>foo3</code>" or "find me all keys and values prefixed with <code>foo</code>". Although these keys are logically sequential, they are not stored in Bolt as so. Performing the range read will require using the key index to find the keys that fall within the range, and then finding their associated revisions in Bolt. Given that these keys could have been written at any revision, these would essentially be random reads on Bolt. Efficiency for this operation heavily relies on the hope that most of Bolt's file is in the cache. If your datastore is large, chances are that the relevant pages will need to be read from disk. <b><u>If you have a large dataset, run etcd with SSDs, as they are much faster than spinning disk.</u></b></p><p>If anything, <b><u>range reads will be slightly more efficient if you tend to read and write the same pieces of information together.</u></b> For example, if you …</p></div></div></div></div>

		<div>

			
<h4>Less than half a decade ago, if you had walked up to someone in the industry and said that in 5 years’ time AMD would have the fastest CPUs, you would have been laughed straight out of the room—but here we are. <p>At the time of writing, AMD <em>does</em> have the fastest CPUs on the market with Zen 3, so let’s see where AMD is heading in the future.</p></h4>



<h2>The Ugly Past</h2>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement for me to say that the Bulldozer family of CPUs was a failure. Not just a commercial failure in a period that eventually saw AMD nearing bankruptcy, but also a technical failure. There are however parts of the Bulldozer core that are good such as the FPU and branch predictor unit. Weaknesses in its shared front-end and poor cache/memory systems meant a 4-module Bulldozer CPU lost to a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU in most workloads, despite the higher clocks. Insult to injury for AMD was the the fact that a 4-module Bulldozer CPU also consumed more power than a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU while being slower—in short the architecture was almost universally panned.</p>



<div><p>However, the failure of Bulldozer was not all because of poor CPU design. A lot of Bulldozer’s failures can be traced to its underperforming 32nm node from what was AMD at the time, before its fabs were spun off into Global Foundries. Broadly, the original design goals for Bulldozer were 33% clock speed lift over Phenom on the same 45nm node with no IPC decrease and a release date in 2009. As history shows, this did not happen and so nearly two years later in October 2011, Bulldozer became the product we all know it as: late, hot and slow. </p><p>Thankfully for AMD, when the original Zen architecture released in Q1 2017 it finally showed they weren’t out of the CPU game. Zen 1 had an extremely bullish <strong>40% IPC </strong>increase design goal over Excavator and ultimately delivered an <strong>unheard of 52%</strong> <strong>IPC gain</strong>. AMD was back. Following up with Zen 2 and Zen 3, though they were not the same monstrous uplifts as Zen 1, they represented a respectful 15% and 19% IPC gain over their predecessors respectively. But y’all know that already, so let’s talk about the future of AMD’s CPUs.</p></div>



<h2>A Bright Future</h2>



<p>AMD looks poised for even more continued success with Ryzen, assuming of course that the information and sources that both I and the rest of Chips and Cheese’s staff have access to are accurate. Please take all the following information in this section with the usual cautionary dose of salt. While both the Chips and Cheese team and I have full belief that this information is accurate, that does not mean that this is 100% confirmed and you should not take this as unsalable truth. With this disclaimer out of the way, on to the juicy bits: Zen 3+, Zen 4 and even Zen 5.</p>



<h3>AM5 &amp; DDR5 – New IOD and Future Nodes</h3>



<p>Zen 3+ looks to be a small IPC gain on base Zen 3, having been told “It’s more than Zen+ was [over Zen 1] but not much” which I interpret to mean around a 4 to 7% IPC gain along with customary clock gains moving to the smaller N6 node from TSMC. N6 is a variant of N7 using 5 layers of EUV and is not a true “new node”, more of a refinement. However, the most interesting thing to me is that Zen 3+ on desktop may be the first AM5 CPU. I was told that the IO die for Zen 3+ desktop is using “Not quite [the same] IOD as Zen 4 but uses Zen 4 IP” which I take to mean that it will be using DDR5 and it will be on the same node as Zen 4’s IOD. That’s all I have on Zen 3+, so now on to Zen 4.</p>



<p>Zen 4 is what a lot of people are waiting for, and, if the info I have is accurate, that wait will prove to be even more worth it. It is important to note that the one common thread in all Zen 4 chatter I have heard is resounding positivity. From IPC gains over 25%, a total performance gain of 40%, and even possibly (finally) 5GHz all-core thanks to the new (full node) N5 fabrication at TSMC! Now, I can’t say what is true and what is an over-exaggeration, however I was told from a trusted source that a <strong>Genoa</strong> engineering sample (Zen 4 server chip) was <strong>29% faster</strong> than a Milan (Zen 3) chip with the same core config at <strong>the</strong> <strong>same clocks</strong>. Factor this in with what I have heard about the possible clock gains that N5 will enable over N7 and Zen 4 sounds like it is going to be a <strong>monster</strong> of a CPU.</p>



<p>Now I said I had Zen 5 info, unfortunately this comes from a different, less-proven source than my Zen 4 info, however they have said that the jump [to Zen 5 from 4] from will be about as much as <strong>Piledriver to Zen 1 design goal, which if you recall to earlier in this article was 40%</strong>. I was told from a 3rd source that Zen 5’s original design goal was 2.5 to 3 times the IPC of Zen 1 which roughly lines up with the perspective of a “Piledriver to Zen 1”-like jump.</p>



<h2>Looking Forward… AMD’s Problem is Success</h2>



<p>If this info is all true, then that puts AMD in a very good position from a performance standpoint. However, the biggest problem for AMD of late hasn’t been one of performance but of wafer supply. With Apple moving off of Intel CPUs and onto their own silicon for (gradually) their entire lineup, the supply of N5 wafers from TSMC for AMD will be less than if Apple had stuck with Intel. Being that AMD is always 2nd in line for new nodes at TSMC behind Apple, this may be a cause for concern moving forward. </p>



<h3>Bright Spot: Consoles Out of the Picture with TSMC N5</h3>



<div><p>However, perhaps an even bigger factor for availability on TSMC N5 will be that neither future AMD CPUs nor GPUs will need to compete with console chips as they will remain on N7. Couple this with the rumors that AMD GPUs are also going MCM with RDNA3, and it is possible that Zen 5 and RDNA 3 supply will be better than what we know of the current shortages for Zen 3. This is especially important for the GPU side seeing the current availability issues around RDNA2; the wafer allocation of which has been said to represent low-single digits of TSMC’s N7 supply.  This is all of course, wishful thinking. At this point in time, who knows.</p><p>One thing is certain however: AMD’s future looks bright.</p></div>



<h2>Author’s Note (2/8/21)</h2>



<p>There was a miscommunication between myself and the editor with regards to the performance claims of Zen 4. The only thing that we are claiming with any level of certainty is the claim of a Genoa ES sample being 29% faster then Milan at the same clocks.</p>



<p>We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.</p>

<![CDATA[A Poetic Apology: Or Why Should You Use Poetry to Manage Python Dependencies]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>If you ever spent some time trying to write a Python application you have probably
experienced Python’s Infamous Dependency Hell at some point. You’ve probably also
gathered by now that it has become a folk tradition to start any piece about such subject
with the following notorious <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">xkcd comic</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://muttdata.ai/blog/img/posts/poetry_apology/xkcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily for you (and all of us) at the time of writing, there are some good solutions to
the entanglement of pains brilliantly depicted in the image above. In fact, you most likely
already know that if you want to develop against multiple Python versions you can readily
use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to start unraveling your twisted environment.
You might have also learned that if you happen to be working at the same time on multiple
projects with conflicting dependencies then you can employ <em>virtual environments</em> to
isolate clashing libraries. In this document, we’ll introduce yet another tool,
<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>, and make an argument about why you
should probably add it to your own toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine one lonely night you decide to start a simple dummy Python project accurately
named <code>foo</code> with the following structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code>├── foo
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── bar
│   │   │   └── data.py
│   │   └── constants.py
│   └── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this is not your first Python project and you want to avoid spending more endless
nights fixing incompatibilities between your system and project modules, you diligently
initiate a virtual environment from your shell with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and activate it within the newly created project with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Equipped with an isolated environment, you triumphantly proceed to install the ubiquitous
Pandas data library. To achieve such thing you use Python’s de-facto package manager
<code>pip</code> and carefully pin the library version to ensure replicability</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>0.25.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since you are a bit lazy at doing exploratory data analysis, you also install the nifty
<code>pandas-profiling</code> module to help you with that tedious work</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span>pandas-profiling<span>==</span>2.5.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After all this flirting, you finally start coding (assuming that adding the
following lines to the <code>data.py</code> file can, in fact, be called that)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pandas_profiling</span> <span>import</span> <span>ProfileReport</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>([[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>],[</span><span>'b'</span><span>,</span><span>None</span><span>]],</span><span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'value'</span><span>])</span>
<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>]</span><span>=</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>].</span><span>astype</span><span>(</span><span>'category'</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span><span>==</span><span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span><span>ProfileReport</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>).</span><span>to_file</span><span>(</span><span>'foo.html'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given that your days of abusing <code>print</code> statements for debugging purposes are long gone,
you install the beautiful and handy <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp">pdbpp</a> library to
check that these lines work as intended</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pdbpp</span><span>==</span>0.10.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and run your code in <em>post mortem debugging mode</em> with <code>python -m pdb -cc data.py</code>.</p>

<p>Happy with the clean run, you now realize that in order to ship your voluptuous application
without falling into the “works on my machine” trap you need a way to collect all your
dependencies. A quick Google search will show you that pip’s <code>freeze</code> subcommand allows to
record the current environment package into a <code>requirements.txt</code> file by means of the
following incantation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which lets anyone use your project by simply installing the needed dependencies with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as you are about to reveal your masterpiece project to the world, you become aware
that the improved debugging module is actually only used by you while developing. With the
idea of splitting the frozen requirements into separate production and development files,
you take a peek into the generated file only to discover that each and every
single sub-dependency of your application’s dependencies is listed therein and locked to a
specific version. Foreseeing the nightmare of maintaining this immense list you uninstall
the <code>pdbpp</code> library to ensure a clean requirements file again by means of</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip uninstall <span>-y</span> pdbpp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick glance at the modified requirements file, however, shows that things didn’t quite
turn out as expected: <code>pdbpp</code> was indeed removed but its dependencies, such as
<code>fancycompleter</code>, are still installed. Since this seems a dead-end, you choose to start
from scratch by manually creating a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with only production
dependencies</p>

<pre><code>pandas==0.25.3
pandas-profiling==2.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>and an equivalent development file, <code>requirements_dev.txt</code>, solely containing</p>

<pre><code>pdbpp==0.10.2
</code></pre>

<p>Impressed by the cleverness that has seemingly helped you dodge the dreaded Python
dependency hell by keeping a record of isolated top-level packages, you decide to call it a
day and give a final spin to your application the next day.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, the news are all over the place: Pandas v1 is
finally out (after only twelve years!). A couple of hours procrastinating with the
incredibly long changelog makes you conclude that your complex foo-project
will surely gain notable improvements by updating to the brand new version. Now since
you’ve locked Pandas to an exact version, you cannot simply run</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead you must execute</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>1.0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which leads to a particularly bizarre and confusing situation: an error pops in your
terminal</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: pandas-profiling 2.5.0 has requirement pandas==0.25.3, but you'll have pandas 1.0.0 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>

<p>but the installation of <code>pandas 1.0.0</code> nonetheless takes place. Assuming this to be a warning
that <code>pip</code> mistakes for an error, you update your <code>requirements.txt</code> file accordingly and
joyfully proceed to run your <code>data.py</code> module one last time, only to discover that it throws
an enigmatic <code>TypeError</code>. Feeling now betrayed by pip’s apparent inability to resolve
dependencies, you rollback your changes and stick with Pandas’ (now) outdated version.</p>

<p>At this point, you seem to have a working project but i) you are unsure whether reverting
Pandas version might have broken the desired replicability of your application, ii) the
code could definitely look better and iii) after a good night’s sleep you acknowledge that
the overall functionality of your application is not as complex and rich as you thought it
was the night before. To address the first two issues, you first add the <code>black</code> formatter
to your <code>requirements_dev.txt</code></p>

<pre><code>black==19.10b0
</code></pre>

<p>and then within your project directory, you recreate your virtual environment with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>rm</span> <span>-rf</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements_dev.txt
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you run <code>black</code> in your project root (with <code>black .</code>) and are mostly satisfied with
the prettifying job it did but to abide by Mutt Data’s format style (which is coincidentally
consistent with your dislike of making every single quote a double quote), you add a
<code>pyproject.toml</code> telling <code>black</code> to skip such appalling string normalization default
setting</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[tool.black]</span>
<span>skip-string-normalization</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code looks great now and a new post mortem debugging run shows that things seem to work
fine in the new (replicable) environment. The only thing left to be done before deploying
the code on the server or sharing it with the world is to avoid having constants, such as
the report name, hardcoded all around the code. You thus
decide to add the following lines to your <code>constants.py</code> empty module</p>



<p>and modify the <code>data.py</code> to import such constant from the relative parent file with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>..constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new <code>data.py</code> run however now, unfortunately, shows the next error</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre>

<p>which according to the omniscient SO makes sense since Python relative imports only work
within a package and therefore if you want to import from a parent directory you should
either create such package or hack the <code>sys.path</code>. As a true purist pythonista, you pick
the former path and create a <code>setup.py</code> with the following contents</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>setuptools</span> <span>import</span> <span>setup</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>install_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements_dev.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>extras_dev_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>

<span>setup</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.1'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author</span><span>=</span><span>'Mutt'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author_email</span><span>=</span><span>'info@muttdata.ai'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>install_requires</span><span>=</span><span>install_requires</span><span>,</span>
    <span>extras_require</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'dev'</span><span>:</span> <span>extras_dev_requires</span><span>},</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'foo'</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in a brand new virtual env you install your package in editable mode with <code>pip install
-e .[dev]</code>, change the import line in <code>data.py</code> to account for the package structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>foo.constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and cross your fingers hoping everything finally works…</p>

<p>Everything does indeed (brittlely) work, but somehow all the hoop-jumping to make it
function makes you uneasy. A brief introspection reveals several reasons for the wave of
apprehension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since you plan to work on multiples Python projects at the same time, isolation is a
fundamental piece of your workflow. Virtual environments do solve this problem, but
the activate/deactivate process is cumbersome and easy to forget.</li>
  <li>Having dependencies isolated between projects doesn’t address dependency clash within a
project. Proper dependency resolution is the top required feature of any package
manager worthy of respect yet <code>pip</code> will only get such feature by October 2020.
Manually guaranteeing dependency consistency in complex projects is a deadlock.</li>
  <li>If you want to install your application/project as a package, you must go through the
overhead of adding a <code>setup.py</code> on top of your already multiple requirements files.
However, you’ve read PEPs 517-518 and want to try out the simpler and safer build
mechanisms mentioned therein.</li>
  <li>You thought about trying your application on a different machine, but realized it ran
Python 3.7 while your local box runs 3.8. To use <code>pyenv</code> with your isolated virtual
envs, you need an extra plugin,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>, which makes managing
venvs even more burdensome.</li>
  <li>You briefly played with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a> which promised to
bring …</li></ol></div></div></div>

Shopify has its own portion of false retailers and fraudulent activity. Here is how to stay safe when using Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecommerce platforms made it possible for small businesses to have a wider market and reach customers beyond their location and borders through their online stores. At the same time, it made it possible for shoppers to find all sorts of new products with well-organized dropshipping and ease of use that the Shopify platform, eBay, Amazon, and other ecommerce websites offer.</p>
<p>But there are two signs to every coin. The bad news is that store owners and shoppers canâ€™t always escape fraudsters on these platforms. The good news is that <strong>e-commerce platforms have thorough vetting systems and a vast community that shares reviews</strong>, so itâ€™s easy to know the schemes and patterns of ecommerce stores that scam people.</p>
<p>In this article, weâ€™ll focus mainly on Shopify scams. To learn more about the platformâ€™s ins and outs, check out this guide on <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/wix-vs-shopify">Shopify vs Wix</a>, as well as this <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/shopify-payments">detailed article on Shopify Payments</a>. Now, letâ€™s dig in into Shopify Store scams.</p>
</div><div id="types-of-scams-on-shopify"><h2>Types of scams on Shopify</h2>
<p>In the last year, Shopify <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/shopify-positions-itself-as-the-coronavirus-and-beyond-platform/">became the most popular ecommerce platform</a> for both shoppers and retailers to keep their business afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. It unveiled many features and updates to help users have a better experience, from <strong>better algorithms</strong> to a <strong>longer trial period</strong> and <strong>know how resources for new users</strong>. Naturally, this also seemed to attract more fraudsters.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more efficient schemes you should know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/tsrsH8jBRLQSSo2z0Syw" alt="la20.48 infographic.png"></p>
<h3>Triangulation scheme</h3>
<p>One of the smartest and most enduring schemes on Shopify and other ecommerce platforms is the so-called triangulation scheme.</p>
<p>Basically, fraudsters create an active Shopify store and market themselves as selling proper products. They then <strong>buy products from online suppliers, acting as the middleman</strong> in shipping the merchandise to the shoppersâ€™ addresses (which is exactly how dropshipping works).</p>
<p>But, hereâ€™s the catch: they buy the merchandise from the suppliers with previously stolen cards. The credit card company will <strong>reject the transaction and initiate a chargeback on Shopify</strong>. When a chargeback occurs, <strong>Shopify doesnâ€™t return the money to the seller, hence they lose both the product and the money</strong>.</p>
<p>The triangulation scheme was especially on the rise in 2016 when the Pokemon Go game came out. Lots of fake stores claimed to sell this game and managed to scam a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Shopify Store duplicator scheme</h3>
<p>The duplicator scheme is so simple, yet itâ€™s hard to believe people can pull it off. Basically, scammers find recently created Shopify Stores and <strong>create one with a similar domain name, claiming to sell the same original product</strong>. All sorts of products have been â€œmirroredâ€� on similar web addresses, from original merchandise t-shirts to branded teabags.</p>
<p>The most famous example of this scheme is when scammers created a duplicate store to Mike Lindellâ€™s MyPillow store with a domain name mypillow.com. In 2018, the merchant noticed a twin storefront to his, registered under the domain name mypillowstore.com. Lindell sued Shopify for failing to spot the scamming sites and bigcommerce trademark infringement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shopify took down the fake storefront and added more software tools that cost $30 and up and offer monthly maintenance for merchantsâ€™ transactions. They also have more tech teams dedicated to combing out the fake Shopify sites.</p>
<h3>Switching scheme</h3>
<p>This is one of the more serious schemes since it causes a long-term loss with sellers. It has been prevalent in e-commerce platforms such as eBay before. Basically, what happens is that <strong>a potential buyer will make a purchase on your Shopify store and request a direct invoice from you straight from PayPal</strong>. As a reason for this, they will say they have difficulty and canâ€™t finish a payment because of technical issues on the platform.</p>
<p>After you send them an invoice, <strong>you will get a notification that is allegedly from PayPal</strong>, but actually fake, <strong>that the buyer has paid and is waiting for the product tracking number</strong>. Until you give them the tracking number, <strong>â€œPayPalâ€� checkout has the funds on hold</strong>. Naturally, if a seller falls for the trick, the scammer will get the products for free, since there is no PayPal holding the funds. If weâ€™re talking about a big shipment or a very expensive product, as a seller, you could lose a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Direct Client scheme</h3>
<p>This scam takes some sweet-talking scammers. Basically, a buyer makes a purchase that goes well, and the products are at the right shipping address on time. Then, when <strong>the seller gains the buyerâ€™s trust</strong>, they make a suggestion that next time they should skip the whole hassle and extra costs on Shopify, and <strong>go straight to a direct card payment technique</strong>. Of course, then they have the credit card digits and data, so they can exhaust the buyerâ€™s fund. The buyer, needless to say, doesnâ€™t get the goods this time.</p>
<h3>Fake return ticket</h3>
<p>Yet another slow-burning, but effective method of scamming is the counterfeited return ticket fraud. In this scenario, a buyer purchases goods once. Then they decide to purchase a <strong>similar, but a slightly cheaper product</strong>. <strong>They request a return on the first purchase</strong>, citing the product that was received looks different from the pictures or there is something wrong with it. Then, <strong>they return the second, similar but cheaper product</strong>, which enables them to get the money for the first product back and also keep the good and more expensive product.</p>
<h3>Fake Purchase order</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>scam that requires the most technical knowledge and software skills</strong> to be performed. So itâ€™s rarer but extremely effective, and youâ€™d still need to be wary.  Basically, a scammer that is in the position of a customer will <strong>create a copy of the sellerâ€™s Shopify checkout sheet</strong> in their drive <strong>and alter the submit button link</strong>. Then, they will patch it to their  PHP software or program that enables saving all data saved from your checkout. Afterward, they will modify the data they received and adjust it to send the fake checkout sheet back, at a lower price. You wonâ€™t notice the difference in price without knowing itâ€™s doctored, and approve the transaction.</p>
<p>This scam allows the fraudsters to <strong>get products without the sellerâ€™s consent or with it but for a smaller price</strong>, and before the seller realizes that something is going on they can lose a whole shipmentâ€™s worth of money.</p>
<p>If they donâ€™t successfully doctor the purchase sheet, they have a good plan B: asking for a chargeback, which will still make the seller lose money.</p>
</div><div id="how-to-report-scams"><h2>How to report scams</h2>
<p>As a customer, you can report fraudulent activity or bad experience with a merchant here. The list covers many situations, <strong>from non-delivery of a sold item to restricted items and illegal activity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/hEpxaGdTRRmNYcmAehnn" alt="report an issue shopify.png"></p>
<p>However, if youâ€™re on the other side of the selling process and being scammed by a customer, apart from having a premium Shopify web store with all maintenance services, itâ€™s mostly up to you to stay careful.</p>
<p>Choosing a secure payment gateway and having a single place for all your transactions with Shopify payments is helpful.</p>
<p>Also, itâ€™s safe to save proof of your transactions, by making screenshots of your communication and transactions that you can later use to prove your case when reporting scams.</p>
<p>Lastly, itâ€™s fair to mention that <strong>Shopify</strong>, no matter the many measures they take with battling scammers, <strong>is still swarming with fraudulent activity</strong>. You can check out the <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Reporting-a-scam-store/td-p/644505">discussion board</a> for more info on other possible scams and ways to battle it.</p>

It’s a self-contained web application that facilitates labeling and exploration of your data, and can even be extended for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)" rel="noopener nofollow">Active Learning</a> or <a href="https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Online Learning</a>.</p><p id="89fe">All you need to get started labeling and annotating your data is to set up a project in Label Studio.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg" width="540" height="614" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 540w" sizes="540px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/52/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Pachyderm overview (Source: Pachyderm)</figcaption></figure><p id="01e1">Pachyderm is a data science and processing platform with built-in versioning and lineage. It gives you an immutable, copy-on-write file system that fronts on object stores like S3, which allows you to keep all changes to your data as they happen. It also keeps track of the journey of that data, recording a git-style commit with each transformation that allows you to roll out and roll back every single step of your data transformation from beginning to end.</p><p id="9293">What makes Pachyderm unique among all other ML platforms is that immutable file layer. It keeps every single change to your data. Other versioning systems are limited because they don’t enforce immutability, which can easily leave you in a bad state when your underlying data changes. Imagine you overwrote a bunch of your labeled images with new labels and didn’t save the originals. Now every single experiment that points to the original set of files can no longer be recreated. The commits point to a state that doesn’t exist. Pachyderm keeps every change and that means you can always roll back in time if you find an earlier version of your files was the one you really need to train your production model right.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3742/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg" width="1871" height="883" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Diagram of the label studio integration. Label Studio is using Pachyderm’s S3 gateway as the source and target locations for raw and labeled data respectively. (Source: Image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="9561">Combining these two platforms is straightforward. We use Label Studio to interact with data that gets stored and versioned in Pachyderm. Pachyderm handles changes submitted to it from Label Studio, versioning them and running pipelines to kick off new training iterations in your machine learning loop.</p><p id="88bd"><strong>Label Studio</strong>’s<a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-070-cloud-storage-enablement.html" rel="noopener nofollow"> cloud storage interoperability</a> means that Label Studio can read data from and write labeled data to cloud storage. We can configure Label Studio to read source data from an Amazon S3 bucket, automatically pulling in new data to be labeled whenever it’s added to the bucket. We can also write our annotated data to a “target” S3 bucket, still retaining a reference to the original data.</p><p id="3d93"><strong>Pachyderm</strong> does many powerful things to manage and version data, while also providing a clean <a href="https://pachdm.com/2N35a0q" rel="noopener nofollow">S3 gateway</a>. This means we can treat Pachyderm as a cloud storage system. When we put files into Pachyderm’s “buckets” (versioned data repositories), we are actually committing files to be versioned. Versioned files ensure that if we delete or change a file in Pachyderm, the new state of the bucket reflects the change, while the old file still exists in a previous commit that can always be recovered.</p><p id="152d">Label Studio continually pulls new data from its source bucket, so whenever we commit data to our source repository in Pachyderm, Label Studio imports it as tasks to be labeled. After a task is completed (labeled), Label Studio writes the completion to our target bucket location, which commits the completion file to the target data repository.</p><p id="f83c">Later, If we decide to change a task’s label, Label Studio modifies the existing completion file. Pachyderm treats this change as a new commit to our labeled data repository, giving us a record of any changes that were made.</p><p id="9461">In a more mature use case, we would also use Pachyderm’s repository branches, so we can iterate on our data in a development branch without impacting pipelines that may depend on the master branch of our labeled data. This serves a highly useful purpose, allowing us to test a new version of our dataset before releasing/promoting it as the master version.</p><h2 id="3fbc">Run It Yourself</h2><p id="cfef">Find a full example of Label Studio configurations for Pachyderm in this <a href="https://pachdm.com/36U10iG" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repo</a>. The example configurations show you how to incorporate Label Studio for labeling text data for a sentiment classification task, but can easily be extended and configured for any labeling project. You can also add Pachyderm pipelines for pre-processing or even to <a href="https://pachdm.com/3jtyQ2M" rel="noopener nofollow">automate data ingestion</a>. The general setup requires:</p><p id="3b1d">1. Give Label Studio access to Pachyderm. Generate a Pachyderm security token (not necessary if running locally), configure the S3 gateway endpoint, and create an <a href="https://pachdm.com/3p1Aaey" rel="noopener nofollow">environment file</a> with the configuration. A sample .env file is shown below:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Example .env file for configuring the Endpoint URL.</figcaption></figure><p id="58b8">2. Edit the source and target buckets in the Label Studio configuration to point to the Pachyderm versioned data repositories. The bucket names follow the convention <code>&lt;repo_branch&gt;.&lt;data_repo&gt;/&lt;file_name&gt;</code> . An example configuration is shown below.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Label Studio config with Pachyderm’s S3 backend.</figcaption></figure><p id="86d6">Data labeling and data versioning provide a rock solid bedrock to build your machine learning models on now and in the future. On their own, versioning and labeling are useful but when you bring them together, Label Studio and Pachyderm can dramatically increase the efficiency and dependability of the labeling cycle in your machine learning loop. That means better models, faster and more reliably and that’s what every data science team on the planet is pushing towards. The stronger their foundation, the more they can focus on making their models better rather than wrangling data.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>From the Linux kernel to Firefox and Wordpress, Open Source is changing the world for the better. But how to achieve financial sustainability when you produce something that can legally be copied, by design, at zero cost?</p>
<h2 id="revenue-models-for-open-source">Revenue models for Open Source</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23218943">lot</a> has been written about <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">achieving profitability</a> for open source projects, still it’s not a solved problem. Here are the most common ways for open source projects to generate profit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting: where you offer a fully-managed version of your project. It’s certainly the easiest way to scale revenues but it’s not appropriate for all products.</li>
<li>Paying support: popularized by Red Hat and other Linux distributions, this model is hard to scale and create bizarre incentives.</li>
<li>Patronage: patrons are helping artists make a living since forever. Unfortunately as you are depending on the goodwill of your patrons, it’s an extremely precarious way of life without a huge audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VC</a>: According to my empirical study it’s extremely hard to create a long term business whose interests are aligned with those of its users going this way.</li>
<li>Having a real job™ beside: but is your project worth sacrificing all your free time for it?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bloom">Bloom</h2>
<p>Early in 2019, I innocently started working on <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom">Bloom</a> with one mission: putting an end to digital feudalism (Why? How? What? 👉 <a href="https://kerkour.com/blog/bloom-a-free-and-open-source-google">You can read the launch post here</a>).
The idea resonated with a lot of people and I received more positive feedback than I would ever have imagined.</p>
<p>But the path to success was still not clear: I launched the project as a self-hostable web application with a plan to create native applications with end-to-end encryption later. It quickly turned into a full-time R&amp;D project as end-to-end encryption is not yet a totally solved problem (especially its key distribution part) and neither is native applications distribution (App stores being controlled by two companies that are more and more user hostile).</p>

<p>So, how to survive the valley of death and stay alive enough time to reach product-market fit and turn Bloom into a sustainable open source project?</p>
<h2 id="black-hat-rust">Black Hat Rust</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skerkour">
    <img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/github_contributions.png">
</a></p><p>While developing Bloom, I have written and deleted a hundred thousand lines of code of Rust, if not more. From achieving great development speed to designing and implementing an en-to-end encrypted synchronization protocol, passing by handling millions of HTTP requests a day, I’ve learned a few things along the way. <br>
Why not turn these thousand hours of experience into a profit which will allow me to arrange free hours during the week to work on Bloom? <br>
Some friends suggested that I launch an Udemy course, but I was not a fan of the idea because I find the ratio of information / time of these video courses too low compared to a good old book.</p>
<p>So I decided to write a book about Rust. As I had experience with offensive security (developing an automated vulnerability scanner, reverse engineering applications and helping plenty of companies to secure their assets) I narrowed the scope of the book to offensive security programming with Rust. <br>
Rust is not only a great fit for offensive programming, but the only one-size-fits-all programming language able to meet all the needs of this field: from shellcodes and exploits to servers, RATs and phishing pages in WebAssembly, Rust is polyvalent enough to shine in all those tasks. <br>
<em>Black Hat Rust - Deep dive into offensive security with the Rust programming language</em> was born!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lcow5j/black_hat_rust_im_writing_a_book_about_offensive">I announced the (extremely) early-access edition of the book on Reddit</a> last week and received a lot of positive feedback. <br>
Idea validated. Funding secured. 🥳 <br>
Even if the hardest part is yet to come, I just want to say a big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the people who are making this possible. <br>
Since this Monday I have started to work 4 days a week on the book and 2 days on Bloom (yes, as an indie hacker my workweek is 6 days long 🤷‍♂️).</p>
<p>If you find the idea compelling and want to be part of the adventure, here is a coupon to save 10€ on the book: <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG</a>.</p>

        <p>A company that will remain nameless (unless someone convinces me otherwise) recently sent me this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks so much for agreeing to your virtual on-site interview for a position in the &lt;redacted&gt;!</p>

  <p>Beforehand, please take a look at the comments below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your presentation is expected to be in front of a fairly diverse audience.  Members of the interview panel are going to be there, and members from other functions, such as marketing, may attend as well.  Prepare with this in mind.</li>
    <li>For your presentation, you may want to begin with a brief introduction of who you are and where you have been in your career.  Consider giving the audience a sense of who you are and what has motivated you in your career development.</li>
    <li>From previous experiences, there will likely be questions and interruptions during your presentation.  Some questions may be general, and some may be specific and technical.  Manage your time wisely.</li>
    <li>Choose 1-2 projects that you have worked on in-depth and personally; you would know these projects well and be excited to talk about them.  Convey your excitement to the audience.  Talk about recent (rather than old) projects if possible.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to go into details on the projects you will present.  Do give a high-level overview of the project (e.g., What is the problem?  Why is it important?) . Do go into some level of technical specifics.  What have you done?  How have you done it?</li>
    <li>Give the audience a sense of <em>how</em> you think.  What were the factors you considered when you approached the problem?  What were the challenges?  How did you overcome them?  Provide specific examples whenever possible.</li>
    <li>You may present your slide deck directly from your laptop or send me a copy and I will flip thru the deck for you during the presentation.  It is your choice.</li>
    <li>Please install Zoom and Microsoft Teams on your laptop prior to the seminar.  We will use Microsoft Teams as default and Zoom as backup.
We greatly look forward to meeting you!</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They wanted me to make a hour long presentation as part of the interview.
The last time I made a talk that long, I practiced it for weeks.
Given that they gave me a week’s heads-up total, I took the weekend and put together what I could.
I’d say I put in a dozen hours, realistically.
I was pretty excited about the final product and was kinda looking forward to giving the talk.
The day before my interview, I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good Morning Jessime,</p>

  <p>I must inform you, that your Zoom Interview for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 10th got canceled.  Our recruiter will give you a call for more information.
Have a great day and stay safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recruiter called me and we talked briefly.
They said that I interviewed extremely well, but that they decided to go with another candidate.
That’s fair, I suppose.
They were looking for someone with a few years of experience working with a specific technology I had never used.
But… they knew that from my resume.</p>

<p>And from my first interview.</p>

<p>And from my second interview.</p>

<p>And when they told me that I needed to prep a talk.</p>

<p>The recruiter told me, “Don’t be shy about reapplying for another position.”
Thank you, but I’m probably good.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to share my presentation somewhere, so I guess I’ll share it here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

					<p>Your brain has been altered, neurologically re-wired as you acquired a particular skill. This renovation has left you with a specialized area in your left ventral occipital temporal region, shifted facial recognition into your right hemisphere, reduced your inclination toward holistic visual processing, increased your verbal memory, and thickened your corpus callosum, which is the information highway that connects the left and right hemispheres of your brain.</p>
<p>What accounts for these neurological and psychological changes?</p>
<p>You are likely highly literate. As you learned to read, probably as a child, your brain reorganized itself to better accommodate your efforts, which had both functional and inadvertent consequences for your mind.</p>
<p>So, to account for these changes to your brain—e.g, your thicker corpus callosum and poorer facial recognition—we need to ask when and why did parents, communities, and governments come to see it as necessary for everyone to learn to read. Here, a puzzle about neuroscience and cognition turns into a historical question.</p>
<p>Of course, writing systems are thousands of years old, found in ancient Sumer, China, and Egypt, but in most literate societies only a small fraction of people ever learned to read, rarely more than 10%. So, when did people decide that everyone should learn to read? Maybe it came with the rapid economic growth of the Nineteenth Century? Or, surely, the intelligentsia of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, imbued with reason and rationality, figured it out?</p>
<p>No, it was a religious mutation in the Sixteenth Century<em>. </em>After bubbling up periodically in prior centuries, the belief that every person should read and interpret the Bible for themselves began to rapidly diffuse across Europe with the eruption of the Protestant Reformation, marked in 1517 by Martin Luther’s delivery of his famous ninety-five theses. Protestants came to believe that both boys and girls had to study the Bible for themselves to better know their God. In the wake of the spread of Protestantism, the literacy rates in the newly reforming populations in Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands surged past more cosmopolitan places like Italy and France. Motivated by eternal salvation, parents and leaders made sure the children learned to read.</p>
<p>The sharpest test of this idea comes from work in economics, led by Sascha Becker and Ludger Woessmann. The historical record, including Luther’s own descriptions, suggest that within the German context, Protestantism diffused out from Luther’s base in Wittenberg (Saxony). Using data on literacy and schooling rates in nineteenth-century Prussia, Becker and Woessmann first show that counties with more Protestants (relative to Catholics) had higher rates of both literacy and schooling. So, there’s a correlation. Then, taking advantage of the historical diffusion from Wittenberg, they show that for every 100-km traveled from Wittenberg, the percentage of Protestants in a county dropped by 10%. Then, with a little statistical razzle-dazzle, this patterning allows them to extract the slice of the variation in Protestantism that was, in a sense, caused by the Reformation’s ripples as they spread outward from the epicenter in Wittenberg. Finally, they show that having more Protestants does indeed cause higher rates of literacy and schooling. All-Protestant counties had literacy rates nearly 20 percentage points higher than all-Catholic counties. Subsequent work focusing on the Swiss Reformation, where the epicenters were Zurich and Geneva, reveals strikingly similar patterns.</p>
<p>The Protestant impact on literacy and education can still be observed today in the differential impact of Protestant vs. Catholic missions in Africa and India. In Africa, regions with early Protestant missions at the beginning of the Twentieth Century (now long gone) are associated with literacy rates that are about 16 percentage points higher, on average, than those associated with Catholic missions. In some analyses, Catholics have no impact on literacy at all unless they faced direct competition for souls from Protestant missions. These impacts can also be found in early twentieth-century China.</p>
<p>The Protestant emphasis on Biblical literacy reshaped Catholic practices and inadvertently laid the foundation for modern schooling. Forged in the fires of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuit Order adopted many Protestant practices, including an emphasis on schooling and worldly skills. Analyses of an indigenous population at the junction of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil reveal that the closer a community is to a historical Jesuit mission (which existed from 1609 to 1767), the higher its literacy rate today. By contrast, proximity to one of the Franciscan missions in the same region is unrelated to modern literacy—the Franciscans formed three centuries before the Reformation and hadn’t internalized Protestant values.</p>
<p>The notion of universal, state-funded schooling has its roots in religious ideals. As early as 1524, Martin Luther not only emphasized the need for parents to ensure their children’s literacy but also placed the responsibility for creating schools on secular governments. This religiously inspired drive for public schools helped make Prussia a model for public education, which was later copied by countries like Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>When the Reformation reached Scotland in 1560, John Knox and his fellow reformers called for free public education for the poor and justified this with the need for everyone to acquire the skills to better know God. Having placed the burden for delivering schooling on the government, the world’s first local school tax was established in 1633 CE and strengthened in 1646 CE. This early experiment in universal education may have mid-wifed the Scottish Enlightenment, which produced intellectual luminaries ranging from David Hume to Adam Smith. A century later, the early intellectual dominance of this tiny region inspired France’s Voltaire to write, “we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization.” Voltaire, who grew up in a region controlled by Huguenots (French Calvinists), was educated in Jesuit schools, along with other Enlightenment luminaries like Diderot and Condorcet. Rousseau, for his part, likely learned to read from his Calvinist father in the Protestant city-state of Geneva.</p>
<p>The story of literacy, Luther, and your left ventral occipital temporal region is but one example in a much larger scientific mosaic that is just now coalescing. Our minds, brains, and indeed our biology are, in myriad ways, substantially shaped by the social norms, values, institutions, beliefs, and languages bequeathed to us from prior generations. By setting the incentives and defining the constraints, our culturally-constructed world shape how we think, feel and perceive—they tinker with and calibrate the machinery of our minds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-name="content">
<p><time>February 7, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: Most companies use the wrong metrics during software engineering
interviews. That makes them both brutal for the candidates and inefficient for
the companies. Both sides suffer as a result. In this blog post, we propose how
to improve your hiring loop by using the right metric.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-of-using-the-wrong-metric">The problem of using the wrong metric</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, let’s recap how a typical hiring loop looks and the
rationale behind it. It usually consists of several technical interviews,
followed by “meet the CEO” ones. The technical interviews can take different
forms: from universally loathed on-site whiteboarding to pairing sessions using
online coding solutions. The unifying theme in all those forms is that the
candidate must solve all the puzzles the interviewers could come up with for
the interview and do that under pressure. Ultimately the decision of whether to
extend the offer depends on the candidate not making any technical mistakes.</p>

<p>In other words: can the candidate survive the interview.</p>

<p>The metrics one would get from such interviews are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ability to recall the implementation details of some algorithms or data
structures. A rarely used trait outside of the interview because you can
always look those things up. Some companies are outright recommending “Cracking
The Coding Interview” as a pre-interview practice. Let’s face the facts: how
many times have you referred to that book while working? This ability is not a
good predictor of whether the candidate will generate value. Learning recipes
by heart doesn’t guarantee a good chef. Memorizing traffic laws doesn’t make
you a safe driver. Why do you think remembering programming puzzles will
produce a great software engineer?</p></li>

<li><p>The ability to imagine outcomes. Questions like: what if the app has 10x more
clients? What if memory pressure increases? What interviewers hope to measure
is building or system design skills. Instead, they measure imagination, which
is an entirely different trait. Of course, experienced candidates can share
more war stories of things going wrong. But, unless you test the candidate’s
design with an actual 10x load, all you get is speculation.</p></li>

<li><p>How much the candidate’s thinking process aligns with that of an interviewer.
They ask the same questions to many candidates and expect the usual answers.
If they encounter a unique solution, they have to counteract their confirmation
bias. As a brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question">Barometer</a> legend shows, this spawns further than software
engineers’ interviews. And thus, the candidate’s ability to deliver value
remains unmeasured.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typical hiring loops can generate a sporadic great hire or two, but they are
not consistent in doing so. Like a coin toss, sometimes they yield the opposite
results, and making a bad hire is an expensive mistake. Burned by it, the
company will invest more resources trying to protect itself. The common-sense
approach is to pause and investigate why the hiring loop produced the mistake
in the first place. However, the hiring loop is usually the last to suspect –
after all, it brought the company to its current state, so it must be working,
right? That simple conclusion cloaks the hiring loop from improvement, and it
remains deficient. Instead of implementing the constructive changes, the
company raises the bar to entry. They start using trickier puzzles or asking
the candidates to design more complicated systems, sometimes while still
operating within the time frame of a typical one-hour on-site interview. That
undoubtedly makes interviews more brutal and harsh. Fewer candidates survive
them, and the company sees it as a positive change.</p>

<p>But that neither improves their filtering nor protects them from bad hires.
They get the same data points, again and again, never improving the signal to
noise ratio. If they raise the bar too high, they throw the baby out with the
bathwater as they start to pass on talent. All those metrics from the above
become a single one: can the candidate avoid making mistakes. Errare humanum
est, remember?</p>

<p>If the company does that for too long, then the hiring decisions become
protective and based on fear. Instead of highlighting the value that the
candidate brings to the table, the interviewers will seek a reason to reject
them. If they couldn’t find it, they will resort to biases and personal
inclinations. Training interviewers to reject the candidates will only produce
more efficient rejections.</p>

<blockquote>Tell me how you measure, and I will tell you how I will behave.
<p>Eli Goldratt, The Haystack Syndrome</p></blockquote>

<p>Improper metrics at the core of your hiring loop will make it yield inefficient
results. To fix that, we need to address the root cause and base the loop on a
better set of metrics.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-set-of-questions">A better set of questions</h2>

<p>We have refined three questions that determine a practical hiring decision for
a software engineer:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Can the candidate do the actual work?</li>
    <li>Can we work together?</li>
    <li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>This set is not a silver bullet that will drive your hiring loop from zero to
success. It is neither a secret knowledge nor a magic trick. Instead, it is the
common sense behind a hiring loop based on a proper metrics. Let’s explore them
in-depth so that you can build a similar hiring loop at your company.</p>

<h3 id="can-the-candidate-do-the-actual-work">Can the candidate do the actual work?</h3>

<p>Or, as we prefer to frame it: can the candidate deliver something that works in
production.</p>

<p>As simple as it looks, this is the main and the first thing you need to measure
about the candidate. Your company is there to build your product, not solve
riddles on a whiteboard. Your hiring loop should select for the ability to
contribute to the former, not the latter.</p>

<p>It is hard to measure the ability to perform without letting candidates do the
actual work. Companies that can’t measure it resort to proxy metrics and
instead try to predict the future. They check what they can, and they hope the
correlation will be on their side. Google used to ask ridiculous brain teasers
(and disgorged a horde of imitations). They stopped doing it because it turned
out to be <a href="https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/">completely useless</a> for hiring. Surprise? No, not at all. Just
another example that using improper metrics will yield unsatisfactory results.</p>

<p>The best way to check that someone can do real work is to allow them to do real
work. That is also the first thing you need to check before you engage in more
expensive interviews. The good news is that it is possible to do both.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-work-together">Can we work together?</h3>

<p>Or, in other words, the cultural fit question.</p>

<p>This metric is orthogonal to the previous, and you should measure it
separately. There will be candidates who can deliver exceptional code but who
can’t cooperate. And there will be candidates who fit your culture like a glove
yet can’t ship a single line of code to production. An efficient hiring loop
accurately handles both of those extremes and anything in between.</p>

<p>Companies usually try to measure this trait with “meet the CEO” style
interviews. That is not enough, as it is prone to unconscious biases of the
person performing the interview. To measure this metric correctly, you would
need to do some self-reflection first. You will need to understand what is the
culture that you are trying to build.</p>

<blockquote>Culture is the Behavior You Reward and Punish
</blockquote>

<p>The tough aspect of this measurement is that it is difficult to automate. It
will likely involve expensive human time, which is expensive to scale with the
demand. Therefore, we recommend performing this measurement at the end of your
hiring pipeline. This way, it will not become a costly bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-candidate-want-to-work-with-me">Does the candidate want to work with me?</h3>

<p>The ultimate decision to join your company belongs to the candidate. They are
the ones who will accept the offer or reject it. Interviews work both ways, and
this phase of the loop is when the candidate measures your company. The
experience you provide to them during the interview will be with them for a
long time. They will share it with their friends and colleagues, tweet about
it, and discuss it online.</p>

<blockquote>They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you
made them feel.<p>Carl W. Buehner</p></blockquote>

<p>Invest in giving them the best experience possible. Your company will stand out
by being friendly, transparent, and approachable. If you want to be bold, allow
them to interview you, and do not judge their questions, but answer them
truthfully. Let them relax and be themselves, and you will help them picking
you for their next adventure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Basing your hiring loop on the right metric could be what turns a stagnating
company into a thriving one. That will allow you to start bringing the best
talent aboard consistently. At this point, you no longer bet on a coin toss.</p>

<p>The next step is to automate the assessment and put it at the beginning of your
hiring loop. That will allow your interviewers to focus only on candidates that
can deliver. At this point, you no longer waste resources.</p>

<p>What’s left is to concentrate on building the best culture you aim to have and
stand out.</p>

</ul><p>The Indian government might soon allow companies to go ahead with a four-day work week. The Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is working on new labour codes which will make way for a three-day weekend, but will keep the </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="working-hours" keynameseo="Working-hours" actualkeyword="Working hours">working hours</keyword><p> at 48 hours a week, which means employees might be subject to long days. 
</p><p>
“Companies will have to give three days’ of paid leaves and 12 hours of work per day to their employees with the consent of the workers. We are not forcing employees or employers. It gives flexibility. It’s an enabling provision in sync with the changing work culture. We have tried to make some changes. We have tried to give flexibility in working days,” said 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/news/business/new-labour-codes-may-allow-4-day-work-week-but-with-longer-hours-3408323.html" rel="nofollow">Labour and Employment Ministry </a>Secretary Apurva Chandra.

Especially, given that employees, in many cases, are made to work beyond five days in a week currently.
</p><p>In India, employees work way beyond 48 hours a week – crossing the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) norms of working. According to the labour standards. “the general standard is 48 regular hours of work per week, with a maximum of eight hours per day.” says the ILO website.
</p><p>
    The changes will be a part of the new labour codes, whose draft rules are being formulated by the government. It will also provide free medical check-ups to workers through the Employees State Insurance Corporation, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-labour-codes-to-allow-4-day-work-week/article33784975.ece" rel="nofollow">reports.</a></p><p>
The four-day work week is not a new topic. It started off as a debate in Germany when the country’s largest trade union – IG Metall, called for a four-day week in 2020. And this, even when Germany already has the lowest working hours in a week at 34.2 hours.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p>Then came Microsoft's experiment in 2019 in its Japan office, where 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/microsoft-experimented-with-a-4-day-work-week-in-its-japan-office-and-productivity-jumped-by-40/articleshow/71901595.cms">productivity jumped by 40%,</a> as a four-day week made for the perfect work-life balance. And it wasn’t just great for the employees; the number of pages printed was down, electricity consumption was a lot less as well. 
</p><p>
A World Economic Forum survey of businesses that had implemented the policy showed that it can help companies “make savings of almost £92 billion (around 2% of total turnover) each year”.
</p><p>
    But there are also challenges said the WEF survey, especially, in the service sector where four days might not be enough to meet consumer expectations and demands.

For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.”<br></p><h3>PayPal Furthers Understanding and Acceptance of Crypto</h3><p>In late 2020, Another U.S.-based financial services provider, PayPal, launched a new feature enabling users to buy, hold, and sell crypto (namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin for now) from their PayPal accounts.<br></p><p>By legitimizing crypto as a funding source for purchases at any of the 26 million merchants around the world where PayPal works, <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">the company aims to “significantly increase cryptocurrency's utility”</a> as well as consumer understanding of the digital currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Fidelity First of Its Kind to Go Digital (Assets, That Is)</h3><p>In the first quarter of 2019, one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $3.3 trillion in assets under management — Fidelity Investments Inc. — started offering Bitcoin custody services via their subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets.<br></p><p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/09/fidelity-digital-assets-now-allows-bitcoin-as-collateral/" target="_blank">Fidelity graduated from just custody operations</a> to launch a Bitcoin mutual fund that’s available to accredited investors. In addition, there’s Fidelity Charitable, which accepts donations in the form of digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>These developments make Fidelity, founded in 1946 in Massachusetts, one of the first among “traditional” financial firms to dive into the world of alternative assets.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration</h3><p>In a 2019 report aptly titled “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown,” the widely-trusted global investment and advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates recommended that institutional investors start exploring digital assets</a> such as crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And exploring they are.&nbsp;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c7623399e336716e88_vZliBvVna390iTpE6RPBeYNkYAtJhtHY_Zc5tsRZQois0d2ijFclg9fdamUMoMGbjAXS8zjeibDjWv1IqZANfh70GK2-nhHhIQN2jC-UU_R4zKoNna1x2TJZIYA5DkKERl6fhoTZ.png" alt="Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration"></p></figure><p>According to a study by the relatively new subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, nearly 80% of the 774 American and European <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">institutional investors they surveyed found digital assets “appealing.”</a>‍</p><p>In fact, close to 40% had already invested in digital assets and 60% said it was only a matter of time before they’d be adding digital assets to their portfolios. Bitcoin was the most popular digital asset among respondents.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">added president of Fidelity Digital Assets, Tom Jessop</a>. “This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.” <br></p><h2>2021 Trends That May Further Crypto’s Acceptance</h2><p>As if major money authorities entering the crypto space isn’t enough, there are even more trends that show how crypto will continue to grow in mainstream acceptance in 2021 and beyond.<br></p><h3>A New American Administration Could Propel Crypto Forward</h3><p>January 20, 2021, marked a drastic shift in American politics as Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful this new party will be more welcoming of digital currency, of which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-i-am-not-a-fan-of-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-105950093.html" target="_blank">the previous administration was “not a fan.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think we have opportunity in a Biden administration,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/11/biden-presidential-win-seen-as-a-good-thing-for-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think what we see with a Biden administration is an opportunity to get some fresh faces into the key regulatory agencies that might be more willing than some of the other regulators that we have today to move forward on policies that would be good for crypto.”<br></p><p>One such fresh face is Gary Gensler — former investment banker; current leader of the Biden–Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team; and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119" target="_blank">nominee for the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fact that Gensler teaches courses on global economics and financial technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management is an indication that his involvement, as well as the involvement of others like him, mean good things for crypto’s advancement in American over the four years, at least.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Your Own Bank Might Even Get On Board With Crypto</h3><p>In the fall of 2020, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-exchange-secures-bank-charter-under-wyoming-law" target="_blank">Kraken was the first cryptocurrency firm in the U.S. to become a bank</a>, thanks to the special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter granted by the state of Wyoming — a surprising early supporter in the mainstream adoption of crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Then in January of 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made a big move in the banking-digital currency relationship by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-prices-jump-after-u-s-regulator-says-banks-can-use-stablecoin-connect-to-blockchains-11609811050#" target="_blank">releasing a letter to U.S. financial institutions permitting them to use stablecoins</a> (a type of cryptocurrency) and participate as nodes in a blockchain.<br></p><p>Translation? U.S. banks are officially legally authorized to deal in crypto-based transactions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We’re happy to agree with the Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1346233501604052992" target="_blank">which called the announcement</a> “ … a giant advance for crypto because it paves the way for these networks to be a formal part of the [U.S.] financial infrastructure.”<br></p><h3>Digital Currency Competitors Are Likely to Rise&nbsp;</h3><p>Noting the gradual — and recently, more meteoric — growth in the value of Bitcoin since it entered the spotlight, it’s only a matter of time before large companies get into the digital currency market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And we think that’s a good thing. In addition to the options that more digital currencies introduce to consumers, they also put pressure on expensive and time consuming traditional transactions to do better.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Facebook’s (newly-named) <a href="https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/facebooks-diem-will-the-global-cryptocurrency-go-live-in-2021#:~:text=Facebook%20and%20the%20Diem%20Association,plans%20have%20been%20made%20official." target="_blank">Diem cryptocurrency is already slated to launch early in 2021</a>.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all of the tools Python offers to scrape the web. We will go from the basic to advanced ones, covering the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover every aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should give you a good idea of what each tool does, and when to use one.</p>
<p><em>Note: When I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will explain the most important to understand for extracting data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model. An HTTP client (a browser, your Python program, cURL, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…). Then the server answers with a response (the HTML code for example) and closes the connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP is called a <em><strong>stateless protocol</strong></em> because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP, for example, is stateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GET verb or method: This means we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>. There are other HTTP verbs, and you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol: In this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields: Connection, User-Agent… Here is an exhaustive list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> This is the domain name of the server. If no port number is given, it is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> This contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS. In this case, it is my web browser (Chrome) on macOS. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (how many users visit my website on mobile vs desktop) or to prevent violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, they can be modified (<em>“Header Spoofing”</em>). This is exactly what we will do with our scrapers - make our scrapers look like a regular web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> These are the content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : This header field contains a list of name-value pairs (name1=value1;name2=value2). These session cookies are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct. If so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user comes from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">HTTP/1.1 <span>200</span> OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 <span>(</span>Ubuntu<span>)</span> Content-Type: text/html; charset<span>=</span>utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset<span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> /&gt; ...<span>[</span>HTML CODE<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. This means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes. They are split into four common classes: 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being “404 Not Found”), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, if you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…), and render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>We will go through the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually Opening a Socket and Sending the HTTP Request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>
PORT <span>=</span> <span>80</span>        <span># Port</span>

client_socket <span>=</span> socket<span>.</span>socket(socket<span>.</span>AF_INET, socket<span>.</span>SOCK_STREAM)
server_address <span>=</span> (HOST, PORT)
client_socket<span>.</span>connect(server_address)

request_header <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>'</span><span>GET / HTTP/1.0</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>Host: www.google.com</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>
client_socket<span>.</span>sendall(request_header)

response <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>'</span>
<span>while</span> True:
    recv <span>=</span> client_socket<span>.</span>recv(<span>1024</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> recv:
        <span>break</span>
    response <span>+</span><span>=</span> str(recv)

<span>print</span>(response)
client_socket<span>.</span>close()  
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE or regex) is a search pattern for strings.</p>
<p>With regex, you can search for a particular character/word in a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers in a web page.</p>
<p>You can also replace items with a regex. For example, you could replace all uppercase tags in a poorly formatted HTML with lowercase tags.</p>
<p>You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by a regex is applied from left to right, and each source character is only used once.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why it is important understand regular expressions when doing web scraping.</p>
<p>After all, there are many different Python modules to parse HTML, with XPath and CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, and the information is embedded inside relevant HTML elements, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy. You will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. For example, if you want to extract specific data inside a large text (a price, a date, a name…), you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>. Also, here is an <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">awesome blog</a> to learn more about them. This post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regex.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression and then use this kind of regex to extract the price:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying but doable to use a regex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. The standard library contains urllib and urllib2 (and sometimes urllib3). In Python3 urllib2 was split into multiple modules and urllib3 won't be part of the standard library anytime soon. This confusing situation will be the subject of another blog post. In this section, I've decided to only talk about urllib3 because it is widely used in the Python world, including by Pip and Requests.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. We urllib3 we could do what we did in the previous section with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, the API is straightforward. Also, you can easily do many other things, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decided to set some headers and use a proxy,
we would only have to do the following (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? There are exactly the same number of lines. However, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily. For example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requests can't: …</p></div></div>

February 10, 2021 | https://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re a developer who mainly works with Go. You go to an event and, while chatting with some people, you decide to share with them the news that you wrote a small tool that does <em>something</em>. You claim that since you wrote it in Go, it’s fairly fast, it’s a single binary, etc. The group seems pleased with your recount and you start feeling good, but then you notice a stranger approaching from behind. A bone-chilling wind blows and you hear: “Why Go and not Rust?”</p>
<p>You start feeling less good. Well, you could answer that Go is what you know, so that’s what you used to solve your problem, but that’s probably not going to be a satisfactory answer. You were pridefully talking about how fast your tool was in the first place, and it’s obvious that the stranger is going to counter your simplistic excuse with all the great benefits that Rust brings over Go.</p>
<p>You start feeling bad. Why did you choose to learn Go in the first place? You were told that Go is fast and that it has great concurrency primitives, and now Rust comes along and everybody is saying that Rust is better in every aspect. Were they lying before or are they lying now? While there is no single language to rule them all, you know that it’s still possible to make bad choices and end up in a technological cul de sac. After all, you did choose Go over <em>that</em> other language a few years ago and you were pretty pleased with the routine of joining circles to ask “Why <em>that</em> and not Go?”</p>
<hr>
<p>While the story above is 100% the result of my imagination, it’s no secret that the Rust fandom has a few <em>overexcited</em> members who feel compelled to enlighten every lost soul about the virtues of the Crab-God. This isn’t really Rust’s fault, every successful project will have misbehaving followers, it’s inevitable. While everyone has to deal with these people, I feel that Go developers are particularly susceptible to their behavior because of how much Rust’s and Go’s <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-mktg101-master/chapter/reading-defining-the-message/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">messaging</a> overlap.</p>
<p>Go is fast, but Rust is faster.  </p>
<p>Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.  </p>
<p>Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.</p>
<p>Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>If you’re a Go developer you might feel a bit cheated. In contrast, Python developers are not particularly fazed by Rust. They know that Python is in many ways slow and inefficient, and they’re fine with that because they know Python’s role: make the code easy to write and offload to C when performance matters.</p>
<p>What about Go? </p>
<h2 id="go-is-very-good-for-writing-services"><a href="#go-is-very-good-for-writing-services" aria-label="go is very good for writing services permalink"></a>Go is very good for writing services</h2>
<p>Go was created at Google to solve Google problems, which mostly involves dealing with networked services. Go’s concurrency model is a good fit for server-side applications that must primarily handle multiple independent requests, rather than participate in complex result-passing schemes. This is one reason why you’re given <code>go</code> and not <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Go has great support for HTTP and related protocols and it doesn’t take long to write a satisfactory web service. In my personal projects, Go proved to be a good alternative to Node.js, especially in situations where I wanted to pin down the interfaces between different components more explicitly than you would do while writing idiomatic JavaScript.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has great tooling to diagnose concurrency and performance problems, and cross-compilation makes deploying on whichever platform a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-unapologetically-simple"><a href="#go-is-unapologetically-simple" aria-label="go is unapologetically simple permalink"></a>Go is unapologetically simple</h2>
<p>Go takes great pride in offering a limited set of features built-in the language. This makes Go easy to learn and, even more importantly, it ensures that Go projects remain understandable even when growing in size.  The creators of Go like to call it a “boring” language. While we could debate whether the language could use one or two extra things, the idea of forcing people to “do more with less” has proven to be very successful.</p>
<p>Rust can indeed be as good as Go at doing web services, or even better, but it really cannot beat Go in terms of simplicity. And it’s not just simplicity, Go is also strict about things that other languages are usually more lax about. Go doesn’t want unused variables or imports, files belonging to different packages in the same directory, etc. It even used to complain about projects saved outside of <code>GOPATH</code> (thankfully that’s not the case anymore). </p>
<p>Go also doesn’t want any “fingerprints” in the code, so it enforces a single, universal style via <code>go fmt</code>.</p>
<p>In truth, none of these things alone is particularly  impressive, but they do describe the mindset that Go wants to impose. Many don’t like it but, in my opinion, it’s a killer feature for some types of development, like enterprise software.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-great-for-enterprise-software"><a href="#go-is-great-for-enterprise-software" aria-label="go is great for enterprise software permalink"></a>Go is great for enterprise software</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, Go was created to solve Google problems, and Google problems are definitely enterprise-scale problems. Whether this was the direct aim of the creators or just the natural result of using it at a Big Corp, Go is indubitably an amazing breath of fresh air in enterprise software development.</p>
<p>If you have experience in writing enterprise software and tried Go, you probably know what I mean. Here’s a quick summary for everyone else.</p>
<p>Enterprise development is a very weird beast compared to other kinds of development. If you’ve never done it, you might ask yourself “What the hell is even enterprise software?” I did that kind of development as a consultant for a bit, so here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<h4 id="enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale"><a href="#enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale" aria-label="enterprise software development is about scale permalink"></a>Enterprise software development is about scale</h4>
<p>Not in terms of total number of users, or amount of data. Often that’s the case too, but the defining characteristics are scale of <strong>scope</strong> and <strong>process</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Enterprise software always has a big scope.</strong> The domain can be big and wide, or narrow but stupidly complex. Sometimes it’s both. When creating software to model such domains, normal programming wisdom falls incredibly short because non-technological concerns out-weight most technological ones. </p>
<p><strong>To unravel complex domains you need a well-structured process.</strong> You need domain experts, analysts, and a mechanism that lets stakeholders gauge how much progress is being made. It’s also often the case that you, the technologist, don’t know the domain very well. Stakeholders and domain experts often won’t understand technology very well either. </p>
<p>This pushes further down technological concerns such as efficiency, <strong>and even correctness.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the business does care about correctness, but they have a different definition for it. When you’re thinking about algorithmic correctness, they are thinking about a reconciliation back-office for the operations team they keep in a country where labor is cheap.</p>
<p>Because of the environment resulting from this general premise, a few well-known enterprise development “quirks” have emerged over time. I’ll name three relevant to my point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are a lot of junior developers</strong> who learn on the job how to program and most are not lucky enough to find a job that will truly teach them anything. In some places, after you’re hired, you are stationed for one week in front of PluralSight and then you’re considered ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Software projects quickly become huge and complex for all the wrong reasons.</strong> Big projects take time to build and people (or whole teams) will come and go in the meantime. Constant refactoring is never an option so each will leave behind a lot of code written with very varying levels of quality. Multiple teams working in parallel will produce redundant code. The domain shifts over time, inevitably invalidating older assumptions and consequently causing abstractions to leak. The more sophisticated an abstraction is, the higher the risk that it will become a problem when business comes back with a serious change request.</li>
<li><strong>The toolchain is very often lousy and/or dated.</strong> This is pretty much the inevitable result of all that I described so far. Huge amounts of old code tie you down to a specific toolset, junior developers will learn the status-quo at best, and the people on top (managers and stakeholders) are extremely often not prepared for making technological decisions based on first-hand experience, the general nature of the endeavor makes them risk-averse, causing them to mainly mimic what other successful players in their space do or, more precisely, what analysts <em>claim</em> other successful players do.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale"><a href="#go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale" aria-label="go is about suppressing complexity at scale permalink"></a>Go is about suppressing complexity at scale</h4>
<p>Go makes teams more successful, partially by giving them more than what they would get with other ecosystems, and partially by taking tools away from them, to prevent common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Go is much easier to learn than Java or C#.</strong> A faster ramp-up is generally good, but it becomes fundamental when the project is lagging behind, the deadline is approaching, and management inevitably resorts to hiring more people, hoping (in vain) to speed things up.</p>
<p><strong>The Go community regards as anti-patterns many abstractions regularly employed by Java / C#</strong>, like IoC containers, or OOP inheritance, for example. There are only two levels of visibility for variables, and the only concurrency model is CSP. It’s way harder to fall into incomprehensible pitfalls when writing in Go than it is in Java / C#. </p>
<p><strong>The Go compiler is fast.</strong> Which means that running tests is going to be faster in general, that deployments will take less time, increasing the overall productivity.</p>
<p>With Go, it’s easier as a junior developer to be more productive, and harder as a mid-level developer to introduce brittle abstractions that will cause problems down the line.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust is less compelling than Go for enterprise software development. That doesn’t mean that Go is perfect, or that it’s not true that Rust has some advantages over Go. Rust has many advantages over Go, but more than anything, I would say that it’s the common perception of Go that is wrong.</p>
<p>Go is not blazing-fast. Go is not super memory-efficient. Go doesn’t have the absolutely best concurrency model. </p>
<p>Go is faster than Java / C#, more memory-efficient …</p></div></div>

		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Memgraph’s biggest new feature in the <a href="https://memgraph.com/blog/memgraph-1-3-release">v1.3 release</a> is the support for replication.</p>
<p>Although replication isn’t a new idea in the database world, it’s a great example to illustrate how often, a simple solution can be the best one.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the concept of replication, and explain how Memgraph implements essential replication capabilities. We will discuss our approach, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. Finally, we’ll explain in detail how do we allow you to pick what property should the replication satisfy for each replica you connect to an instance of Memgraph.</p>
<h2>A Brief Introduction to Data Replication</h2>
<p>Uninterrupted data and operational availability in production systems is critical and can be achieved in many ways.</p>
<p>In distributed systems theory, we talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> (Consistency, Availablity, Partition Tolerance). Out of the three, a distributed system can simultaneously satisfy at most two. Modern systems often implement a hybrid approach where some systems ensure consistency and push availability as high as possible, and others are eventually consistent but available at all times, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j4V5nAT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> are well known to ensure CAP properties. E.g., Raft provides consistency, partition tolerance, and availability if the majority of the cluster is healthy. It also comes with many complexities, which produces performance issues and introduces complexity not required for most known Memgraph use-cases. Mostly running analytical graph workloads on real-time data.</p>
<p>You can achieve those properties by using a much simpler concept called replication. It basically consists of replicating the data from one storage to other storages.
Because the concept is simple, achieving all three of the CAP properties at the same time is not possible. Having a combination of two of those three properties, on the other hand, is achievable.</p>
<h2>Implementing Data Replication</h2>
<p>Even though the idea of replication is simple, trying to add it to a system that has been in development for a few years, is not a trivial task. When the database was designed, the replication hadn’t been taken into consideration, so the biggest challenge was to implement the replication while minimizing the changes to the current implementation of the database.</p>
<p>First, let’s see what are the specifications of the replication we wanted to implement.</p>
<h3>What Can you do with Memgraph’s Data Replication?</h3>
<p>Before we started with the development we had worked out what do we want from our replication feature. As always, that specification evolved throughout the development, even forcing us to delay some features for future releases. We ended up with these basic key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every instance can take the role of MAIN or REPLICA, where the MAIN instance is replicating its data to its replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can register and drop a replica by specifying its
endpoint.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can have multiple replicas registered.</li>
<li>Only the storage is replicated.</li>
<li>Write queries are forbidden on replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can replicate its data in three ways or, as we call them, modes:
<ul>
<li>SYNC - The MAIN instance cannot commit a transaction until the replica has confirmed it received the same transaction.</li>
<li>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT - Same as sync but waits for some set time for confirmation. If the response timeouts, the replica is demoted to an async replica.</li>
<li>ASYNC - The MAIN instance can commit a transaction without waiting for the replica to confirm that it received the very same transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Multiple Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>As we said before, satisfying all three properties of the CAP theorem is practically impossible. But, using these modes, you can pick which of these properties you would like to have for each of your replicas. By replicating the data using the SYNC mode you achieve consistency, by using the ASYNC mode you get availability, and by using SYNC WITH TIMEOUT you try to hold the consistency until something unexpected happens forcing you to give up and accept that availability is good enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/orD51qo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Replication, no matter how simple the idea is, introduces a great number of edge cases that need to be handled in some way or another. This makes it hard to be confident in your implementation (we will never be 100% confident, which is practically a law for multithreaded and distributed applications).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the basic idea behind our implementation of the replication feature and some of the interesting challenges we faced.</p>
<h2>Data Replication Implementation Basics</h2>
<p>The information necessary to implement replication is contained in transaction timestamps and so-called durability files (snapshot files and WALs).</p>
<p>Timestamps allowed us to establish a way of communication between two instances as it represents the current state of an instance. Using the timestamp, the MAIN instance can know what is the current state of the REPLICA and send the correct data for synchronization.</p>
<p>When you apply some changes to the MAIN instance, all those changes are represented by a “delta”. The concept of deltas is not new as we use them for our WAL files. Those deltas contain enough information to be sent to the replicas and be applied correctly.</p>
<p>What if a REPLICA is trailing behind the MAIN instance?</p>
<p>We simply use the durability files to “recover” the REPLICA to the state of MAIN instance. This is more or less how we implemented the replication.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into some specific parts!</p>
<h2>Understanding Different Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>Supporting different replication modes means supporting different ways of waiting for the response after transaction deltas were sent to the REPLICA.</p>
<p>The most straightforward mode is the <em>SYNC</em> mode as the main storage thread simply waits for the response and cannot continue until the response is received.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/09ueVPp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next in line is the <em>ASYNC</em> mode. Okay, we don’t wait for the response in the main thread but in some other thread and we’re done.</p>
<p>Well, there are multiple possibilities here. We can create a thread every time we want to replicate a transaction to the REPLICA, or we can use a single thread every time and simply queue a task that will be executed on that thread. Since creating a thread is not cheap and committing transactions is not something that happens once in 100 years we picked the latter.</p>
<p>The only problem was that we hadn’t implemented something like that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a thread once and dispatching tasks on it isn’t something new. It’s one of the most popular patterns in multithreaded applications, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool">thread pool</a>. So, to support the <em>ASYNC</em> mode we had to add a thread pool implementation. Although we could’ve used an off-the-shelf threading library, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>, we didn’t need all the functionality provided by one so we decided to write our own.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CgEK0q6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we have the <em>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT</em> mode. Things are not so simple here. We have a main thread that wants to commit a transaction, but first, it needs to wait for the REPLICA to commit the same transaction, BUT only for some time after which it should continue replicating the transaction and any future transactions in the background. Let’s split that sentence into 3 key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for a REPLICA to commit a transaction.</li>
<li>If the timeout triggers, commit the transaction on the MAIN instance regardless and switch the REPLICA to <em>ASYNC</em> mode.</li>
<li>Don’t stop the replication of the current transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point tells us to wait for the REPLICA’s response in a background thread so that the main thread can continue its execution even if the replication is not done.</p>
<p>The first point tells us that the main thread needs to wait for a certain time. Now our threads need to communicate somehow. Of course, we use a condition variable that can be notified by a background thread.</p>
<p>And the second point means that we need to have an additional background thread containing a timer that can also notify the main thread.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed easy, but it wasn’t. Our implementation of this looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>active = true
replication_background_thread({
  replicate...
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
timeout_thread({
  finished = false
  while (active &amp;&amp; not timeouted)
      sleep for some time
      
  finished = true
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
while (active) 
  wait
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJkwQg9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using only 3 threads, we already had many interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>For example, we introduced the finished flag because the timeout thread sleeps for some time while it’s active so it doesn’t register immediately that the replication thread finished. During that time another transaction can come in and try to replicate something to the same REPLICA, queue the timeout task, and after that anything is possible because the previous timeout task needs to finish first. This means that it can execute the lines after the while loop at any time which notify the main thread that the response timeouts.</p>
<p>To have things consistent we keep the sleep time at a reasonable value and before waiting for the response we wait for the previous timeout task to finish.</p>
<p>This was really important to do because we want to have the timeout time as exact as possible. If the user-specified the timeout to be 5 seconds, timing out after 10 milliseconds would probably result in angry questions on StackOverflow and/or our Forum.</p>
<p>We also wondered if using concurrency concepts like semaphore would make our lives easier in these cases while not sacrificing the performance.</p>
<h2>How Should the REPLICA Catch up to the MAIN?</h2>
<p>If the MAIN instance concludes that the REPLICA is missing some earlier transactions, the REPLICA goes into a <code>RECOVERY</code> state and remains in this state until it catches up with the MAIN instance.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways of sending the missing data to the REPLICA. The first one is by sending a snapshot, and the second one is by sending the WAL files. One important difference between those 2 files is size. Because snapshot files represent an image of the current state of the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR: Hopsworks Feature Store provides an open ecosystem that connects to the largest number of data storage, data pipelines, and data science platforms. You can connect the Feature Store to Amazon Redshift to transform your data into features to train models and make predictions.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Amazon Redshift is a popular managed data warehouse on AWS. Companies use Redshift to store structured data for traditional data analytics. This makes Redshift a popular source of raw data for computing features for training machine learning models.</p><p>The <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> is the leading open-source feature store for machine learning. It is provided as a managed service on AWS and it includes all the tools needed to transform data in Redshift into features that will be used when training and serving ML models.</p><p>In this blog post, we show how you can configure the Redshift storage connector to ingest data, transform that data into features (feature engineering) and save the pre-computed features in the Hopsworks Feature Store.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To follow this tutorial users should have an Hopsworks Feature Store instance running on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">https://hopsworks.ai</a>. You can register for free with no credit-card and receive 4000 USD of credits to get started.</p><p>Users should also have an existing Redshift cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, you can create one by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/event-publishing-redshift-cluster.html">following the AWS Documentation</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 1 - Configure the Redshift Storage Connector</h2><p>The first step to be able to ingest Redshift data into the feature store is to configure a storage connector. The Redshift connector requires you to specify the following properties. Most of them are available in the properties area of your cluster in the Redshift UI.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/602234d0a3b70153cb637d34_xIgpoz4HkI5nYiN2izzA3-UYqQZS6HImR-D2_U5SdOzsXeURiaX5ihMkiKyAw6iHJK4k8ZFPMBhTEiNBe2t4X-Vq7yYgpAXO2dxw73z0rkMeELNX9TZx9uvVrhwA2seJ-BPZxAap.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Cluster identifier: The name of the cluster</li><li>Database driver: You can use the default JDBC Redshift Driver `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver` (More on this later)</li><li>Database endpoint: The endpoint for the database. Should be in the format of `[UUID].eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com`</li><li>Database name: The name of the database to query</li><li>Database port: The port of the cluster. Defaults to 5349</li></ul><p>There are two options available for authenticating with the Redshift cluster. The first option is to configure a username and a password. The password is stored in the secret store and made available to all the members of the project.</p><p>The second option is to configure an IAM role. With IAM roles,&nbsp;Jobs or notebooks launched on Hopsworks&nbsp; do not need to explicitly authenticate with Redshift, as the HSFS library will transparently use the IAM role to acquire a temporary credential to authenticate the specified user.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, there are two different ways to configure an IAM role: <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/hopsworksai/aws/restrictive_permissions/#step-2-create-an-instance-profile">a per-cluster IAM role</a> or a <a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/admin_guide/cloud_role_mapping.html?highlight=federated%20iam">federated IAM role (role chaining)</a>. For the per-cluster IAM role, you select an instance profile for your Hopsworks cluster when launching it in <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">hopsworks.ai</a>, and all jobs or notebooks will be run with the selected IAM role.&nbsp; For the federated IAM role, you create a head IAM role for the cluster that enables Hopsworks to assume a potentially different IAM role in each project. You can even restrict it so that only certain roles within a project (like a data owner) can assume a given role.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the database driver, the library to interact with Redshift *is not* included in Hopsworks - you need to upload the driver yourself. First, you need to download the library from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver">here</a>. Select the driver version without the AWS SDK. You then upload the driver files to the “Resources” dataset in your project, see the screenshot below. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c30543ea2172d0111008_screesnshot_01.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upload the Redshift Driver (jar file) from your local machine to the Resources dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Then, you add the file to your notebook or job before launching it, as shown in the screenshots below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c33ec4463ca75c8c4db9_screesnshot_02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Before starting the JupyterLab server, add the Redshift driver jar file, so that it becomes available to jobs run in the notebook.</figcaption></figure><h2>Step 2- Define an external (on-demand) Feature Group<br></h2><p>Hopsworks supports the creation of (a) cached feature groups and (b) external (on-demand) feature groups. For cached feature groups, the features are stored in Hopsworks feature store. For external feature groups, only metadata for features is stored in the feature store - not the actual feature data which is read from the external database/object-store. When the external feature group is accessed from a Spark or Python job, the feature data is read on-demand using a connector from the external store. On AWS, Hopsworks supports the creation of external feature groups from a large number of data stores, including Redshift, RDS, Snowflake, S3, and any JDBC-enabled source.&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, we will define an external feature group for a table in Redshift. External feature groups in Hopsworks support “provenance” in the Hopsworks Web UI, you can track which features are stored on which external systems and how they are computed. Additionally HSFS (the Python/Scala library used to interact with the feature store) provides the same APIs for external feature groups as for cached feature groups.</p><p>An external (on-demand) feature group can be defined as follow:</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
# We named the storage connector defined in step 1 telco_redshift_cluster
redshift_conn = fs.get_storage_connector("telco_redshift_cluster")

telco_on_dmd = fs.create_on_demand_feature_group(name="telco_redshift",
                            	version=1,
                            	query="select * from telco",
                            	description="On-demand feature group for telecom customer data",
                            	storage_connector=redshift_conn,
                            	statistics_config=True)

telco_on_dmd.save()
</p><p>When running `save()` the metadata is stored in the feature store and statistics for the data are computed and made available through the Hopsworks UI. Statistics helps data scientists in the quest of building better features from raw data.</p><h2>Step 3 -&nbsp; Engineer features and save to the Feature Store</h2><p>On-demand feature groups can be used directly as a source for creating training datasets. This is often the case if a company is migrating to Hopsworks and there are already feature engineering pipelines in production writing data to Redshift.</p><p>This flexibility provided by Hopsworks allows users to hit the ground running from day 1, without having to rewrite their pipelines to take advantage of the benefits the Hopsworks feature store provides.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_on_dmd\
	.select(['customer_id', 'internet_service', 'phone_service', 'total_charges', 'churn'])\
</p><p>On-demand feature groups can also be joined with cached feature groups in Hopsworks to create training datasets. This <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/generated/query_vs_dataframe/">helper guide</a>&nbsp; explains in detail how the HSFS joining APIs work and how they can be used to create training datasets.<br></p><p>If, however, Redshift contains raw data that needs to be feature engineered, you can retrieve a Spark DataFrame backed by the Redshift table using the HSFS API.<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>You can then transform your `spark_df` into features using feature engineering libraries. It is also possible to retrieve the dataframe as a Pandas dataframe and perform the feature engineering steps in Python code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can then save the final dataframe containing the engineered features to the feature store as a cached feature group:<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_fg = fs.create_feature_group(name="telco_customer_features",
                            	version=1,
                            	description="Telecom customer features",
                            	online_enabled=True,
                            	time_travel_format="HUDI",
                            	primary_key=["customer_id"],
                            	statistics_config=True)
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>Storing feature groups as cached feature groups within Hopsworks provides several benefits over on-demand feature groups. First it allows users to leverage Hudi for incremental ingestion (with ACID properties, ensuring the integrity of the feature group) and time travel capabilities. As new data is ingested, new commits are tracked by Hopsworks allowing users to see what has changed over time. On each commit, statistics are computed and tracked in Hopsworks, allowing users to understand how the data has changed over time.<br></p><p>Cached feature groups can also be stored in the online feature store (`online_enabled=True`), thus enabling low latency access to the features using the online feature store API.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>Get started today on Hopsworks.ai by configuring your Redshift storage connector and run <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/featurestore/aws/redshift/Redshift_pyspark.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>
    <p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">
         <strong>Signal blog post â€œThe ecosystem is movingâ€œ, May 2016</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it. It almost sounds like you have had your soul crushed by bureaucracy over the years and have lost all passion for this field.</p><cite>Full quote available <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">here</a>. It doesn’t get much better.</cite></blockquote>

<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people. I was shocked that more people haven’t done the same. <a href="https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk">https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk</a></p>— Dan Guido (@dguido) <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1159579063540805632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="116" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/soatok_stickerpack-facepaw.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Facepaw!" data-image-description="<p>Facepaw!</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

        <p><span><span></span></span> Allen Pike • February 8, 2021</p>

        

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

            <p>People often use short timezone abbreviations like EST and PST to refer to timezones. If you're doing this in a computer program, you are almost certainly making a huge mistake. Let's take take a look, using the disastrously bad <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html">unix libc timezone tools</a>, which you're almost certainly using under the hood if you're writing software on Linux or OSX.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=UTC date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 12:00:00 AM UTC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alright, this looks good. Let's try to see what time it is in New York:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, New York is 5 hours behind UTC. It outputs the time as <code>EST</code>, so presumably we can use that as a <code>TZ</code> variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EST date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which looks like it works! But that's actually an illusion — say we tried doing this in July, instead of February:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Fri 09 Jul 2021 08:00:00 PM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we're in EDT, since it's daylight saving time. Makes sense, let's just plug that into <code>TZ</code> and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EDT date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>And hang on, <code>America/New_York</code> means <code>EDT</code>, but <code>EDT</code> gives us the time in <code>UTC</code>! What's going on here?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that <code>EDT</code> isn't a valid timezone, and <code>date</code> silently ignores the incorrect timezone variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=LOL_THIS_DOESNT_EXIST date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM LOL
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>date</code> "helpfully" ignores that the timezone is invalid, and outputs the date in UTC, but <em>using the text of the invalid timezone</em>.  Which is horrifying, but wait, why isn't EDT a valid timezone? I'm not sure what the actual reason is, but one reason that it's not correct in the general case to use the short timezone codes is that they aren't actually unique:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/Chicago date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 06:00:00 PM CST
$ TZ=Asia/Taipei date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 AM CST
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are actually two timezones that are canonically named "CST", and they're 14 hours apart! The format that <code>date</code> outputs things in causes there to be two distinct moments in time that correspond to any date outputted in the <code>Asia/Taipei</code> or <code>America/Chicago</code> timezones, and there's no way to tell which is which by looking at it — what fun!</p>

<p>There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like <code>America/New_York</code>, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.</p>

<p>(Hey, if you want to come work with me at Roundforest, and try out ESM on Node.js, feel free to
find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giltayar/">LinkedIn</a> or on Twitter (@giltayar))</p>
<p>ES Modules are the future of modules in JavaScript. They already are the rule in the frontend,
but till now they couldn’t have been used in Node.js. Well, it seems that now they can.
Moreover, the Node.js community is fast at work at adding support for Node.js ESM. This includes
tools like Mocha, Ava, and even Jest (although in Jest the support is incremental). Moreover,
ESlint and TypeScript work nicely with ESM, albeit with a few gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide shows you how to use ESM in Node.js, detailing the basics, and also the gotchas
that you need to be careful with. You can find all the code in the
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">companion code repository</a>. It’s a monorepo
where each package displays a certain facet of Node.js ESM support. This post goes through
each of the packages, explaining what was done there, and what are the gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide turned out to be pretty long, so I broke it into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basics (this document)</li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-2/">“exports” and its uses (including dual-mode libraries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-3/">Tooling and Typescript</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this guide covers <strong>Node.js ESM</strong> and does <em>not</em> cover Browser ESM.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">What do I mean by ESM in Node.js? Don’t we have that already? <a href="#what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>ESM is the standard JavaScript module system (ESM is a shorcut for
JavaScript Modules, and is also called ESM, or EcmaScript modules,
whereby “EcmaScript” is the official name for the JavaScript language).
ESM is the “newer” module system, and is supposed to be a replacement for the
regular Node.js module system, which is CommonJS (CJS for short), altought CommonJS will probaby
stil be with us for a very very long time. The module syntax is this:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> add <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./add.js"</span></p></code></pre>
<p>(An intro to ESM is out of scope of this guide, but you can find it <em>everywhere</em> today on the
internet)</p>
<p>ESM was standardized in 2015, but it took awhile for browsers to support this,
and it took even longer for Node.js to support it
(the final stable version in Node.js was finalized only in 2020!).
If you want more information, you can see my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>. In the talk, at the end,
I discuss whether ESM is ready for work, and I say that it’s not quite there yet,
and people should start migrating to it in a year or two. Well, that year is NOW, and it’s READY,
and this guide will prepare you for that.</p>
<p>Some of you may be nodding your head and asking themselves: aren’t we already using that? Well,
if you are, then you’re transpiling your code using Babel or TypeScript, which support ESM
out of the box and transpile it to CJS. The ESM this post is talking about is <em>native</em> ESM
that is supported by Node.js without transpiling. While syntactically it is the same, there
are small differences between it and Babel/TypeScript ESM, differences which are discussed
in my Node.TLV talk above. Most importantly, native ESM in Node.js does not need transpiling,
and so doesn’t come with the baggage of problems transpiling comes with.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">Give it to me straight. Can I start using ESM in Node.js? <a href="#give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Mostly yes. All the tooling I use supports it, but there are two BIG gotchas that are probably
hard to swallow for some people, gotchas that are hard to workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jest support for ESM in Node.js is <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules">experimental</a></li>
<li>Jest experimental support does not support yet mocking modules
(regular function/object mocking is supported)</li>
<li><code>proxyquire</code> and other popular module mockers do not yet support ESM (although <code>testdouble</code>
fully support it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of support for module mockers. There <em>is</em> one mocking
library that does support ESM (<code>testdouble</code>[<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble">https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble</a>]),
and we use that in this guide.</p>
<p>So can you live with this? If you can, then going all in with ESM in Node.js is now totally
possible. I’ve been using it for four months now, with zero problems. Actually, it feels
like VSCode support for ESM is much better than for CJS, so I suddenly get auto imports of modules,
and other goodies, which I didn’t get before in the CJS world.</p>

<p>This guide comes with a monorepo that has 7 directories, each directory being a package
that demonstrates the above sections of the Node.js support for ESM. You can find the monorepo
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-node.js-esm-project"><a id="section-01"></a>The simplest Node.js ESM project <a href="#the-simplest-node.js-esm-project">#</a></h2>
<p>Companion code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs</a></p>
<p>This is the simplest package, and demonstrates the basics of the basics.
Let’s start by exploring <code>package.json</code>, and the new <code>exports</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="main-and-.mjs"><code>main</code> and <code>.mjs</code> <a href="#main-and-.mjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json</a></p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><br>  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"01-simplest-mjs"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/main.mjs"</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The main entry point is <code>src/main.mjs</code>. Why does the file use the <code>.mjs</code> extension? Because in
Node.js ESM, the <code>.js</code> extension is reserved for CJS and <code>.mjs</code> means that this is a JS module
(in the next section, we’ll see how to change that). We’ll talk a bit more about that in the next
part.</p>
<p>Let’s continue exploring <code>main.mjs</code>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-using-extensions">Importing using extensions <a href="#importing-using-extensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs</a></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>bannerInColor<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./banner-in-color.mjs"</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>banner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>bannerInColor</span><span>(</span><span>"white"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Look at the import statement that imports <code>banner-in-color</code>:
Node.js ESM <em>forces</em> you to specify the full relative path to the file, <em>including the extension</em>.
The reason they did this is to be compatible with Browser ESM (when using ESM in browsers,
you always specify the full name of the file, including the extension). So
don’t forget that extension! (You can understand more about this in my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and so Ctrl/Cmd+Clicking it won’t work,
and its built in intellisense doesn’t work on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and ignores files with that extension. In
the next section we’ll see how to deal with that, so it’s not a <em>real</em> gotcha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <code>main.mjs</code> exports the <code>banner</code> function, which will be tested in <code>test/tryout.mjs</code>. But
first, let’s explore <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code>, which contains most of the implementation of
the <code>banner()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">Importing ESM and CJS paclages <a href="#importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how we can import ESM modules. Let’s see how to import other packages:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>join<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"path"</span><br><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>We can import Node.js internal packages like <code>path</code> easily, because Node.js
exposes them as ES modules.</p>
<p>And if we had a ESM package in NPM, the same could have been used to import the ESM package.
But most of the pacakges NPM has are still CJS packages. As you can see in the second line, where
we import <code>chalk</code>, CJS packages can also be imported using <code>import</code>. But for the most part,
when importing CJS modules, you can only use “default” importing, and not “named” imports. So
while you can import named imports in a CJS file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"chalk"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> do this in a ESM file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'chalk'</span></code></pre>
<p>You can only import the default (non-named) import, and use destructuring later:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? It’s complicated, but the gist of it is that when loading modules,
ESM does not allow <em>executing</em> a module to determine what the exports are,
and so the exports need to be determined statically.
Unfortunately, in CJS, executing a module is the only reliable way of determining
what the exports are. Node.js actually tries very hard to figure out what the named exports are
(by parsing the module using a very fast parser),
but my experience is this method doesn’t work for most packages that I’ve tried this with,
and I need to fall back to default importing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: importing a CJS module is easy, but you mostly can’t use named imports and need
to add a second line to destructure out the named imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that in 2021, more and more packages will have ESM entry points that export
themselves as ESM with the proper named exports. But for now, you may need the additional
destructuring to use named imports from CJS pacakges.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await">Top-level await <a href="#top-level-await">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>Continuning our exploration of <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code> we find this extraordinary line
that reads a file from the disk:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> text <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>"text.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"utf8"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Why so extraordinary? Because of that <code>await</code>. This is an <code>await</code> that is outside an <code>async</code>
function, and is at the top level of the code. This kind of <code>await</code> is called “top-level await”
and is supported since Node.js v14. It is extraordinary because it is the only feature in Node.js
that is available <em>only</em> in ESM modules (i.e. not available in CJS). Why is that? Because
ESM is an async module system, and so supports async operations when loading the module,
while CJS is loaded synchronously and so cannot support <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Great feature, and only in ESM! 🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>
<p>But notice the use of <code>__dirname</code> in the line above. Let’s discuss that.</p>
<h3 id="__dirname"><code>__dirname</code> <a href="#__dirname">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>If you try to use <code>__dirname</code> in ESM, you will find that it is not available
(just like <code>__filename</code>). But if you need it, you can quickly determine it using these lines:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> url <span>from</span> <span>"url"</span><p><span>const</span> __dirname <span>=</span> url<span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"."</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span>meta<span>.</span>url<span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Complex? Yes. So let’s deconstruct this code to understand it.</p>
<p>First off, the expression <code>import.meta.url</code> is part of the ESM spec, and its purpose
is the same as the CJS <code>__filename</code>, except …</p></div></div>

    <p><strong>How I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for&nbsp;me.</strong></p>

<p>I know. I know. I know! Using my inbox as my to-do-list is considered <a href="https://www.curaytor.com/blog/Your-Inbox-is-Not-a-To-Do-List">bad practice</a>, and I should feel bad for even trying.</p>

<p>Several well known time management books explicitly advise against this approach. Based on this advice, I have tried different tools and techniques to create a to-do-list <em>separate</em> from my inbox. Yet the honest truth is that all of these attempts didn’t work nearly as well for me as my current Gmail setup.</p>

<p>I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for me. I will try to explain why and how. Perhaps it can work for you too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-1-most-of-my-tasks-are-emailsalready">Realisation #1: Most of my tasks are emails&nbsp;already.</h2>

<p>My job revolves around communicating with people. Emails inevitably form a large part of that communication. Most of the things I get “done” get done through email. Most of the things I need to get done next will also get done through email.</p>

<p>When I try to keep a to-do-list separate from my inbox, most of the tasks that end up on that to-do-list started life as an email, or will at least result in an email eventually. Moving all of those emails to a separate to-do-list is a chore; moving them back to an email doubly so. Using my inbox as my to-do-list saves me a lot of work simply moving tasks back and forth.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all tasks start with an email. However, effective to-do-list management becomes a lot easier when all tasks are collected in <em>one place</em> (as opposed to being distributed across notebooks, sticky notes on my desk, apps on my phone, and my email).  So, since I have decided to use my inbox as my to-do-list, I need to ensure that somehow  all my tasks arrive as emails there, even those tasks that were not sent to me by other people.</p>

<p>The solution to that problem is rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="trick-1-i-email-tasks-tomyself">Trick #1: I email tasks to&nbsp;myself.</h3>

<p>Emailing myself about the odd task that does <em>not</em> already involve an email in my inbox feels like less work than moving everything else back and forth between two lists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is <em>extremely flexible</em>. Sometimes I email myself just a subject. Sometimes I write whole paragraphs of text in the body to remind myself of the details of the task.  Sometimes I add links to other things. Sometimes I reply to myself and post updates to keep track of my progress. Sometimes I carbon copy people who depend on the completion of the task, letting them know that I have documented this task and will get back to them later.</p>

<p>Inbox-as-to-do-list supports rich notes and collaborative tasks out of the box. Everyone I know already has an account and knows how to use this open platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-email-task.png" alt="A screenshot of composing an email addressed to &quot;Bob&quot; telling him it is a reminder for myself to do &quot;that thing&quot;."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-2-time-management-is-attention-management">Realisation #2: Time management is attention management.</h2>

<p>Visual clutter clutters my mind. Anything I can see can distract me. The less there is to see on the screen, the less I will be distracted. To help me focus on the most important tasks, I try to hide everything else.</p>

<h3 id="trick-2-simplifygmail">Trick #2: Simplify&nbsp;Gmail.</h3>

<p>Simplify is an awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj">Chrome extension</a> that simplifies the Gmail interface to the bare minimum. Most of the interface elements are useless anyway, because I use the keyboard to navigate (more on that later).</p>

<p>(I used to maintain a personal fork of Simplify that would hide <em>even more</em> of the interface - such as the giant”plus” in the bottom right of the screen - but then I realised I could just use my ad-blocker to block those specific components. Much easier, and just as effective.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-3-separate-gmail-from-thebrowser">Trick #3: Separate Gmail from the&nbsp;browser.</h3>

<p>I use Gmail through the web interface. Often I have several other tabs open at the same time. When I’m browsing, the Gmail tab distracts me. When I’m emailing, the other tabs distract me. Browsing and email are separate tasks that should live in separate apps.</p>

<p>Chrome can <a href="https://www.webnots.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-of-a-site-from-google-chrome/">create a shortcut</a> to Gmail that opens as a new window. That way, Gmail behaves like a separate app, rather than just another tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-chrome-create-shortcut.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome showing the menu entry to create a shortcut."></p>

<h3 id="trick-4snooze">Trick #4:&nbsp;Snooze.</h3>

<p>Tasks I do not need to focus on right now need to be out of <em>sight</em> and out of <em>mind</em>. If they are not, these currently unimportant tasks continue to take up valuable brain space, even when I am not actively working on them.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two main ways in which a postponed task can impinge on my attention:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I see the task, I will think about the task.</em> Simply looking at a list of tasks is a great way to destroy my concentration. So many things to do! So little time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I postpone a task, I need to know for sure that I will get back to it later.</em> This one is a bit more subtle, but nevertheless important. A postponed task tends to linger in my mind if I am not absolutely confident that I will be reminded about it later. Fear of forgetting is the mind-killer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I need a way to completely hide a task, but I also need to know that it will be back. Luckily, Gmail has a <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">“snooze” feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Postpone emails and <strong>temporarily remove them from your inbox</strong> until you need them. Your email <strong>will come back to the top of your inbox</strong> when you want it to, whether that’s tomorrow, next week, or this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I snooze frequently. I snooze ruthlessly. I snooze without regret.</p>

<p>Snoozing helps me avoid both of the attention traps above: the email disappears from view, and yet I can be absolutely confident that I will be reminded of it in the future, because it will come back directly to my inbox.</p>

<p>Deliberately deciding to postpone a task by actively snoozing it feels much better than pretending to ignore it for a while. Managing my own attention makes it more likely I will actually get to the task eventually. It’s not “goodbye”, it’s “see you later”.</p>

<p>Can it wait? Great!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-bob-can-wait.png" alt="A screenshot of an email in Gmail with the Snooze menu expanded."></p>

<h3 id="trick-5-disable-notifications">Trick #5: Disable notifications.</h3>

<p>Email is an asynchronous communication channel. It can usually wait a few hours. I will be checking my to-do-list several times a day in between tasks anyway. Notifications are a distraction and a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="trick-6-close-gmail-while-working-on-atask">Trick #6: Close Gmail while working on a&nbsp;task.</h3>

<p>The purpose of a to-do-list is to help me decide what task I should be working on next. I do not need my to-do-list if I already know what I should be working on, or while I am working on a task. To avoid being distracted by other tasks on the list, or by new emails arriving in my inbox, I close Gmail while working on a task.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-3-time-spent-managing-the-tasks-is-not-spent-doing-thetasks">Realisation #3: Time spent managing the tasks is not spent doing the&nbsp;tasks.</h2>

<p>The best to-do-list is obviously an empty list with no tasks on it remaining to be done. Empty is what we should be striving for.</p>

<p>I get more things done when I spend more time doing the things to be done. I want to spend as little time as possible navigating, organising, and managing my tasks.</p>

<h3 id="trick-7-use-the-keyboard-for-navigation">Trick #7: Use the keyboard for navigation.</h3>

<p>Using a mouse requires squinting at the screen, searching for the pointer, and directing it with precision. After clicking on the compose or reply button, writing an email then requires switching context and placing both hands on the keyboard for textual input. Over the course of a day, quite a bit of time is spent just navigating around and switching context.</p>

<p>Conversely, using the keyboard for navigation relies more on muscle memory and hammering out well worn patterns (open email, delete email, archive email, snooze email, reply-all, send email, etc). In addition, there is no switching cost between the navigation and the writing of an email.</p>

<p>I avoid using the mouse as much as possible. I use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> instead. After a few days of practice (and hitting&nbsp;<code>?</code> for the cheatsheet a lot), I never looked back. I now spend far less time navigating, and thus more time doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-shortcuts.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet."></p>

<h3 id="trick-8-dont-use-filters-orfolders">Trick #8: Don’t use filters or&nbsp;folders.</h3>

<p>I used to have filters and folders. Lots and lots of filters and folders. They were only hiding the real problem: I was getting too many emails. More emails than I could ever hope to read. Worse still, I wasn’t even sure why I was even trying just to <em>read</em> them.</p>

<p>If an email requires an action from me, it should go to my inbox so I can prioritise it. If an email does not require an action from me, I should not be getting it.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no FYI.</p>

<p>(I realise this trick is probably the most controversial of all the tricks listed in this post. If you very strongly disagree - and you want to explain to my why I am wrong - feel free to <a href="http://lukasvermeer.nl/#contact">send me an email</a>. You can be assured it will go straight to my inbox.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-9-use-labels-as-visualcues">Trick #9: Use labels as visual&nbsp;cues.</h3>

<p>Some tasks are more important than others. I use coloured labels to draw attention to more urgent and important tasks in my inbox.</p>

<p>My labelling scheme is intentionally simplistic. I use labels as temporary indicators, not for permanent organisation or structure. Organisation and structure are only distractions from the ultimate goal of ending up with an empty list anyway. An empty list does not need either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-labels-urgent.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail inbox showing two emails one of which is marked as urgent."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-4-i-cannot-do-everything-today">Realisation #4: I cannot do everything today.</h2>

<p>Every morning there are more tasks in my inbox than I can reasonably hope to complete in one day. After denial, anger, bargaining, and depression comes acceptance of the simple fact that effective time management involves deliberately  deciding what <em>not</em> to spend time on.</p>

<h3 id="trick-10-start-the-day-snoozing">Trick #10: Start the day snoozing.</h3>

<p>Every morning I start my day by snoozing everything that I don’t expect to get done that day. This usually takes a few minutes scanning through my inbox. If something new and important comes up later, I immediately reevaluate if another task should now be pushed out to tomorrow. If so, I snooze without delay.</p>

<p>The reality is that I cannot do everything, so I must eventually always choose. Choosing as early as possible ensures that I will have as much time available as possible for the most important tasks. Snoozing as early as possible ensures that less important tasks take up as little of my attention as possible during the day.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I snooze rather than wait or deliberate. Snoozing is a two-way door decision: it is easily reversed. If I happen to finish all my …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute. Execution is everything. Everyone has big ideas â€” no startup ideas are truly unique. Being able to execute on those ideas is what will turn that idea into a business.</p><p>For any idea, the most important next step is thorough research where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information.

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>
